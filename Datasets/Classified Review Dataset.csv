0,0,"We have been going to Dal Rae for many years. Never disappointed. However this visit was a very different experience.
First of all, the hosts were very accommodating. They sat us within 15 minutes although we arrived 45 minutes before our reservation time.
We were sat at the bar area. From the very beginning we felt like our server was rushing us to order. We ordered two pomegranate margaritas and it didnât taste like what we expected. So we asked to return it and got two glasses of Merlot instead. We can tell our server was not happy about it from her facial expression. We finished our food and we need some to go boxes. The bus person came and took our plates away in very rush manner and didnât even ask us where the untouched baked potato goes. He rushed the food to the packing area, packed and brought them back. We felt like we were rushing to leave the restaurant but it was only 9PM.
During our dinner, we had this couple sitting next to us. Apparently they were either old staffs or long time customers. Almost everyone in the restaurant came greet them. They were so loud that at one point we have to talk louder than them so they realized they were loud.
We clearly didnât enjoy our evening.",0
1,1,"Very mediocre at best. Many other restaurants I can spend $350.00 and get much better all around. Better food, better service, better ambiance. Very disappointing, save your money and go elsewhere.",1
2,2,"Have been dining here at least once or twice a year for about 30 years.
Decided to go in for lunch to get the traditional Shrimp Louie I had been craving.
Was so disappointed to see it was now made with shredded lettuce and small rock shrimp. Not at all what it used to be!
My niece got the Medallions of Filet it should have been described as a medallion of fillet.   
Maybe it was just going in for lunch service, even the wait staff was not up to usual standards.
Sorry to say not sure if Iâll ever go back.
Wish they would just raise the prices and keep the quality of both the food and staff.",0
3,3,"This was Valentine's Day, and we were looking forward to our dinner. It was a big disappointment ,the service was slow, food didn't come out in a timely manner, and we were rushed, we will never return for one of these prefix menus again. We really like this place it has always been top service and great food. Hopefully, this was just a bad day.",0
4,4,"Iâve been coming to Dal Rae for years. I wanted to have Galentines dinner with my close girlfriends, so I booked the place. We sat at the bar while we waited for our party to arrive. The bartender was excellent and Efficient. We sat at our table, and the service went downhill from there. The server took forever to greet us and get our drinks. He offered to tell my friends the main dishes because it was their first time there. He forgot half the speech. We never got our drinks, we had to ask for service multiple times. Other parties were fed and waited on and left before we got our food. We were seated under an AC vent, and asked to have it lowered because it made our food cold. We had to wear our jackets for the same reason. We ordered a bottle and it took an hour to get to us. Our reservation was for 8:30 and we didnât leave till 11:45 because of the poor service. By the time we got to dessert everything was gone. Such a huge disappointment because Dal Rae is known for quality service and food.",0
5,5,"WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PLACE NOW? SERVICE WAS BAD(HOSTESS GAVE US TWO HOURS TO EAT SHE SAID SO!
FOOD ORDER WAS WRONG. RECEIVED BOOLD RARE STEAK. ORDER IT MED. WELL DONE!
HOSTESS TOOK IT BACK BECAUSE THE SERVER WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!
CHEF DELIVERED SECOND STEAK WITH NO FORK TO EAT WITH. I HAD TO SCREAM FOR A FORK? WHAT???
MANAGER APOLOGIZED, BUT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME.
I DROPPED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF COIN IN THIS PLACE OVER THE LAST 35+ YEARS, WHEN THE MANAGEMENT WAS DIFFERENT AND BETTER. NEW PEOPLE ARE $$$ HUNGRY AND THE RESTAURANT IS SUFFERING. NO RELISH TRAY ANYMORE, GIANT PLATE WITH LITTLE BITTY AMOUNTS OF FOOD THAT COST AN ARE AND A LEG.
LASTLY THE VALET TOOK HIS TIME RETRIEVING OUR VEHICLE, IN THE COLD, WE WAITED AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES, SHIVERING THE WHOLE TIME!!!
ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO TEN, I GIVE YOU A FOUR(4).
USED TO RATE THIS PLACE A TEN(10). NOT WITH NEW OWNERS THOUGH.
MANAGER SHOULD HAVE COMPT MY DINNER AT LEAST, NO, ONLY TWO DRINKS COMPT, BIG DEAL.
THIS WAS MY WOMENS 67th BIRTHDAY!
SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HER TO Lawrys. BETTER SERVICE AND FOOD.
I WILL NOT BE BACK TO THIS RIP=OFF HUT AGAIN!!!
THANKS FOR NOTHING!",0
6,6,"I have been your place many-many times but your service of last night was very bad. I am very disappointed. since I have another appointment with you next week, I will go again but I may not make any more reservation in future.
Receptionist...Very bossy, Serve....Very slow, but also you tried kick us out due to too many persons were waited ..may be....   Is this right way to do ????",1
7,7,Had reservations 8 pm didnât get seated til 9:30 ate dinner at 11:00 pm and had to sit in the noisy bar area,0
8,8,"Had to wait 25 minutes past reservation time to be seated and even had to remind the hostess we were still waiting.  Food wasnât bad, but wouldnât bother making a second reservation.",0
9,9,"I went to this location expecting something comparable to water grill since the pricing was relatively the same and let me tell you that it was a miserable disappointment! Sat at the bar and got drinks to start the night and my old fashion was made incorrectly and my girlfriendâs margarita was grapefruit water. Moved over to be seated and they were nice to replace the table cloth since it was dirty. And then we split a salad and ordered the angel hair pasta with a custom request of having it with shrimp. The salad was good, pretty basic but did the job. The pasta was overtly buttered and there was 5 shrimp per pasta dish. To my amazement, each pasta dish went from $20 ea. to $43 because of 5 shrimp LOL what a scam! We could have gotten chilean sea bass for $10 more. Never going to this location again and even the valet didnât give me the correct amount of cash back. Do better!!",0
10,10,"Wait staff was very helpful and kind. Unfortunately the food was generic and not prepared well enough. There was nothing special or memorable about neither the food nor the drinks. It's hard to say all this about a place where the staff was SO friendly, but the food and drinks were LESS desirable than a typical restaurant. The best food was the two sides ordered. I expected much more originality. Especially from the cocktail menu (even Chili's has their own signature cocktails, why not Dal Rae?). $200 for 2 is better spent elsewhere, like The Cellar in Fullerton.

Food ordered:
Cesar salad for 2
Filet Mignon w/ rice pilaf
Pork Chop w/ mashed potatoes
Drinks ordered:
Dark 'n' Stormy (hard to mess up this classic drink but somehow it was not good)
Cucumber lime Martini",0
11,11,"It took1 hour for them to take our order 
And we hardly saw our waiter",1
12,12,"Food wasnât the best, service was the worst.. not attentive at all",1
13,13,Terrible experience from start to finish  outback quality,1
14,14,"We had the Dine LA lunch and the food was terrible ,

Calamari was cold and not crisp, Wedge Salad was all Dressing and hardly any lettuce
Fish was tasteless and the only thing good was our server, She was supper funny and 
nice",0
15,15,LOBSTER THERMIDOR SINCE THEY LOST THEIR KEY CHEF IS HORRIBLE THE LAST TWO TIMES I HAVE GONE!!!! Have gone all my life over 50 years. Will not be returning as it was that bad and soup was cold! Unfortunate as management does t really care either,1
16,16,"Made the mistake dining close to closing time - baked potatoes were old, error on order.  Ordered filet mignon, server brought out filet mignon with pepper sauce.  They took back the plate, removed the sauce, placed on the grill and sent back.  It was full of pepper......  Sent back to the kitchen.

(1) Should never have ""cleaned up' the filet mignon.  Should not have been done in the first place.  
(2) Should not serve old food that is reheated, especially a baked potato.

Disappointing.... which begs the question.... did they think our party didn't know any better????????????",0
17,17,"I've eaten at Dal  Rae before and enjoyed it.  This visit was a huge disappointment.  I was with a party of seven friends celebrating our yearly  gift exchange.  It's always a fun time.  However, this dinner was so miserable everyone couldn't wait to leave.  They placed our table near an open side door.  As we were sitting down, we all immediately complained that it was very cold.  The hostess explained that they had to leave the door open because they were serving on the patio.  She went on to explain that the heater placed was placed near the door to keep us warm.   As the restaurant was full, we accepted it.  The heater did nothing to warm the interior of the restaurant near our table.  We got colder.  By the end of the night, we were all popsicles.  Half of our food was cold the other half lukewarm.  We waited 1 1/2 hours for our food to arrive.  We were so cold and fed up that most of the food was packed to go. Our repeated complaints went ignored until it was time to go.  The manager offered to take care of it on our bill.  His idea of taking care of it was reducing our bill by about 30%.   This is an event that my friends and I look forward to every year for the past 10 years especially since we were unable to get together in person last year.  We were so disappointed...  We will definitely not take our event to Dal Rae again. The reduction in the bill, in no way made up for the numb feet and hands while sitting at a dinner table zipped up to our necks in coats. Or how our waiter and hostess tried to pretend we weren't freezing. That they were so busy that they did not offer another table or that our food, when it finally came was cold.",0
18,18,Absolutely the worst steak Iâve ever hadâ¦everâ¦dry and over cookedâ¦the management made it right by taking it off our bill but still it wasnât goodâ¦the lobster bisque was overly salty and salt is my favorite condiment so thatâs saying a lot!,1
19,19,Second time main hostess was rude ruined my friends birthday! So much for making reservations there !!  We were long time loyal customers know weâre never going back!! Thank goodness for steak ân Stein it save the night,0
20,20,The service was good but we had to send back our drinks because they were so bad. All of our meals with steak were cooked incorrectly and unevenly so we ended up having to trade amongst ourselves at the table. Overall disappointing as the food here used to be consistently good.,0
21,21,Food was awful and cold! Cesar salad was brown. I will never return.,1
22,22,"I've eaten at this restaurant on many occasions, but this past time I was not impressed with the food and service, our food was wrong and it was cold, from the time we sat down to the time we finished our dinner it was 3 frustrating hours, I understand we're going through some rough times with Covid-19, but if we're trying to help our local restaurants I feel that they should be putting a little more effort to please the customers.   
Would I come back? Probably.
Will I recommend this place to a friend? Yes, with a warning.",0
23,23,"Service was terrible. Our first time there, will not be back. We were brought out a try of sorry looking veggies, presentation could have been so much better. They could have also been fresher they looked all wilted. I don't mine paying for a good meal, but disappointed with food & for the price of the food I expect great service.",0
24,24,People should leave their kidâs at home.,1
25,25,The receptionist in the front lobby  was totally uptight took me to a different place I came here to enjoy and take my mind off of what going on in life.. Thank God she was not our waitress.,1
26,26,"We go here every year, I donât think anyone wanted to complain but when we left we realized we all had the same experience, cold food, the crab legs were dry and cold, my moms prime rib was cold, the soup was cold, and it took an hour to even get an appetizer order in. It ruined our evening, my mom even came home sick. Iâm not used to this and I will be contacting the manager tomorrow. Everyone was busy and overwhelmed last night. I couldnât here myself talk over the music so I figured I would reach out to management on a different day. Super disappointed",0
27,27,"First time there, heard so much about this place. The place looks run down, the sign said proper attire but you had people dressing like they are going to Walmart; jeans, flannels, soccer jerseys, so donât expect the people to respect the rules nor is it enforced. The bar was packed, so we waited outside and thereâs just no ambiance. Got seated, and the relish plate to cleanse your palette is disgusting, the bread served with it was cold. Our server was polite and delightful but she didnât tell us about any specials, she delivered us a cheese bread ( probably because she forgot to give us proper introductions). The place is SO LOUD and not romantic, too many tables jammed in that the waiters can pass by with plates or proper tableside. Our food was okay, the petit filet should have been ordered with the pepper sauce, it overpowered the taste of the steak; which was cooked perfect. Husbands dish was also very good, wine pairings were available to match the sauces. I wonât be back, it was just too overpriced for a good steak that I can elsewhere and with better ambiance and dinner selections.",0
28,28,"Food was ok,",1
29,29,"What a costly disappointment.  First comes the traditional relish tray with mostly ice and a few sparse not-so-fresh items.  Then the cheese bread tasting oily.  ""There are three different guys in the kitchen making it and they all think they have the best wayt!""  - our waitress.   Stick to your old formula!  Then the Caesar was NOT made tableside (SO disappointing).  The lobster tail was so average ($82.00).  The big prime rib ($60.00) ordered ""medium"" had no pink and was NOT tender.  What has happened?  So expensive and everything was not up to their standard.  Not sure if I will take the chance again.  It is a shame that they would allow this.  They seem to overbook and it steals from the ambiance.  We spent a fortune for a meal and it was a huge disappointment.  Also, we got there early...there was a sign for the valet price...when we left to get our car the price had gone up!!  And this is the second time we have been in the lounge and the Latina bartender could not smile and be cordial.  An attitude like you were interrupting her-the big boss-couldn't be bothered.  Just rude.",0
30,30,"Service was horrible, food took 1.5 hours to be served with a reservation. Was celebrating a 50th birthday and not once did the waitress acknowledge this. Informed manager he offered free dessert which was communicated by another employee who approached us while waiting on the valet. Dal Rae was my favorite restaurant they will not be going forward. Horrible experience!",0
31,31,Food prices are very high mediocre food and below service average.,1
32,32,"Horrible experience from beginning to end.  Food was so so, and service is unbelievable.  We went for lunch with a reservation.  We felt neglected from the moment we stepped in.  No courtesy when they spoke to us, and never checked in on us even when the place was only half full.  We had to ask twice for more drink.  We had to look around for 10 minutes asking for a to-go box and the check.  When we left, no one even bothered to say thank you or goodbye.  I felt like I owe them a million bucks.  It's beyond me.  Never again!",0
33,33,My experience was very poor my girlfriend and I went to have dinner she did not like the sauce on her veal. We asked our waitress to take it back when they returned a new plate without the sauce it was the same veal beyhadh you scrape the sauce off of it we asked the waitress if it was the same one she said no she recanted and said it was the manager then came and stated that they had scraped off the sauce but it was the same veal. A $40 dish and the only complimented us dessert. The that type of Steakhouse that is supposed to be they do not have scraped off the sauce. It was a a very bad experience,0
34,34,"Weâve been coming here since I was in high school, and this by far was the WORST experience ever! Yes, I understand it was New Years Eve, BUT our server was honestly awful. Our table next to us who was sat after us, received their bread, drinks and salads before we even got our first drinks and water, and then when our salads finally came our server had our order wrong. We were sat next to the thermostat and another server squeezed her way in between our table to change the temperature and her butt was literally on our table for what seemed forever and not one excuse me or pardon me like are you kidding me !!??! Thatâs soo awful! Our server never checked in on us, our plates were piling on our table never cleared. That table next to us even had desert before our entrees came out. Honestly this was just an awful way to ring in the New Years,  never again.",0
35,35,"When we made the reservation on open table, we indicated that it was for our anniversary.  In the past, we were seated in the better lit section of the restaurant and a complimentary dessert was given to us.  This time, we were seated in the ""holiday"" section where it was difficult getting in and out of booth.  There wasn't anything festive about the atmosphere.  The waitstaff did not engage us.  Never did they ask if we were celebrating a special occasion.  We were actually celebrating, not only our 29th anniversary, but our son's first job.
It took a long time to bring the food.  The salad was good, but the entrees did not come out at room temperature...as if it had been sitting awhile.

We've always loved celebrating at Dal Rae's in the past, but this experience will send us looking elsewhere next year",0
36,36,"We have come here many times over the years. This was our first time back in about two years. The food was average however the service and noise level was absolutely unacceptable. I understand that everyone can have a bad night however this was much more than that. The only good thing that occurred was we ran into a server from another one of our favorite restaurants. Very sad situation this was an iconic establishment at one time, I don't believe my wife and I will return. I can be reached at 562 696-1209 
                                                                                                                      Sincerely, Steve & Colette, Sbelgio",1
37,37,"Restaurant was busy, but our reserved table was waiting for us upon arrival.
I noted on our reservation that this was an ""Anniversary"" dinner and the waiter immediately wished us a Happy Anniversary after introducing himself.
Service was very attentive, and there was no time pressure.  Dinner proceeded through the courses at our pace.",0
38,38,"We took a little time before we order because we were involved in our business meeting.  Unbeknownst to me this irritated our waiter. Then when we did order the food never came.  I ordered a club sandwich nothing difficult nothing shouldâve taken too much time but our waiter apparently prioritized all his other customers before ours and 45 minutes later still no food.  Then I got a call for a family emergency so I had to leave and of course I couldnât find our waiter for the next five minutes. But when you have to go five minutes seems like an eternity. Finally I tracked him down at another table to tell him that I am leaving and to cancel my order.  The Waiter looked at me very angrily and said what are you talking about.  I said itâs been 45 minutes since I ordered and now I have to go so cancel my order.  Then this waiter got all upset and started arguing with me saying that we took too long to order.  I told him Iâm not gonna argue with you Iâm leaving and I left. By the way, I made a reservation through open table at 5:30 but wasnât seated till 5:45, get this, because the waiter wasnât ready.  Probably the worst experience Iâve ever had at a fancy restaurant .",0
39,39,"We have been coming to the Dal Rae for twenty years. We went 6/25/18 for our wedding anniversary with a party of 5 at 6:30pm. Our server Monica was very flustered and difficult to understand. When our salads came out to be prepped at the same time as the table next to us, she actually asked if she could give us their salad dressing because she accidentally put egg in it-instead if making us a fresh salad. Then she proceeded to give us the incorrect salad order for myself and my husband. The garlic cheese bread that we usually love was hard and chewy and cold. Monica was very confused by our entree orders and had to come back twice to verify specifics. When the entrees arrived, my motherâs salmon was over cooked and cold. My fatherâs ribeye, which he orders every time we come, was unseasoned and disappointing. My husbandâs prime rib was so undercooked and rare (he ordered medium-well, he could not eat it and had to send it back. It took 15 minutes for Monica to bring it back. My crab legs were fine, but the side of creamed corn I ordered came out significantly later than my crab. We were so excited to spend our anniversary at the Dal Rae. We left feeling like everything was an issue and that we were not important guests. There was a table next to us that a Congressman who was sitting at it and it seemed as if they were getting extra special attention and we were ignored. Sadly, we will not be going back to the Dal. It was a very expensive dinner that was average at best.",0
40,40,I hated the chicken picatta it was super sour acid,0
41,41,"Very disappointed! Had a 8:30 p.m. reservation, but we got there @ 7:00 p.m. And got some drinks at the bar(Caddilac Margueritas, and fine wine.)  Checked in @ 8:20 p.m. was Sat a little later.  From there on everything went sour.  First they didn't ask if we had any preference where we would like to sit (we would of stood at the bar to wait to be seated  at our preference) they took us straight to the outside where there was no music, then it started to get worse, it took 1/2hr. (Literally) to get any drinks. Plus to make things worse we didn't get our food till 9:40p.m. if I knew the food was going to take this long, my wife and I would have not ordered The Ribeye and Lobster.  Then they bring the bill. $460.00 dollars + tip($500.00 bill). I went to Dal Rae for high end service. The only thing I received that night was high end, was a high end check.",0
42,42,"I have heard so much about this place but have never been.  So I made early dinner reservations on Valentineâs Day.  My personal opinion is that it is way overrated.  My wife and I have been to many nice restaurants, but this isnât one of them.  Place is rather worn down but has a rather snobby attitude about it.  Waitress had no knowledge of the wines they offered.  I ordered the filet mignon peppersteak which they are supposed to be famous for, medium rare.  My wife ordered the ribeye cooked medium.  My filet came out medium well and hers came out medium rare.  We informed the waitress, and all she said was âdid you like it?  Iâll make sure and tell the kitchenâ.  That was it, no attempt to make it right in any way.  Iâm not one to make a scene or ask for management to come talk to me, so we just left, $320+ dinner for 2 disappointment .  Never will return.  We enjoyed our bottle of Barolo, but that was about it.",0
43,43,"We live in Orange County, but the Dal Rae is our favorite restaurant. It has been for 25 years. There food is the best. Bar none.",1
44,44,"We have been going to Dal Rae for over forty years during the Holidays, but this year the service was extremely disappointing (2o minutes to get a menu for our group) and some of the food was not up to the usual fine quality!",0
45,45,"I am a frequent customer to Dal Rae but I can tell you that If this were my first time, I'd NEVER go Back. The service was Terrible, The Server was Terrible and the food was not as I ordered it. VERY DISAPPOINTING. The server actually seemed upset when I sent the food back. As I mentioned I am a Regular at Dal Rae and I'm sure ill be back but I can honestly say This visit was the Worst Experience was THE WORST. I've had better at Denny's. I don't know waiters name or I'd put him on blast but I do know if I ever get him again I'll quickly asked to be moved from his section. Not what I expect from Dal Rae",0
46,46,"I had planned for a dinner at Dal Rae with my spouse with a reservations for 5:00 pm. I arrived on time expecting to be seated shortly as the hostess indicated that it would be a few minutes to be seated. As I stepped away from the podium another customer approached the hostess and was clearly upset that they had arrived 15 minutes early for their 5:00 pm reservations and had to wait an additional 15 minutes for a table. The hostess replied that the restaurant had seated 150 people at 4:00pm and there would be a wait and she could not provide an estimated time when she could seat them. As time elapsed approximately 40 minutes after we arrived, we inquired about the status of our reservation and were told that our table was still not ready and there were still another 3 couples ahead of us. This was too much for me and we left the restaurant. I do not understand the point of making the reservation at this restaurant if they do not intended on honoring the reservation. When I make a reservation and arrive on time for it, I expected not to wait an unreasonable period of time as this restaurant did. I am positive that if I had been late equal to the amount of time we waited, the restaurant would not have kept our reservation open. There is no excuse for the restaurantâs management to make a customer wait for their reservation due to the restaurants lack of forethought for seating 150 guests at one time and how it would affect the customers later in the evening. There are plenty of good restaurants in the area that will keep their reservations. To add insult to injury the restaurant reported to Open table that we were a no show. The restaurant lost a valuable customer over this issue.",0
47,47,"I was dissapointed for the price way too expensive. I spent  $130.00 for lunch 2 chicken lunches and the drinks were almost  $20 each. Nothing special.about this place. 
I could have gone to Ruth Christ and had a wonderful lunch for less money. I would not recommend  this place  to anybody. Go to Roys , or The Palm , Flemings ,Mastros the chicken was like having Kentucky fried chicken . Thumbs downð",1
48,48,"My family was highly disappointed ..  seated in patio when we asked the female manager to be seated indoors we were told there was no tables available.  So we left , as we exited there were quite a few tables available !!  Then the valet drove my Bmw (white) to the front door and stated he did not have my key ( how did he get the car to start ??). My husband stated I gave you the key when you gave me the ticket .. your valet stated "" don't lie you didn't give me the key these cars don't need a key to drive "".  My son then asked the gentleman can you please check your pockets which he did and there was the key. He inferred my husband was a liar. Not cool or professional  ..  this is my review which was also yelped.",0
49,49,"I have been going to dal Rae since 1970 and I have never seen go downhill so fast
Service was terrible.We had to help ourselves for our wines.We went at 8.30 and dinner was served at 11.The Maine lobster which was the signature dish has been replaced with Australian lobster.My bill was 1200 dols and it was money wasted.Unfortunately this will be my last visit",0
50,50,"Server left us unattended for over 30 minutes. Food was ugly and over priced for a run downed establishment. Did not like it before thought I'd give it another shot, still wasn't any good.",0
51,51,Always outstanding!  One of the finest restaurants in southern California.,1
52,52,"We had high hopes given other reviews. We were hoping this would be a new favorite/ regular place for us - but it was a disaster from the start. We had an 8:00 reservation, but wasn't seated until 8:30. That is ok, availability is dependent upon patrons generally- but after we were seated and it took 10 minutes to see our waiter, we suspected something was up. The waiter came and took our drink order, and we also ordered the artichoke crab appetizer. 10 minutes later, the waiter returns with our drinks (he didn't know what a dark and stormy was, I had to explain it, and what he brought had light rum not spiced dark rum and was $14),  and told us the specials and asked if we wanted to order an appetizer. Another red flag. We reminded him we ordered the appetizer when we ordered drinks. He hadn't put it in. He apologized and went and put it in. We didn't see our waiter again for 15 minutes (dinner order not yet taken) and he asks what we want for our main dish. We order, including a side. 10 more minutes pass and the appetizer arrives (finally) and the dish is mediocre and not overly hot given it must have sat a while. 25 more minutes pass, and our meals arrive - minus the side we ordered. After putting our dishes down he asks if he can do anything else. I ask about the side, which he obviously forgot, and he says it was up and he would go get it (note a small side of mushrooms and his tray was 45% empty). Out of frustration at the poor service my wife cancelled the side, the waiter was confused and kept pushing that he will bring it, and she insisted that he cancel it. He goes away, comes back with the mushrooms muttering (I'm not kidding) that he doesn't want them to go to waste and he will take it off the bill. All of that for mushrooms that were unremarkable at best. We never saw the waiter again - another waiter in the area was available for getting us boxes and eventually the bill. The steak was good, the cold bread and frozen slab of butter, was not good.",0
53,53,Didn't have a chance to eat. I drove 2 hours to the resturant just to find out it was closed. Honestly it would have been nice to know prior to the drive.,1
54,54,Not recommended  for Valentine's day any other day yes but valentine's day only about 10 dishes to choose from  and they set the price and the amount of food  is a combination  80.00 per person when I don't want to eat the rest of the food and can't  buy just the main dish.  And I can't get the plate I like because is not on the menu that day???? Not good for Valentine's day....ask before received.,0
55,55,"Most of the staff was rude and not willing to help you(actually the lady working valet was really nice)but the rest of the staff made you feel as if they are doing you the biggest favor.  The hostess had the worse attitude. They took us 40 minutes after my reservation time and she was they one giving me attitude.... I was sorry for asking for the pager she had just asked me to come back for since there was none available when I checked in... it just seemed like they way over booked. Then the food... the table side Caeser salad was probably the best I've ever had but it was ruined by the fact that one, we didn't get the table side service they just brought us the plate of salad and two, the waitress was pretty much bothered that we were breathing the same air. I also got the chateubriand for two. So would I come back...nope. I feel cheated. It's not cheap to come here and I feel as if this restaurant cheated me from what was supposed to be my 25th birthday dinner. They food was good but not good enough for me to deal with the big personalities they have working for them. Seriously that hostess is so incredibly rude.",0
56,56,"Service was poor. The host pointed to our table but did not seat us. People kept bumping into our table while walking passed due to a large party seated near us. Food lacked seasoning and meat was overcooked. Out of some steaks. We were looking forward to a fine dining experience, however we were underwhelmed. Not worth the trip.",0
57,57,"Normally a favorite place for special occasions- we come several times a year and usually bring family. Tonight the banquet manager evidently thought having a group of cigar aficionados was OK if they were on an adjoining patio. Every time the door opened- which was frequent on a Friday night, the smell of cigar smoke washed over our anniversary dinner.  I am so disappointed that our special night out smelled like the bottom of an ashtray.",0
58,58,"We waited 20 minutes just to get our bread and Our food took over an hour.  Prime rib, roasted rack of lamb and even rice pilaf came in luke warm. Waiter never apologized.  We have to tell the waiter three times to get a birthday cake for our friend.  Awful service.",0
59,59,Great food and service...Heidi is the best server.,1
60,60,"From the moment we walked in it was a bad experience. The hostess didn't say hello, she said what can we do for you, in a tone that didn't make us feel welcomed.  when we informed we had reservations she warmed up a little.  This place is old and tired and everyone had the energy of not caring from top to bottom.  The service was horrible, was not given a wine list, so I asked our server for a glass of pinot noir, she dropped it off never explaining anything about the vintage or brand, still don't know what I drank, later was served prime rib with no Au Jus sauce, the food was mediocre, and it just seemed liked nobody cared, complete waste of $200, will not go back",0
61,61,"Usually love the Del Rae, unfortunately on this visit it took 2 hours from ordering to get our food. Being New Years, we were not served our food til after midnight",1
62,62,"We had a terrible experience. First we got there few minutes before our reservation and we were sitting down on the outside waiting area and one of the guys from the restaurant came and took our chairs because he said they  needed them. Did not offered to sit and wait somewhere else or apologized. After, we got  seated way after our reservation time (25 mins or so) We had to ask the waiter for the food menus as she had forgotten to bring them to us. We ordered our food and boy that took a long time, if you are hungry this isn't the place to visit. It took them over an hour after we order our meals before they can serve us. By this time we were frustrated and ready to go, can't say I'll recommend or ever be going back. For the price of the meals  you are better off treating your self to a nice dinner in an elegant place in Beverly Hills. This place was not organized when it came to attending people from the minute you arrive to the minute you are served. I don't paying high prices for my meals, but one thing i can't stand is poor service. Seems like they have frequent visitors that get better service, as long as they are not new faces. I would not recommend this place at all.",0
63,63,Was seated at a table with another couple just because I asked for an earlier reservation.  I was so hungry I just dealt with it.  But unexceptable for the price we paid for the food. Hostess was rude and so was the waiter.,1
64,64,"We were very disappointed. We were here a couple months ago and thought the poor food and service was a fluke. Now a second time of the same. Overcooked calamari, veal chop half fat literally,  server completely distracted and forgetful. Been coming here for 40 years since I was a kid. We won't be back.",0
65,65,"the seafood is excellent at Dal Rae; try the sea bass or halibut, outstanding.  My dining companion loves the ahi tuna appetizer and pepper steak.  I don't think I've ever regretted anything I've ordered at Dal Rae!",0
66,66,"Reviews are good...3 days later we still cannot figure out why. Morton's prices but Waffle House quality. Nice server, but not experienced and professional.

Food was unbelievably not good. Salads with marinara sauce as dressing? Appetizer list was caviar, then teriyaki beef tips? Sandwiches, veal schnitzel, spaghetti, steaks...besides being all over the place the food was yucky. Lobster smelled fishy and tasted of cinnamon, even though we were told there was no cinnamon used in the dish. Filet had an old off taste, no one could finish our food.

Summary: not a positive thing to say about this place, steer clear.",0
67,67,Have been going to the Dal Rae for years. However last night had to be the worst. Had a 6:00 p.m. reservation and had to wait until 7:00 p.m. to be seated. Place was crowded and staff kept making excuses the it was so busy due to a Dine in L.A. evening. Food and presentation was very poor. Waitress kept apologizing for the long wait. Not a good night.,0
68,68,The manager called my at 9:00 of the night of our 9:30 reservation to tell us we better be on time as it was a holiday weekend and the chefs were tired and leaving at 9:30. Needless to say customer service is not their pimary goal.,0
69,69,"got there 10min early and still waited for 25min and there was a family that didn't have a reservation, he was told an hour wait but was sitted right behind us, the took there order first and drinks. when the took our order they didn't told us about not having prime rib. the other table got their order and we still waited, finally told us that they were out of prime rib we the waited for another hour before it was the worst service we ever got.",1
70,70,"I was very disappointed in my last visit to Dal Rae. Not only were they out of the entree that I specifically went there for, the service was horrible! it took forever just to get a drink and even longer to get my bill taken care of. I probably won't be going again unless someone gives me a gift card.",0
71,71,"will never go again. Steak tar tar shoved on a plate like a raw hamburger patty they forgot to mold, or add spices to or even realize how it should be served.",1
72,72,"Been going to Dal Rae for many years. Had the WORST meals on this visit. Double pork chop dry; steak Diane not made the same way Loren or the other Matre D's make it. Took 30 minutes to get a cocktail and had to ask for our menus. This was not the typical experience for Dal Rae. Must have something to do with the holidays? You can usually count on a great dining experience here (great food, excellent service and nice atmosphere) - we were extremely disappointed we did not get that during this visit.",0
73,73,"I will never go back there again during the holidays, my visit was 12/23/2010 7PM, we were packed in like sardines in a can, the waitress was not hearing half of what I had sppken to her and the food was not to the high standard of which normally Del Rae's serves. Not to forget to mention the 45 minute wait for our dinner. For the evening it was high priced and the service and the food were a slight bit better then Sizzler, though Sizzler would have been less nosiy and crowded..",1
74,74,"Although we have dined numerous times at the Dal Rae, we walked out of the restaurant on Saturday December 19 without eating. We had a reservation and waited 25 minutes for a table. During the 25 minute wait, we sat in the bar area and were never approached by a server. We were seated and then waited a long time for a waiter/waitress to say hello. The restaurant was packed to the rafters with holiday revelers and it appeared they had oversold the place for the evening. It was loud and freezing cold under the blasting air-conditioning. The tables had been so tightly packed there could not have been a way for the crowd to legally exit the establishment if needed. The waiters certainly could not properly service the tables...",0
75,75,"We had terrible service and wrote a note on the bill, hope they read it.  We were there Sunday night 4/20/08 8PM.  This is an expensive restaurant and for the service we got we will not be coming back again.  Our waitress was terrible!!!  I hope the owner reads this.",1
76,76,"Didn't get a warm fuzzy from the hostess.  Must have had a bad day.  Then a server dropped a glass cocktail in the front lobby where everyone was standing.  Red drink got on three people's clothing but no apology from anybody from the restaurant.  We choose not to make scene but details like that make it extremely doubtful we will ever come back.  The food was just ok.  Saltiness does not equate to flavor.  Lettuce wedge salad was abominable, dressing tasted like mayonnaise and not blue cheese.  We thought this was going to be Great  dinner.  The four of us were wrong.",0
77,77,"While I understand that restaurants canât control how long patrons stay at their tables, we were extremely disappointed that we had to wait 45 minutes for a table even though we had a reservation. Then it took at least another 10 minutes before anyone paid attention to us at our table. The only saving grace to this night out was our server, Cari/Carrie. She was delightful and engaging, but we could tell she was spread thin. There were not enough servers, and the food wasnât as good as itâs been other times.",0
78,78,"We reserved last minute availabilty for Outdoor dinning,  but literally was an outdoor seating (canopy covered parking) .... we were expecting outdoor Patio...., :(  anyway, we decided to stay, dine and take over after that for a valentine  party, ,It was very windy night and the canopy cover flew over, it was funny,  everybody ran and abandoned the space like when Titanic was sinking. :)",1
79,79,"Scalloped potatoes were luke warm. Hostess refused to let us sit in a booth even though there were booths that didn't have anyone in them.   There was a prixe fixe menu even though there was no notice of that when I made reservations.  Our table was in the middle of the room and my chair kept being bumped by wait staff, hostess, bus persons.  I have always liked this restaurant, but this experience has made me not want to return.  I regretted not choosing somewhere else for our date night.",0
80,80,Everything was fine with the exception of the hostess. The older blonde hostess was rude and very condescending. I have been coming here for decades and never been treating like this.,0
81,81,"Timing of entree was poorly timed.
Took two hours to get meals.",0
82,82,"We came to Dal Rae for my fatherâs birthday celebration. We brought him here last year and had a great time. This time we invited other family members and made a reservation several weeks in advance, but it was disappointing. We were seated at a round table in the main dining room rather than a booth we had requested. My brotherâs seat was wet - they wiped it down but we realized after there was a leak from the vent above dripping down on his arm. The owner wouldnât move us to a corner booth because someone more important had requested it and instead he had the table scooted over a few feet so I was then smashed up to the people at the next table. They were unhappy about it as well.

The waitress was nice, but clueless. We had to keep asking for her to take our drink order and then it still took forever for them to come. We ordered a Caesar salad, which a man came and made - it tasted good until I found several slimy blobs and I immediately stopped eating it. After that we waited about 45 mins for our food and wine. We wanted to enjoy our time and not rush, but it got awkward after awhile. The waitress said she called for our food to be picked up, which arrived and then sat on the serving trays next to us waiting for her to come pass it out. A few items were wrong and my husbandâs steak was cold, but whatever. We let it go because they were busy.

After the meal, they brought my dad dessert and we sang happy birthday. The check came, we paid over $600 and as we were finishing up our conversation, a man in a checkered coat came and told us they needed the table and we had to leave. Seriously? We were patient the whole time with the table issues, the inept waitress, the super slow service and they had the nerve to be so rude? Wow. On the way out we told the hostess about it who said it wasnât her fault. We told her to let the owner know and that we wonât be back. They have their regulars and donât care, but it sucks to have one less place to go for fine dining.",0
83,83,"Very slow, Approx 1 hr to receive food.$38 sea food salad was marginal at best. Been there years ago, MUCH better then.",0
84,84,Hated it. Clientele is tacky and loud. Couldnât leave fast enough. The food was barely passable. Never again.,1
85,85,"Very disappointed with this visit.  We understand the Xmas busyness, however, the restaurant has been in business for a very long time and should know how to manage its reservations.  Maybe they should enforce a two hour table limit (like other restaurants).  Our reservation was for 8:00 pm, which we checked in at 5-10 mins before.  We werenât seated until 9:00 pm.  Our drinks werenât served until 9:30 and our appetizers were served at 9:50.  Our dinner was served at 10:40 pm and while our flat iron steaks were ordered medium rare they were were served rare.  Since we got our meal so late, we didnât complain about the meat being served rare as we just wanted to eat.  Weâve dined here before and always had a great meal/service.  We have made note to never come during the Holidays as the staff canât handle/manage reservations.  We didnât leave the restaurant until 11:20 pm.",0
86,86,"Restaurant very noisy and the lighting poor.  It was difficult to see the menu. Ordered fish and it was not prep the way it was described and the asparagus spears were cold.   It appeared our waiter had too many people to attend too.   Needed help.   The margarita did not taste like it had tequila, bland.   I wonât go back.   Too much, poor food prep, noisy, poor lighting.    First time and I was disappointed â¹ï¸",0
87,87,Iâve been to this restaurant before itâs great but this last service was not good I waitress basically wanted us to leave and hurry up,0
88,88,"Food is over-hyped and over-priced. Nothing special at all. Service was great though. That being said, Iâve had a better experience at Black Angus.",1
89,89,"I have always enjoyed the Del Rae. However, I canât say that about tonightâs dining experience. 
We were seated in annex room. No ambiance whatsoever.  Service was just ok. 
When the MaÃ®tre d'  came to ask us how we  were linking our experience, we told him our disappointment regarding where we were sitting. He could care less. At smugly replied âwell, we have many reservations.â 
I guess we got the short end of the stick. 
All we said is that we should have been given the option to be seated in the annex room or wait for a table. 
We would have chose the latter. 
Major disappointment. We paid over $100  per persi. To be seated in a cold, unattractive   room with mediocre service.  
We Wonât be rushing  back here 
Thank goodness the company made up for what the Del Rae Restaurant was lacking.",0
90,90,The greeter was rude and the service was slow.  When the food came the fries were cold.  I love this place and have been bringing clients here for years.  I was embarrassed.  Not good.  Normally so great.  This time terrible.,0
91,91,I booked to just go out to dinner and they forced up to order from a valentines menu which was WAY OVER PRICED!!! We also wanted to order our favorite cottage potatoes and they told us they couldn't make them. When I booked the reservation I was never told any if this. So for that I am very disappointed!!!!!,1
92,92,We were rushed and pushed to order when i was specific with my reservation for a birthday,0
93,93,Great food. Disappointed with the service this time. For a special day it was a disappointment.,1
94,94,"Although service by Dawn was good, salad was not fresh and salmon & mashed potatoes were very cold. The bread was not fresh and hard! Also, why is there valet during lunch? Was not expecting this. Finally, I was surprised your Dine LA menu did not include dessert, unlike all the other restaurants Iâve visited since last week. And, no lattes. Very disappointing.",0
95,95,"Food just very poor, onion soup- too watery, cheese was plastic-y, crab stuffed mushroom - just didnât taste good. Steak was okay, seemed more like mincemeat, chicken parmsesan bland",1
96,96,"Our waiter messed up our order  after waiting about an hour and a half. She forgot that my wife and I were gluten intolerant. 2nd dish came out and it was completely rare, not medium rare.",0
97,97,"Made a reservation, multiple people had a reservation at 8pm. However my husband and I were seated until an hour later. People who had similar reservations and arrived after us where seated first as well.",0
98,98,I've eaten there before. but this time the food was subpar and the service was slow,1
99,99,"My first time visiting Del Raeâs and despite my reservation we had to wait to be seated. Once we were offered a table
It wasnât in the main dining room. I had to request to sit inside, which if you are looking for ambiance, I recommend it over the exterior seating. The waitress was friendly, but telling me about her plans to visit the restaurant tomorrow night. (Truly none of my business) but, whatever. My mom
is super lite eater so, we agreed to share our meal which honestly we could have easily ordered the steak and fish separately and shared for less than what it cost us to split. The waitress never explained the fee for splitting, hence my reasoning for giving Del Raeâs a poor rating. Itâs sad that this was my excuse because I have waited years to enjoy what I thought would be a great experience. #disappointed",0
100,100,Was there for a total of 3 hours waiter took  about 20 min to come to table had someone else start us off with water after about 45 min friend was able to get a cocktail and after an hour and a half they brought out the dinner which I was really annoyed by that time since it had taken almost an hour just to order we ate fast and left as we both werenât pleased any more we honestly debated on just getting up and leaving poor service and food was not the greatest definitely over priced,0
101,101,"...Seated outside in a corner parking lot patio despite reservation request for inside seating. There was a back and forth about the reservation seating for a few minutes before accepting beating seating outside. Shortly after being seated, we (family of 4) realized we needed to retrieve jackets from valet because of the cold breeze. Upon getting jackets , host Mentioned some seats âopened up.â We were reseated in the banquet room by kitchen door. Waitress noticed our wobbly table which she said the âbus boyâ would fix. A gentleman tried fixing it for 5-10 minutes to then say, that thatâs the best he could doâ which we understood given the amount of time he spent. I ordered old fashioned cocktails  that were watered down and didnât taste good. My steak was okay . I took half home to try to âdoctorâ it up to no avail. Oh, I forgot to mention that our though reservation was at 530pm, we didnât get our dinner until 720pm. Without mentioning anything about the delay in eating, the waitress had mentioned her apologies for the food taking so long. Still gave a 21% tip. Tried to introduce my children to this place as we typically enjoy dining here but this time was pretty bad - especially considering the money and time spent.",0
102,102,"Reservation was made a while ago and was seated at the far corner of outdoor tent despite requesting for inside seating as we are dining with my in laws who are older and would like closer access to the restroom. Service was not great. Our food arrived TWO HOURS after we were seated. Table side Caesar salad was no longer made table-side though they still charge table-side pricing and the taste and flavor was not even close to what we remembered it to be. Overall, $400 later we didnât walk out happy, not with the service, food and ambiance that we experienced. Definitely will not be coming back to the establishment anymore.",0
103,103,Just not the same anymore. Everything was lacking from the service to the food& drink quality. So sad this has been a long time favorite.,1
104,104,This isn't the Dal Rae it used to be. The meat taste like SYSCO is suppling it. The topping for the famous peppered steak was drowning in oil. The service was sketchy to non-existent yet pleasant when it came around. The bathrooms are dirty. This once was a high end steakhouse I used to bring customers and guests to weekly.,0
105,105,"The table was too small, the service was not what I am used to.  The relish tray was not abundant like usual snd when we asked for more pickles we got 2 when there was 4 of us. Our garlic bread came out with the appetizer and then 25 min later our Caesar salads showed up. 
It was a birthday and not everyone was at the table when the waiter brought a piece of cake out so I donât believe he read the room (table) well. Then came back 20 min later to see what we wanted for dessert . Cappuccino machine broke etc....not our usual exceptional experience to say the least.",0
106,106,"very expensive for what you get.  Outside patio is ok.  I guess maybe if the waiter was more attentive, then our overall experience would have been better and i wouldnt be bothered by the expensiveness of the food.  I ordered filet medallions and received 3 tiny slices of meat.
We ordered shrimp cocktail and the shrimp was dry.  again very expensive for 3 dry prawns.
not the same, maybe its due to Covid.
I wont be going back anytime soon.",1
107,107,To many people. No social distancing. The decor was poor. Hope you open the main dining room soon.,1
108,108,"I donât get the point in reserving a table at 8 when we didnât get seated until 9pm. Then, my husbands steak was very oily, inedible. Awful. Never again.",0
109,109,"I would give it another chance.  Service slow, 2 in my party and both orders were mixed up, food was warm not hot.  Food was tasty, but again warm.",0
110,110,"This is my favorite restaurant hands down, but this dinner fell way short of what Iâm come to expect. The corner table in the back room felt isolated, the service was not good and the steak was chewy.",0
111,111,"This was probably the worst experience we have ever had at the restaurant. After we were seated the waiter came and never introduced himself, we had to ask. 
It was my wife's birthday.and I had put it in my reservation. We weren't asked if it some special occasion. The waiter should know from the reservation what the occasion was and acted appropriately.
The other thing that was very annoying was the lack of dress code in a high-end restraunt. There were men in t-shorts and shorts in the dining room. Very low class.",0
112,112,"My friend and I frequently meet here because it's between our two homes, usually we have a good experience, but this time it was my friends birthday, and I was very disappointed.  I had made the reservation far in advance and requested main dining room on Open Table-- said it was for a birthday. I called at 4PM and reiterated it was a birthday confirming main dinning room seating as requested. The woman who answered was very rude and was basically like, yeah if we can, but she made it very clear she or the restaurant weren't going to make any effort here.  This was for a 5:30 rez.  The service was mediocre; open table Caesar sat and sat because the waitress couldn't find time to make it, we had empty wine glasses at the start of the meal, a birthday desert came as we were paying.  ....As always we ring up a big bill here, and this was no exception; we order lots of wine, desert, aps/ salad, of course main course, etc....I've known this friend for 20 years so it's not the end of the world, but will probably never do a special occasion here again. For the prices they charge a cattle car approach on a special occasion is unacceptable.",0
113,113,It would have been a perfect anniversary dinner for me and my wife except they put us in a share table with a partition. Wasnât expecting that at a fine dinning place. A booth for 2 or a table for 2 would have been nice. Very disappointing.,0
114,114,"Had a 9 pm reservation. They were busy, but we were attended to pretty quickly. We were not provided drink menus and had to wait a few minutes for those to arrive. The drinks were slow to arrive (almost 10 min). We ordered the Caesar salad, which was prepared table side. It was good. Bread at table was worse than grocery store deli bread and not warm. We waited 30 min after we finished the salad for entrees to come. Really? By this time, the restaurant was mostly empty, so I donât understand what took so long. I ordered the cheeseburger. It was dry and had no flavor. The side of asparagus was over cooked and very stringy. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm. It was average. Very average. In fact, Olive Garden is ten times better. Pretty disappointing for a $125 dinner.",0
115,115,"Escargot with extra garlic was spot on, as was the cheese bread.

Drinks were well mixed, but overpriced overpriced.
Duck a la 'range  was tasteless and salty wild rice.

No acknowledgement of birthday.

Experience was highly disappointed!!",0
116,116,"This has always been our âgo-toâ for our group of 6 friends to celebrate birthdays.  Weâve been disappointed the last 2 times weâve been there for a number or reasons.  Weâve been seated at tables in what I call âthe aisleâ.   Doesnât allow enough room for servers or guests to move by freely, elbows get bumped etc.  Noise level really high.   Relish dishes have gotten skimpier.  Finally our waitress seemed stressed or possibly new?  We typically avoid weekends- last two times have been a Tuesday night.
Definitely a disappointment.",0
117,117,"Way too crowded. The tables were smashed so close together, the waiters had to squish through and hang over our table to get through. The noise level was high. We couldnât even talk.",0
118,118,For the price that you are paying the food was just ok,1
119,119,Waited over an hour for a reservation.,0
120,120,Felt discriminated cuz I was Hispanic. Had reservation and still waited for another hour to be seated. They said come back later for a pager cuz they had none available when after they were telling others to come back in 15 min for a pager. Asked for a booth and they gave me a table. Bad experience for it being a special dinner date.,1
121,121,Service was incredibly slow. We were bragging about this restaurant to our 6 friends that had never been there. We were very disappointed. I usually love this place but not that night. I had to go get my own cocktail and then my steak was way undercooked. They did take it off the bill. I know itâs the holidays but if you donât have enough help they shouldnât book that many guests,1
122,122,Lobster tail seemed frozen.  King crab legs not so good.  The Dal Rae chopped salad not good like it use to be.  Remodel is great.  Service very good.  Food needs to reach the top level as it has always been.  I hope to give it another try.  Thank you.  I have been going to the Dal Rae since about 1972.,1
123,123,Why bother with an OpenTable reservation when we were seat 45 minutes late?,1
124,124,The lobster tail was very dry and not appealing. Service was good. Cesar salad was good.,0
125,125,We waited for 20 minutes at our table before anyone noticed us. After that service was good.,1
126,126,"My wife and I had been to Dal Raeâs twice before our most recent visit. Weâve always had a really nice experience, great food, great service and good drinks! This last time we invited 6 friends to join us but we did not have a very good experience. Our food took more than an hour to come out, we were seated and it took probably 15 minutes before our drink orders were taken, our drink glasses were empty and we had to flag down the waitress to get another drink. My friends and I definitely expected much better service for the price. We were served bread two or three times because the food was taking so long. Our steaks were way undercooked, I order medium and it was more like rare.  I will try Dal Raeâs again because my first two visits were good but I know my friends will probably not return as they got a bad first impression of the restaurant.",0
127,127,Too busy! Waiter was behind several orders. Forgot to put in our appetizers and would not see him for 15 to 20 increments.,0
128,128,"Made reservations for my fiancÃ©âs birthday, even reminded hostess and no one mentioned her birthday or brought cake. The tables were packed to the maximum. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed and rushed. Very disappointing.",0
129,129,Hubby and I first time there for our anniversary is was okay. My hubby was not feel to good after we got home from restaurant. He was in and out of restroom x4 times,1
130,130,"Weâve been here before. Our experience in the past has been pleasurable. This time, we left unimpressed. Our main server, Ashley, was horrible. We had to ask for a drink menu twice before getting one. She rarely checked on our table, but was at a nearby table constantly. The gentlemen that was bringing our dishes out was more attentive to us, basically doing Ashleyâs job. Had I brought cash, I would have directed the complete tip to him. If we do dine here again, I will specifically ask not to be seated in Ashleyâs section. On a previous occasion, Eileen was our server, who made our experience most enjoyable. Because of Ashleyâs inefficiencies, our meal was not as great as we would have expected.",0
131,131,This was our seventh visit all on holidays. All were wonderful. This time made an 'Open Table' reservation a month ahead. Got there on time an annexed to a noisy side dinning area. No ambiance. Service was mediocre. Rushed. Dessert delivered while still eating main course. Was this because I booked on Open Table ? I have always in the past booked directly with the restaurant.,1
132,132,I have been to the Dal Rae many times and the food and service were top notch. It has been in the main dining  area with less than 5 guests. This time it was a group of 8. We were put in the back room with poor service and poor food quality. I messaged the restaurant and did not receive a response. I would not recommend sitting anywhere other than the main dining room.,0
133,133,"Our server was good.  I've been to Dal Rae for the past 5 years (my husband proposed to me at Dal Rae) and every time, I've enjoyed my meal, except for this last time.  It was my first time bringing my parents there so I was hoping they would experience the same level of satisfaction as I did.  However, this was different.  We were placed next to the fountain, in an ""extended"" room.  I was expecting to be seated inside the restaurant.  It was hot/humid and it took a while for us to get our water.  Additionally, there were flies!  A fly landed on my mom's lamb and she didn't want to deal with the hassle of sending the food back, so she scooped off the peas.  The filet was also extremely spicy, too much pepper and the bread was as hard as a rock.  A huge disappointment.  Needless to say, I will not be celebrating my birthday or anniversary at Dal Rae anymore.",0
134,134,"You basically pay for a large serving of meat/poultry/fish,  veggie sides are very small. (3 florets of broccoli or 3 asparagus sprigs) your best bet is a backed potato. Mash potatoes does not come with gravy.  Disappointed, but it was an experience.",0
135,135,"I have been coming to Dal Rae for 20 years. When we received the garlic cheese bread it had no garlic. Waitress said all the bread was like that. I got lamb chops and had to put salt on them. Very disappointed in both. The escargot was great as usual.
We won't be hurrying back.",0

137,137,"I've come here with my family since I was a kid. I decided to bring my mom out to dinner and the service was awful.  We had Mireille who did not seem to care much for us. It took 15 minutes before she even came by and greeted us. She consistently kept forgetting items (soups, place settings, and my wine took 30 min). I'm honestly insulted with the poor level of service. I'm here quite a bit (2-4 times per month) to entertain customers but I do not think I will be returning. Food is still excellent but the service was embarrassing.",0
138,138,Very disappointed.  Been going to Dal Rae for years.  Quality of food - average.  Not worth the drive or expense.  Will not be going back.,1
139,139,"Dined at Dal Rae for a birthday dinner for my mom. My grandma and I made a reservation for Friday evening. The minute we paid the bill we were asked to leave by the manager.  The manager stated they were very busy and needed our table. We were very upset as we still had dessert on the table and coffee in our mugs. There were others dining around us that were also finished eating and were not asked to leave. For a fine dining establishment, we did not feel that the service was top notch. We definitely will not be going back there anytime soon.",0
140,140,"I have loved Dal Rae for years!  I've been here for many Christmas parties, Drug rep events, special occasions and casual dining.  I've been more than satisfied every time.  Last night, was so disappointing.  My best friend and I came here for my birthday (which was stated on our reservation), We were seated, ""no HBD"" acknowledgement.  The waitress had no enthusiasm and acted like she just wanted the day to be over.  My usual order consists of the crab cakes, a ceasar salad and if I'm really hungry the sea bass.  Last night the crab cakes were mushy and the ceasar salad dressing wasn't creamy like it had been in the past.  This time it was very soggy and salty - I didn't even eat half of it.  The waitress vanished so we were not able to tell her about the salad.  My friend had the french onion soup to start and was disappointed that they skimped on the cheese on top of the bowl. The cheese didn't even touch the sides of the bowl.  For dessert we ordered the mini pumpkin pie with the description as ""creamy pumpkin and a shortbread crust.""  The pie we got was a slice of pie which tasted supermarket bought.  It did not have a shortbread crust!!!  The only time the waitress was fast was when she brought us the check and processed the credit card.  Left there feeling underwhelmed and disappointed for the restaurant not acknowledging my birthday.",0
141,141,Crowded (tables too close together) and noisey.  Food ok but over priced.,1
142,142,"Food quality big diff than before. the escargot was way too salty, lumps of salt right on top, lack of buttery flavor, restaurant was just too busy. The raw fish that my daughter ordered was like someone just piled on some greens, no presentation, kinda like a do it yourself salad.  Even though the waitress tried, but she was handling too many tables, busperson the same, owner should hire more workers. It used to be a pleasant experience while dining here, but now it is more like an Olive Garden caliber. Worst, they have a Xmas menu and many items on the regular menu is not avail during the holidays, very sad. Had couple of nice quality meals here before, but not anymore.",0
143,143,"It was a busy Saturday evening.  I get it.  I am not complaining of the 45 minute wait past our reservation time.  We were seated in the back room for events, away from the main dining area.  There was a large sign ""Happy Retirement"" or something of this nature in the room that was eventually taken down.  What I am complaining about is the service.  We ordered appetizers that never arrived.  We were seated at 9:00 p.m. but our prime rib dinners (3) did not get to our table until 10:00 p.m.  We were told that they stagger the food orders to it all does not come at once, thus, the delay.  The problem is that our other food never arrived so there was nothing to stagger.  The table of 4 to our left had their entire meals for free because they were louder than we were about complaints to the manager.  I don't mind paying for the prime rib, but all 3 prime rib dinners were well done when we ordered medium rare.  This wait and terrible excuse was not deserving.  We were paying customers.",0
144,144,"We had reservations for 8:00. They sat us at 9:00. The attitude was ""oh well, it is Saturday"". The four of us are all professionals who dine out multiple days per week. We all agreed the attitude was horrible. In addition, the ambiance we have experienced there in the past is gone. People/table packed in like sardines. Very loud and unpleasant. Sad. Used to love this place.",1
145,145,"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST SERVICE MY WIFE AND I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED IN A FINE DINING RESTAURANT.  ALTHOUGH THE PRIME RIB WAS EXCELLENT, THE SERVER RUINED THE ENTIRE DINING EXPERIENCE FOR US.  WE WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE DAL RAE.",0
146,146,Over priced and very  seating area. The food was good but  overpriced,1
147,147,"Been going to Del Rae's for 16 years to celebrate our anniversary.  For the first time we received poor service. The hostess was abrasive and the waitress was unattentive.  They squeezed a round table next to ours which made the walkway for the waitstaff extremely narrow.  Everyone's ""behind"" rubbed our table as they walked by to the kitchen.  Our cesar salad that we asked to be prepared table side was prepared behind a partition.  

The restaurant was booked to the gills...it was incredibly noisy.  Our waitress had a hard time hearing us...so we just gave up.

My husband only had one cocktail because it was tasteless.  I actually had two martini's because they were very weak.  Not good!

Overall it was a horrible experience that cost us $265.00.  NEVER AGAIN.",0
148,148,"The reason I chose this restaurant is because they have a good duck. However, unknowing to me we were placed in a back room for Valentines Day which included a Valentine's Day menu which for one did no include the duck and which required us to pick a 3 course meal, both. This is something I was not planning on and was surprised about. I wonder if we were to be placed in the regular dining space if we would have had a chance at making our own choice if we wanted a salad or dessert and if they would have served duck. I might go back to satisfy my duck craving but I would not recommend this location for a ""holiday"" weekend without asking if there is a specific menu first. I did not think since we went in on a Friday the 12th that we would be required to order off the set menu.",0
149,149,"We went to the Dal Rae, with probably too high expectations, because it was an extreme let down. The only positive was the service once we were finally seated. The food and ambiance were highly overrated and an extreme disappointment.
We will never return.",1
150,150,"I ordered the ""poor mans steak"" and I was drastically underwhelmed. It was basically a ground beef burger patty shaped like a steak. I figured it's called Poor Mans Steak because it is smaller and not the best cut of meat but I was at least expecting a STEAK. Maybe it's my fault for expecting to get an actual cut of meat, should've done my research. The place is nice though.",0
151,151,"I did tons of research looking for the perfect restaurant to take my brother and his wife to for a treat.  There are many good restaurants to choose from that have good food and good cocktails but I wanted one that  also provided a bit of ole fashioned charm and perhaps a quieter atmosphere than  all the new hipster spots.  I thought the Dal Rae was going to be perfect.  I made a 7:00 reservation 6 weeks in advance.  We arrived at 5 min till 7 and were told there would be a 20 minute wait.  I reminded the disinterested hostess we had reservations and was told ""Everyone has reservations.""  Waited in the bar, standing room only, shouted our order to the bartender who made us a round of great drinks.  We were seated in a large uninspired room at 7:25.  We were greeted by another disinterested staff member who wanted to take our order before we even opened our menus.  The retro vibe is great but the dal Rae has lost it's class.
Food was good, wine selection good, slick bar scene but the overall dining experience was no better than Black Angus, CheezeCake Factory or any other impersonal chain restaurant.",1
152,152,"This was my first time at Dal Rae.  Took my parents for their 56th wedding anniversary.  The food is good but a bit overpriced.  The waiter forgot to order the Roasted Duck for my farther on this special occasion.  After apologies from waiter and manager, they gave us a free desert.  Manager should have given a substantial discount on food bill or a credit for next visit for this unforgiveable error.",0
153,153,"Yelp lead me to this classic eatery. My first interaction was with the valet, who was not very friendly. Cold, actually. Once I entered, I was greeted by dark wood as far as the eye could see. Does this place have windows?  No hostess to greet me. 
Booth was old and uncomfortable, with springs riding into my backside. 
Drinks were fine. Bread basket ok. A random iced dish with veggies (why?). Hot Parmesan bread was good. Appetizers were small and not worth the price, though the taste was ok. 
I was so excited for the famous pepper steak. What a letdown. Not a great cut of filet, and the topping was flavorless. My friend has the veal parm, which was good. 
Dessert was very good. Cheesecake and crime brÃ»lÃ©e. 
All in all, a letdown.",0
154,154,I was not very impressed by the place or the food. Plus you are charged for valet. At most restaurants valet is free if you are dining in.,1
155,155,"From the time my date and I walked in the door it was all down hill! The older lady-hostess was very impolite! The waitress said she forgot our relish tray when I asked why we NEVER received one! My cocktail had a lemon pit in it! My red wine was served in a white wine glass! I had to ask twice for more water when I noticed all other tables had carafes on them! We were served a birthday cake with candle when it was not my girl friends birthday, obviously the wait staff was at the wrong table! On the way out the hostess and women wait staff were gathered around the podium talking about how they wish they were a size 0 and there female medical problems! NOT ONE good night or thank you, or come back and see us, or thanks for coming in, or watch your driving going home! For a restaurant that has been around for decades they better shape up or they will be out of a job-business, especially when a party of two are paying $150.00 for a fine dinning experience! I will never step foot in this JOINT again! Its to bad  because the food was excellent!  Jeff from Las Vegas!",0
156,156,"I decided to have a double date at DineLA because they had a DineLA option and because it has 4 stars on Yelp. Based on the reviews and other's word of mouth, we heard they had the best steak in town. Maybe I'm just too picky of an eater but I wasn't impressed.

We all shared the Hearts of Romaine and Grilled Artichoke. I expected more out of the Hearts of Romaine salad to be more than just a wedge of Romaine Lettuce with a dash of Caesar Dressing. It was too plain. The Grilled Artichoke was just ok. It came with 2 sauces. I got to try the Dae Rae 14oz Filet Mignon at Medium Rare, which was actually more rare than I liked. I will say though, that the peppered crust was really good. That...I was impressed with. As for dessert, we got the New York Cheesecake with Raspberry Syrup. It was a good cheesecake but not the best. The crust was rock solid and hard to eat.

Overall, I think for the price, I'll go somewhere else for steak like Clearman's Steak n' Stein. The ambiance was romantic and the lighting was dim. It is definitely a place for the older crowd. My friends and I were the youngest ones there.",1
157,157,"Del Rae has always been an ""Oldie"" favorite with an excellent dinning menu... but, our evening was not a ""goodie"".. Service was very slow from beginning to end, and the food was not prepared to our request; therefore, had to be returned and corrected... The waitress although very pleasant, seemed to be overwhelmed and couldn't handle all the tables she was assigned... An evening out with friends was not very delightful and we all agreed, we will not be returning!",0
158,158,"Decided to take 2 colleagues to dinner at the dal rae on a saturday night.  made reservations at 8 did not get seated until 915!  unacceptable! the hostess was put off that we inquired when it was 15, 30, minutes past our reserved time.  she responded by saying ""well, we are just seating the 7pm guests!""  service was not great and the food was good.  most likely won't return and i was becoming quite the fan!  oh well......",0
159,159,"They took out all the character in the bar area and remodeled with with a modern flair - no piano player present and we ordered the cesar salad and never even saw it being made by our table - no banana foster or cherries jubilee on the xmas menu - at $90 a person I would have expected more 
disappointed",1
160,160,"The waitress seemed to have an attitude the whole time. We ordered two drinks and both were made way to strong where you onky tasted alchol. We had one steak cooked perfectly but the other was peppered way to much, and that as all you coukd taste.",0
161,161,"The decor, food and everything about this place was still in the 50's.  Overcooked vegetables, stale bread, and Eisenhour's booth still in tact.  Wouldn't go back and sorry I went.",1
162,162,"So disappointed with my first experience at Dal Rae.  Service was rushed, the new york pepper steak was tough and the actual meat was flavorless, the mushrooms tasted weird.  The only item that I thought was good was the bleu cheese wedge salad.  Saddened because I had heard so many great things about this restaurant.  Pricey and I would be ok with it, but not when it tastes worse than the Sizzler.",0
163,163,Come here frequently for dinner & is always a joy. Today's lunch experience was not.  Food is O.K. but they were very crowded. Took well over an hour to get our food. If you have a 2 hour lunch break it's still too long.,1
164,164,"Service was terrible. I was here for 3 hours because the service was so poor. I ordered a bottle of wine and after 30 minutes I still hadn't received it until I asked for it again. They were not apologetic at all about the service which disappointed me even more. The seabass is tasty, and the peppercorn steak is mediocre I think. The food in general is decent, but I am very upset about the service.",0
165,165,"We have dined at Dal Rae for over 25 years. It is our favorite place, the most consistent food and service of any restaurant I've ever dined at. For the first time ever, the service was horrid. Never took a drink order, long delays between visits and generally lousy all the way around.
I truly believe this to be an anomaly and it won't keep us from going there again because everything else was still wonderful. If you only get poor service once every 25 years you don't have much to complain about, but it was still a shock given all the fabulous experiences we've had there.",0
166,166,"I've heard such great things about the Dal Rae. I decided to go for my birthday. I let them know it was my 1st time and bday. Traffic was unexpectedly heavy for a Saturday, so we were running 15 minutes late. I called to let them know that we were still coming. We were seated directly in front of the kitchen door. Great start...The tables were on top of each other. My husband felt like if he scratched his back he'd hit the guy behind him. The food was okay, but nothing special. Hubby had an average steak. The Lobster Thermidor tasted kind of off, hard to describe, just off. My son said the Penne Arrabiata lacked any heat. It wasn't actually bad, just borning. They didn't even wish me a happy birthday. Yeah, I won't be back. Underwhelming.",0
167,167,"The food was very good. The atmosphere felt dense and the server seemed either lethargic or lacked the enthusiasm or interest in serving my friend and I. The manager walked by our table a few times and didn't say anything and just as we were about to leave he came by to greet us. He probably felt obligated to say a word or two. The server appeared to have more interest in serving the party next to us a lot more than my table. So in short, the dining experience was underwhelming to say the least. I still ended up giving the server a very generous tip. I hope the restaurant gets it the next time when I vist, that is, if there is a next time.",0
168,168,"The place is stuck in time. The ceilings are covered with that popcorn stuff and the strange angle of the divided restaurant in the main dining room makes it look like a typical Dennys inside. The food was simply OK. I had the peppered filet, which lacked in taste. The peppered flavoring on top was nice, but the steak itself was just bland. The sides of scalloped potatoes were great. But the service was mediocre. While others were treated to an enthusiastic wait staff, mine was simple there to do a job. No energy at all.",0
169,169,"I had a reservation and still had to wait 15 mins to be seated. The hostess was rude. Sat at the bar and was ignored by the bartender. The food was not what I hoped for. The baked potato was like mush. I ordered a French onion soup and didn't find any onions. The only that was decent was the chocolate dessert. Even was just ok.
I guess I could always say "" I've been there, once"".",1
170,170,"THE SERVICE: We had reservations at 7:30 pm on a Saturday during dineLA week and didn't get seated until half an hour later. Our waitress took a long time to take our order/bring our food and forgot to ask how I wanted my meat cooked. I think that's a pretty horrible mistake to make as a server. Her overall attitude was just not very friendly. However, they did a good job of refilling our water.

THE AMBIANCE: Loud, packed, busy, but probably because it was dineLA. But take away all of the craziness, and it's actually a classy restaurant.

THE FOOD: We got the escargot appetizer but have had better at French restaurants. I got the bone-in ribeye and my boyfriend got the pepper steak New York. We agreed both were good but nothing special.",0
171,171,"I reviewed the menu on line before making reservations. Never did it mention or show a special menu for 12/31. I called to confirm my reservation, again, it was never mention about a special new years eve menu. We arrived, again no mention of special menu. We were seated and given the a special menu in a fancy black folder, it was $100.00 PER PERSON!! We asked the waitress for the regular menu and she said it was just the special menu that day. We were already seated and too embarrassed to get up and leave. Were not rich, but we were aware of your average prices, the dinner we had was not worth $100. I believe the owner was walking around and greeting and asking how everything was, I was going to say something, but my husband said not too.",0
172,172,"The servers promptly gave us our relish trays and water, along with the bread and butter. That is about it for good service! Everything from there went slowly downhill. Our server didn't show up for a while and we had no idea where she went; one of us from the group got up to order his own drink from the bar. Finally our orders were taken, even as we saw people who arrived after us getting their order taken and receiving their cheese bread before us. We waited nearly 55 mins for our food and then proceeded to wolf it down. Couldn't find the server to ask for our check either.",0
173,173,"Really sad service. Bartender and Waitress both could not care less if we were happy. They just go through the motion. At the Bar we had to ""beg"" for a second drink. Waitress was always in a rush. My fish had sat under a warmer and was dry and brown around the edge. Table was too full of soiled dishes to place entrees. We have been to the Dal Rae over twenty times in the last ten years....but it's over for us.",0
174,174,"Ever since Riviera closed their doors, we have been looking for that classic, big booths, great food, great service dinner club. Dal Rae came highly recommended. Unfortunately a complete bust. Good - pours on drinks - great prices on bottles of wine. Food outstanding!!! Now the downer - Had rather high end wine ($200) and had to pour every refill myself after initial pour. And we were trying to milk the bottle, because our food took 40 minutes to come up. When it did, wife's ""Famous Dal Rae Pepper Steak came out medium well, rather than medium rare - so I go to eat my fish alone, to have a warm dinner til her new steak came. Very disappointing.",0
175,175,"Food was mediocre, one waitress leaned on the edge of our booth while gossiping with others. Another was walking around making rude noises and thought it was funny. If you want to impress a date by spending a lot then this is the place. But if you're more concerned with service and quality then look elsewhere.",0
176,176,"Dal Rae is a local gem to Pico Rivera like Clearman's Steak & Stein and King Taco. Their novelty is the main draw

Hostesses are subpar, a vodka gimlet by ""John"" is a treat, and live jazz music a plus in a cozy bar. Medallion Filet, Pepper Steak, and Chilean Sea Bass w/a glass of Summerland Pinot Noir were tasty, well prepared/ presented. Well dressed patrons ages 50 and up are the target crowd. Other reviews stated the service as ""OK"" at best. I agree

It's a 3 star eatery at 5 star prices, (our bill was fair at $300 including cocktails and tip) It's no Spago so be careful to go with company that you can enjoy yourself with anywhere and you should be fine. Otherwise, you'd rather enjoy a Flemings, Ruth Chris, Houston's, Clearman's, etc",1
177,177,"In Dal Rae's defense they are a steak house and I ordered Duck so most likely not a good choice to pick off the menu.
Duck was very dry and over-cooked. I did expect them to take it off the final bill but they offered up a free desert instead. I would consider giving them a second chance due to the positive history the restaurant has",0
178,178,Not what is used to be. We have been to this resturant many times. Just not the quality it was in years past. Very overpriced average meats. Lobster was a little chewy and zero sweetness to the taste. Sad- used to be my personal favorite.,0
179,179,"Service was very slow And the food was not worth the price. Lobster therm adore needed salt. We were there for over 2 hours, it was very disappointing.",0
180,180,"Did not realize menu would be different and prices were higher. Food was ok, I had to return my plate twice was to rare, I had asked for well done. I have been to this restaurant in the past and I had no problems but I was not to happy about this evening.",0
181,181,"Nothing wrong, but nothing really right. It is closer to my home than Arroyo Chop House and had hoped for a similar experience of a Caeser Salad made at the table, then a couple of apps before a chocolate souffle. Put in that basic order, the sald was made off to the side, never any interaction with the person preparing it. What's the point of saying it is prepared at the table, when it isn't really, but it might as well be prepared in the back and brought out. The feed was adequate, but nothing to have me come back for and the presentation of both salad and dessert was really lacking after seeing it done so much better. I was hoping for it to be better and save my wife and I the drive to Pasadena, but Arroyo Chop House is worth the drive.",1
182,182,"I am rating fair because that is the compromise between my excellent meal and my wife's poor experience.....went for Dine LA week, I had the filet and wife had the sand dabs....my food was delicious but hers was dry and seemed to be lacking....ultimately found out that the fish was supposed to have a butter sauce that didn't make it to the table....when we inquired about a sauce, the server brought one out and said 'try this', as if it was specially made because of our complaint....based on the normal prices at this restaurant, I would have a hard time coming back if this is the level of attention to detail....",0
183,183,"I took my friend here for her birthday lunch during Dine LA week. We were very excited to and thought it would be a neighborhood gem. It was lunch hours so it was semi crowded. Nonetheless, that does not justify for the slow service we received. The tables next to us had the waitress come by checking on them frequently, while no one checked on us for a good amount of time, or to even take our orders! We ordered some wine to celebrate and it was a good thing we did because the food took forever to come out. My friend almost finished her wine by the time the first course came out and the main course took a good 30 minutes too!The manager came around during our meal to greet the tables and he totally skipped ours! RUDE!",0

186,186,"Food was good; however, poor service detracted from the enjoyment of my husband's 65th birthday celebration. I have been there before for other birthday celebrations; however, this time was unfortunately the worst experience. From the beginning, our waitress was not very attentive, not offering menu information and only responding to our questions--really felt she didn't want to be there. We were never asked if 'everything was OK' or 'whether we needed anything'---always had to catch someone & ask, except for a man who briefly stopped by the table. This was a Wedk not a weekend. I have no problem with the cost of a great birthday celebration with friends and family; however, this evening was defnitely a disappointment!!!",0
187,187,"Friends recommeded it, read the wine list and it looked VERY promising. Business casual, superb wines listed and amazing food listed on the menu, all seemed a good combination for a date/birthday night with the wife, NOT. Waitress had no idea about the wines listed, wine list hadn't been updated in Years online. Food was great but the ambiance was horrible. They expect you to dress like you're at the Tam O'Shanter but give you an experience like you were at Chris & Pitts BBQ. Music in the room sounded like 92.3 The Beat, I kept waiting for the traffic report, in a darkened room. They even tried sitting to couples together at a booth meant for eight but the two couples didn't even know each other. FAIL! Typical Pico Rivera spot, no class.",0
188,188,"Not to impressed with our first visit. Had reservations at 8:30 and we still had to wait for over 30mins.After being seated, our waitress never did ask if we wanted any more drinks.
Food was OK... would have gotten better service at Chris and Pitts and for have the price. Menu list did not have the items I had seen on their web site so was kinda disappointed that I was unable to order what I wanted. Will I go back?? Not any time soon!",0
189,189,"Big mistake going to this high priced restaurant to celebrate a wedding anniversary with my wife hoping for a great dinner in a romantic setting. The place was jam-packed and extremely noisy for early weekday night. Tables and booths are too close together making it impossible to walk through with waiters and customers. Even though we had a booth, it was like sitting in front of the door to the kitchen with all the service traffic going in and out. Waitress was always in a big rush when visiting our table. Prices very high for everything. Extremely loud and noisy customers. Check for two was nearly $200. My filet mignon was stringy and not the quality of a top steakhouse. Lobster tail was good but priced at a ridiculous $65. Will not return",0

UNBELIEVABLE! she offered us an appetizer and said that should make up for the ""confusion"" but guess what?.....it didn't! how about you DO YOUR JOB!!!! for the same price as Ruth's Chris or Morton's I will not be coming there again! very unfortunate! I am a local and try to support our local business but not the Dal Rae.",0
191,191,Not Impressed with the pepper steak. The mashed potatoes were bland. It was highly priced for mediocre food.,1

We said it was no problem and that we would be at the bar having a drink. The host gave us an electronic beeper which would beep and vibrate when our table was ready. There were no seats so we had to stand in the vacinity of the bar area near the entrance to the restaurant. From where we were standing I could see that people who arrived after us were being seated before us. At 8.40 pm I asked the host about our table, she asked for my name again and said we would be next.... it was clear that she had forgotten all about us.
The waitress was good. The food was okay... nothing to rave about.",0

We had to wait 20 minutes past our reservation in an awkward area. The food was very disappointing. Neither by son or husband could eat the steak. The famous seabass was so over powered by onion, I didn't know it was fish. The dessert and the service were very good.",0
194,194,We had to wait about 45 minutes past our reservation time to be seated and it was not just us it was everyone coming in. If they are going to accept reservations they need to seat much closer to the time of the reservation. The other issue I had with Dal Rae is they serve bananas flambe which is to be prepared tableside but due to the tight space in the restaurant they were not able to wheel the cart over to make this dessert. If you are going to offer items prepared tableside then maybe you should have the space for it. I was very disappointed and not only will not be back but will be telling others about this bad experience.,0
195,195,"We were seated a half hour past time after inquiring what was going on. It was very crowded. After we were seated, two of our party waited for drinks. One of them arrived and there had to be a reminder for the 2nd person. The garlic bread ordered was finally served with the meal. Pepper steak arrived without the sauce and had to be sent back. They need to employ more people during this busy time. I was disappointed because having gone there for years had always had wonderful service.",0
196,196,lotsa peeps over 70+ dine here.   if u like being surrounded by the aarp crowd then this is the place for you.   food is just ok.,1
197,197,"Notable and desirable features of the menu, include farm-raised abalone (overshadowed by heavy sauce), duck (uncrisp skin), and free range chicken; sadly the kitchen skill is keeping up with some of the fine ingredients sourced. Even in the vintage '50's food could be manipulated to have sauce, flavor and texture. Dal Rae's style relies on too heavy a hand for sauces and dresses that are supposed to make the food better, richer, more like yester-year. It may work for many, but it's a shame. I'd like to go back, but I feel I've done the Dal Rae and there's no need for a repeat. I just wish they would lighten up, let the flavors through and enjoy fine food and a fine atmosphere.",0
198,198,"THE FOOD IS GOOD. HOWEVER, I DIDNT LIKE HAVING TO WAIT 20 MINUTES TO BE SEATED WHEN I HAD A RESERVATION.",1
199,199,"Food was good. Service was bad. Our server asked if I wanted something to drink. I ordered a glass of wine and she walked away without taking my bf's drink order. She came back with my drink & asked what we wanted to order. We both ordered 2 NY strip steaks. I asked for mine's medium & again she didn't ask my bf how he wanted his cooked or what side order, she just assumed he wanted to order the same as me, which was not the case. The food took about 30 mins to come out & after she dropped off our food she only checked on us once. She didn't bother to refill the drinks until the end of the meal & we didn't see her again after that. Someone else came by & dropped off the check. 15 mins later that same person picked it up. We left unimpressed",0
200,200,"Upon entering the restaurant, there was no host/hostess. 1 minute later someone walks by in front of me without saying hello, but walks to the check-in stand to pick up the phone first, which I thought was EXTREMELY rude. A simple ""excuse me"" before picking up the phone would have been appropriate, but I did not get that. When we were finally seated, there was only 1 menu on the table for a party of 3. I asked 3 different people walking by for more menus and for the wine list and it took them 15 minutes to bring it. The food was mediocre, and the entire experience at the beginning just seemed to ruin the mood for anything else.",0
201,201,THEY LET ME DOWN IN A BIG WAY BIRTHDAY LUNCH FOR TWO PEOPLE AND THEY DID NOTHING.,1
202,202,"Still baffled how a restaurant accepts reservations but makes you wait 1/2 hour to seat you? The hostess wasn't pleasant from the moment we walked in. We waited patiently for a table in the bar enjoying the music & a drink. After waiting 15 mins, I approached the sour hostess to inquire of our table. ""There's a party that checked in before so it'll be a little longer"" she tells me. When asked why a party that came in after us & also had 7:30 reservations was seated before us, she had the gall to say table was for party of 4. We were a party of 3...what's the difference? Needless to say we ate at the bar (fyi...the pager rang 20 mins later). While staff encountered at bar were great & food was decent, won't be dining here again.",0
203,203,"I was disappointed with food quality. I expected more. My hearts of romaine salad was drenched in really strong vineigrette dressing. It was very unpleasant. The shrimp scampi was too salty. Although the fish of the day (Chilean Sea Bass) was excellent, I was disappointed (overall) with the Dal Rae.",0
204,204,I got there at 7:30 and did not get my food til 9:15. The greeters were very rude and kept us waiting a long time for our table. It was really expensive and not worth every penny. I will never go there again.,1
205,205,"I was disaapointed in the room we were seated-which was the banquet room-way too many tables.
Some of our food was undercooked-prime rib and my fillet was rather tough. Service was OK, mostly due to the crowds though.
I have had much better experiences in this restaurant in the past.
Probably will not go back on busy dates and/or holidays-some loss of quality control when trying to feed/please that may people.
We were seated right away though as we had a 6 PM reservation.",0
206,206,"I have been to the Del Rae several times and usually enjoy the ambiance and steaks, however, during special events (in this case Valentines day) It was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had, and I ended up walking out before I had a chance to order. They had a set menu without what I usually order or want to order, and they opened up a banquet room, the tables and chairs used were so uncomfortable and small, the menues and drinks took up the whole table, and I was in the middle of a crowded room, it was very uncomfortable and not the way I expected to spend Valentines day with my date, so we ended up at Mortons. It's unfortunate because I usually really enjoy the Del Rae.",1
207,207,The portions are generous but greasy. The quality and presentation lack sophistication.,0
208,208,It is fairly cramped & crowded during lunch.,1
209,209,"I really liked the fact that I could make reservations on line.
The dining experience was okay.  I heard so many wonderful comments about Dal Rae that I was let down by the food. The taste of the tomato basil soup was bland.  The filet mignon was flavorless and took more time to cut then I expected. I was hoping for it to melt in my mouth.  The mashers were extra buttery which I enjoyed.  The food took a long time.  Our server was nice but seemed aloof.  When we asked about the pre-fix menu she didn't bother checking to see if they offered it she said that it was over on Easter but on the bill we received it said the exact dates.  I'm thinking she had an ""off"" night.  Overall, I thought it was alright but perhaps I'll give it another try.",0
210,210,Not enough meat on the medallions dish and birthday dessert was so so.  Not everyone likes chocolate chip cookies.  Cheesecake is the best.,1
211,211,"I remember when the Dal Rae was a quiet and intimate Steakhouse.

Now it's just as noisy as a contemporary Steakhouse, whilst retaining food quality that has kept this place relevant.

Fried zucchini for a starter, while slow to come out was _very_ tasty and a delight to eat.

Table-side Caesar salad was tasty, but me missus could eat much of hers...way too much Parmesan cheese. 

Steaks were coked perfectly and the grilled asparagus was also perfect. I don't know how the Dal Rae still calls the 'Famous'  pepper steak a pepper steak. What I got was a green, semi-leafy, pesto-like spread which, after one bite I pushed to the side of my plate.

PRO: Excellent service, wonderful food prepared and plated with care.
CON: Just another noisy (albeit tasty) Steakhouse.",0
212,212,"Placed as a party of two next to an extremely loud party of 10 who were drunk, loud and started a fight. In all of the years, Iâve been a patron at this restaurant, never experienced that. The waitress kept disappearing.
Food was brought out and it was not cooked per our request. Has to ask the hostess to help because our waitress kept disappearing.
When it finally came back the sides were cold, and the entrÃ©e was lacking in flavor.
Disappointing for such an expensive restaurant. Iâve been coming here for 20 years. Probably wonât go back for a while. ï¿¼
I couldâve gone to any number of other steak houses and not received search poor service or food. ï¿¼",0

Sat in the bar, which was wonderful, the musician was a bit loud. Especially for a holiday such as Valentineâs Day. The food was wonderful as expected. Iâve written two comments or submissions to Dal Rae, and have not received any response. We were overcharged on our bill , and itâs not the end of the world but Iâm kind of surprised for an establishment like Dal Rae not to respond.

217,217,"We had reservations at 8:15. Finally got seated a little after 8:45. Food wasnât bad, but not worth what you pay for. These are Ruth Chris prices, if not more but the quality wasnât Ruth Chris or any other fancy steakhouse.

We had the Rockefeller Oysters, ribeye steak, and creamed corn. Again, the food wasnât bad, just expensive for what youâre getting.",0
218,218,"I realize it was a Saturday night and that the restaurant was very very booked and there were also a couple big private parties but the service was not what Iâm used to at this particular restaurant and the food was great up until the main entrÃ©e in which someone at the table ordered prime rib medium rare And it came out so bloody that we had to send it back and when it came back out to the table after having a couple bites and there is a huge hair in her mouthâ¦ We had asked for Brandon as their server, heâs amazing but we were given a lady who is very polite and nice  although she forgot a few saucesâ¦ etcâ¦ we were seated at the far north west corner of the restaurant near the exit to I guess a banquet room or something and the staff kept having to squeeze by to get all the big trays into the banquet room and they were actually pushing on my chair and a couple times pushed on my shoulder and asked me to lean forwardâ¦. we kind of made it a game to see how many times I would get bumped, Stop counting after 25â¦ I will go back because the service is usually amazing and the food is usually on point and I live very happy! I shouldâve known better than a Saturday night! Everybody there is very friendly and they do work hard!",0

Upon check in I was told Main Dining Room was not accessible for Walkers or Wheelchair and was shown a table in side room with waiters computer, storage and light switches. Holiday lights didnât extend to that corner (we called it the utility room).  I complained and the âHostessâ told me rather condescendingly that âjust concentrate on enjoying family.â  I let it go so as to not to upset my handicapped sister.
Unpleasant experience especially since we spent premium for our meal.",0
220,220,"My husband and I came here for our anniversary and sadly we were a bit disappointed. The server didnât check on us very often and when he did he seemed like he was in a hurry, he was nice but seemed stressed almost. Once our meals were ready I had to ask for steak knives because they didnât bring us any on their own, the bread was cold, the butter was hard, I had to ask for a second round of drinks before our server ran off, we had already been sitting waiting for a while with empty glasses. Our server did bring us a complimentary piece of cake for our anniversary which was nice. (I think it was complimentary?)We were really looking forward to this dinner and a night out but our experience was not that great. It seemed like the larger groups around us received more attention than we did. The food was ok but not what I remembered when I was here a few years ago.",0
221,221,"They were not able to provide the same level of service during the holiday season,  as we had known them for.",1

Booths too low and difficult get out of. 

Steak lacked seasoning.

Sashimi toast excellent. 

Food sever excellent.

Definitely not an intimate setting.",0

228,228,Very crowded and noisy.service was not as good as we have always had. Disappointed.,1
229,229,I did not receive the same attentive service I had on Sunday. I believe the restaurant needs another waiter or waitress during the lunch hours.,0
230,230,I have always enjoyed Dal Rae. Steven our server was on point. If you look at any previous reservations Iâve had in the last year you can see that we have dined at some pretty nice places. I like Dal Rae because itâs close to our office and home. However I did notice that the place is looking a little run down. I wanted to pull out my DIY skills and give that dated bathroom a paint job. Really how much does it cost to replace falling wall paper!  The ceilings look dirty and there was mold on the walls where we were sitting. Far corner as you walk in. I have a party of 6 In our office and it wasnât the best experience for my co-workers.  They do notice these things. However the food and service was delicious but as far as appearance a much needed makeover is needed.,0
231,231,"Service was good but it took them about an hour to give us our table. We had reservations for 2 at 9. Other than that food was good service was good experience was ok. The place Was a Nice old school restaurant, it looks really old and not maintained well from the outside but inside itâs well kept old retro feel like If your in the early 90s.",1
232,232,"Dinner and service were outstanding. 

I made reservation online and called to confirm I had a guest in wheelchair was attending.  One down fall was not well planned access in and out of the restaurant was troublesome.  No staff came to assist us in moving chairs so the wheelchair could pass.",0
233,233,The creaked corn had cheese on it.,1
234,234,"I was very disappointed in their caesar salad, it was not as good as it once was.  It tasted very generic, like you could get at any coffee shop.   The others at our table were also disappointed in their food.  My husband ordered the sole and it was good.",0
235,235,One of the finest LA steakhouses!,1
236,236,Great food as usual but they forgot it was our anniversary.  Again! Kinda disappointed. They use to be better about it. Why ask if you are celebrating a special occasion if itâs not acknowledged.,0
237,237,It's been years since I've been here and not like I remembered it. I ambiance was good but the service was very disappointing. Forgot our drinks then brought the wrong one. Was snippy when we sent it back. Never came back once we got our meal to see if we needed anything. Crab in our appetizer was didn't tasting and oysters had been sitting out to long. Our main meal was great.,0
238,238,"Dal Rae is okay but not great as I expected it it to be. I spent over $200 for a dinner of three and felt the food was just okay. Also, I could only order fries for my little 2 year old because they had no kids friendly menu or kid entrees.

As for the service, the time we waited for our food was also okay. Not too long and just fine. This said, our server Miguel was very well mannered and polite. Love how he presented the food and took care of making it a special experience as best he could. He was excellent.

Something about this place and their food reminds me of when you go to a wedding event and the quality level of their entrÃ©es. So expect it to be similar but not different or special. Just good.

As for the ambience, it was really dated and certainly needs updating with at least some livelier new paint colors. A bit somber, especially the carpet and ceiling panels which need to be replaced.  

A pet peeve of mine was how the dress code was not enforced as business casual and saw many many people in their very casual clothes and some even in house shorts. Reminds me of when people go to form a line at a buffet in Las Vegas. Definitely not the upscale restaurant I was told it was and think I can get better for my money, elsewhere. Plus, they had no live music as I read a review or website somewhere mentioned. 

I took my wife and kids for motherâs day for the first time at Dal Rae and will not come again unless the owners show pride of ownership and bring up their brand with a fresh interior that we can say wow, this place is great! I think the owners have given up on making their restaurant modern for new foodies compared to say the look of a Cheesecake Factory or any newer restaurant. My assumption is they have an older loyal base of patrons who donât know the difference. If you are looking for a lunch meeting, this crowd might show this feeling I have from my past visit 4 years ago. Too pricey for what you get here if you ask me. I rather try a new restauran",0
239,239,"First time here. Went on Friday before Mother's day, to celebrate our anni. 
 The staffed asked us twice if we were celebrating a special occasion, not sure why they asked because they did nothing special for us. The food was very bland and safe we had to add salt and pepper to give flavor. I always heard great things about this place but was let down by the blandness of the food and service. Will not be coming back to spend a few hundred dollars to see if the food or service changes.",0
240,240,All was good! Lydia was a delight and very hospitable. Once the main course arrived filet steak and rib-eye it all went down. The streaks were cold and seems like they had been sitting for awhile. Wished we got a better food experience since it was our first time.,0
241,241,"Been coming here for 45 years but don't live close now.  Probably 5 years since our last visit.  Covid protocols have diminished the experience.  No at the table preparations, divided booths.  Came on a Sat night 5:30.  Place was packed and very loud.  Seemed cramped with the current seating.  Shrimp cocktail xlt, as was the filet pepper steak. Caesar salad a huge disappointment compared to what they did in the past.  They work hard at trying to provide an elevated dining experience, but the noise level and cramped feeling left us not wanting to return.  Remember, this a VERY expensive venue.  What always made it special in the past was the feeling of fine cuisine in a relaxed atmosphere featuring ""made at your table"" old school preparations.",0
242,242,"We were seated in a booth.  Right in the middle, next to us, was a loud, large party of approx 10.   Nobody could squeeze by their table,  we were so close we couldnât enjoy our meal.  Then another couple came over to say hi to them & stayed 20 min right next to us & kept brushing up against my husband as they stood next to our table.  
As a man said walking by because it was so tight & crowded- I hope thereâs not an earthquake!  

The food was as good as always.",1
243,243,Too crowded to where you canât enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant. Seems they value making a buck over the comfort of their customers. Food was not fresh and service is not what it used to be.,1
244,244,Service was great but foods was totally deferent from last time. I cannot recommend your place to my friends for while.,1
245,245,food was so rich we both had headaches and stomachaches after,1
246,246,"We have been to the Dal Rae many times over the years, Our favorite place to go for special occasions . Food was outstanding , as always. But this time the service was VERY poor , not like the Dal Rae's usual service . When we spend $$$$ I expect at least good service . I notice new faces there last night , maybe that's the reason . I do plan on calling them directly as I was very disappointed . The servers assistance was more helpful then the server, I wanted to give her the tip and not him .",0
247,247,"Now how I used to remember Dal Rae. Main dish was good. Bread was not warm, butter straight out of fridge, canât spread. Ambiance Lighting in main dining room was nice, but them someone dimmed it twice and left it way too dark.  No more dressing up,   people coming in with t-shirts and jeans. It was always a place to dress up for. Thank you.",1
248,248,Dinner wasnât hot. Service person was very nice but stretched.,1

252,252,A long drive for nothing special,1
253,253,We celebrated our anniversary and were looking forward to being pampered as usual at the Dal Rae. Unfortunately that didnât happen. Gabriella was the server and she was not interested in serving. Her attentiveness was comparable to what you experience at Chiliâs. It was so far below what we have come to expect at the Dal Rae over the years weâve been patronizing it. I asked the assistant manager about the drop in level of service. He said it was due to Covid. I told him the baked potatoes used to be prepared by the server. He mumbled about Covid. I pointed out that the other tables around us received that. Our table didnât. But our table had Gabriella as the server. He said he would talk to her. I asked him to do that after we left. I couldnât take a chance on her service deteriorating further. The filet pepper steaks were so-so. My wifeâs was done to perfection and was definitely a prime cut. It was a melt in your mouth cut. Mine was chewy and way overdone. I asked Gabriella twice for a small dish of Bernaise sauce to make it palatable. She finally brought it after a lengthy wait. She acted annoyed by us. She dropped by just a few times during our meal. I waited patiently since my steak was not edible as presented from the kitchen. This was not an experience to remember. This was the first bad experience weâve had at the Dal Rae so we will give it another try. Splendid and memorable service has been the normal in the past. I hope it will return to being customary.,0
254,254,"Of course it is almost holiday season, so it was busy, crowded.  But they don't have enough waitstaff.  It was at least 20 minutes before anyone came to our table.
We ordered garlic cheese bread to have as an appetizer, it didn't come until the entrees came, a long, long wait after we ordered.  Don't get me wrong, the server was nice.  But she must have had too many tables and we barely saw her all evening.
Food is always good.  But it shouldn't take 3 hours to have dinner!!!!",0

The bar service was mediocre, not refined.  The food was excellent as always. We ordered at least 2-3 cocktails each.  We ordered salads and they were fresh.  We ordered Salmon, ribeye, prim rib and sea bass all of which were excellent.  I will not return during dinner hours.  The restaurant was too packed especially during Covid picking up again.  The tables were much too close to one another.  It was difficult to get out of our booth because someoneâs chair was almost right up against our table.  Did I say our waitress was superb!",0
262,262,"My wife and I went out on a Tuesday night for our wedding anniversary dinner. The waitress must have been really busy but she made no effort to know who we were, why we were there, and worst of all seemed annoyed at everything we said even though we didnât take any extra time ordering and making a concerted effort to be nice and cordial given her visible annoyance on her face. The first time we were able to tell someone that it was our anniversary was when the floor manager asked us right before getting our dinner. The steaks were fantastic as usual. Finally right after we finished our dinner the waitress finally came up to us and asked why were there and her whole demeanor changedâ¦ it made me feel like she was trying to preserve a decent tip despite her service being under parâ¦ this place is usually our go-to spot for special occasions for me and my wife, this is our first time with an experience like this so hopefully this isnât a trend.",0
263,263,"I'm willing to cut the wait staff the benefit of the doubt with slow service, but the fact that the receptionist was cold, uncaring and unresponsive is inexcusable.",0
264,264,Kitchen must have been slammed. Very long wait for entrees.,1
265,265,"You can tell the servers are all new....the prime rib was at least a day old, not fresh. The server whisked my plate away (with food on it) to dispose of and didnât even ask if I wanted to take the leftovers. Best part of the meal was honestly dessert and the bread",0
266,266,"Iâm a regular, only one server actually knows how to make the Cesar salad for two, every other sever makes it too lemony or vinegary, I canât pin point what it is. The older white gentlemen makes the salad worth having, everyone elseâs is disappointing. Not enough salt on the Tomahawk ribeye last night. Not enough garlic in the garlic mashed potatoes either. Filet mignon was good. Cheese bread and the Don Julio neat were perfect, but thatâs not hard. I donât mind paying $350 for a meal but it has to knock it out every time. Consistency is so important, if I have to think twice about going back thatâs not good. I average once every 6 months now when I used to go once a month. Do the math.",0
267,267,"First of all, the restaurant was packed. They were pretty much operating at full capacity. Every table was filled, which I wasnât expecting, especially on a Wednesday night, let alone during covid.  Servers and wait staff were all wearing masks. Our waitress did disappear for a while towards the end, as we asked for boxes and had to ask another member of the staff to get them for us. The manager walked by the other tables and was checking on them, but never came by to check on us, and we were sitting adjacent to the tables he was checking on. I found that a little distracting, as it seemed he was giving others special treatment and making small talk. When we finally received our boxes, we had thought the staff was going to pack it for us, as we saw the other tableâs leftovers packed for them. However the wait staff handed us our boxes and said they usually donât pack it due to covid. I didnât know what to believe because I just saw them pack an entire partyâs food right next to us without explanation. It just didnât seem like we were be treated equally. Regardless, we tipped well and still enjoyed our meal, but it definitely could have been a better experience.",1
268,268,"Nice ambience, food was good, but a little pricey.  Wine selection was good.  Customer service was good.",1
269,269,"Prime rib, which was reason we traveled to Dal Rae, was not as generous in portion size, taste, or tenderness as I recalled from previously dining there on multiple occasions over previous 30+ years.

Adherence to COVID guidelines was excellent but was outside with little ambience.",0

Actually, my group were preferred to book at 6pm because we were very hungry but we don't want to eat outside of the restaurant, so we were still booked at 7pm. Plus, restaurant worker have called me to confirm for dine-in reservation. But when we were arrival, the usher has just told us that our group couldn't be dine-in/inside of the restaurant. I was very upset when my group were arrival to the restaurant and usher just told me I couldn't dine in with an attitude to state that the restaurant does not guarantee on it.  Then, what is meaningful to make a reservation!!! If not guarantee to dine in, it should state clear in advance, not just said it at arrival.",0

273,273,"I was thrilled to finally dine here after a long time away due to Covid restrictions.  I can say though, that after observing the different dining areas at the restaurant, we were seated at the most populated area under a huge canopy tent.  This area didnât provide for the best ambiance as compared to the other two dining areas.  I thought I booked far enough in advance to be seated at a prime spot but anyhow, this wasnât a big deal.  What I did mind was the service.  The woman waiting on me was very short with us, and seemed to be rushing our order.  We hadnât had a nice meal in ages, and she seemed impatient the entire time.  Iâm comparing my experience with the service to when I was seated in the other area of the restaurant, which now I realize is probably reserved for high rollers a la Vegas style.  Had a good experience overall but felt super rushed.",1
274,274,"Having been going to Dal Rae for over 20+ years Iâm sad to say that tonightâs meal did not met the years of previous service. Letâs start by saying they must ha w places us in the coldest table...I had a wear my jacket with hood up, a cashmere headband, 2 blankets (one for my legs and one for my back (which I brought myself). The waitress asked me if I was cold (a duh). There was a heater nearby but literally next to a table of 2 and about a hour into our dining experience she finally asked a fellow male employee to move it more towards the middle of both our tables which than helped take the chill from my back (I was than able to remove the blanket I had wrapped around my back & next). The service was very slow and the food took even longer. So overall our âGal-entineâs Dayâ dinner wasnât as expected especially from Dal Rae.",0

279,279,"We love going to the Dal Rae, that's why we took my brother there on his birthday.  Our server, manger and cook were all so great, but the one to the older hostess, was a bit lame and snobby, which kind of killed of our celebratory evening!!  She sat us at the very back of the restaurant right as the sun was going down, which meant an hour of getting blasted with sunlight and heat!  I asked if we could be seated at one of the other tables that were empty and that wouldn't have us sweating to death, which we did!!   She said, ""no, those tables where reserved,"" which I said, ""but we had reservation too,"" but I guess that didn't matter to her and then in a very condescending tone she said, you'll be sitting under the tent,"" which she very much knew wasn't doing anything for us during the sunset!!  Very insulting!!  I hate to write out a bad review since everyone else there was so great, but I just guess it's just""'one bad apple...!""

283,283,"We love DalRae for special occasions. It was our anniversary and it was noted in the Open Table reservation.
A good server makes or breaks the dining experience. Unfortunately our server broke the experience. Very rushed, careless attitude and minimal follow up, I had to get her attention after our entrees were served for more sauce for one dish.  
There was no acknowledgement of our anniversary even though numerous special occasions around us were recognized by other wait staff.  Very disappointing service from her. Our numerous previous experiences here have all been excellent.
On the positive side, the food was excellent and the support staff (busser) were very attentive and helpful.
Based on this experience not sure if we'll go back.  
There are not many iconic independent dining establishments anymore that provide a superior dining experience. Hopefully this was a one time poor experience and Dal Rae is not losing it's long standing tradition of excellence.",0
284,284,"We had a 5:30 reservation.  We were seated right at 5:30 but had to wait almost 5 minutes before our server came.  She brought menus but didn't take a drink order for possibly another 5 minutes.  It was certainly different than most places I've been to.
After the delay in menus and drink orders, everything went good. I'm thinking your servers don't start working until 5:30 and by the time they get ready, it's 5:40. 
If I go again I'll make reservations for 6pm.",1
285,285,The service is excellent.  Food is good but onion soup is extremely salty.,0
286,286,"the four of us went for lunch... i'll have to say the food was quite good along with the ambience....

i found the noise level to be a bit loud but that seemed to be the nature of the crowd at the time we were there. Not too loud for us to carry on a conversation, though.

my annoyance is along two levels, the first being that for a business lunch the valet parking does not allow for a quick exit if needed, and on this particular day, the service (the waitress was nice and efficient) meaning the food prep took an inordinately long time to be brought out. We ordered the veal marsala, two sea bass luncheons and a pork schnitzel which took about 40""+ to be served  i know that this could be improved upon.",0
287,287,"Made a reservation several days ahead, yet we sat in a booth designed for three next to the kitchen door .  We were four people.  It was uncomfortably tight, noisy and I kept getting rocked by the kitchen door banging against the back of my seat.  Food is pricey.  The only meal really enjoyable was the gigantic filet mignon.  It was really well cooked - medium rare. My husbands wagyu was very disappointing.  Overall, we found it over priced, too tightly packed and noisy.  It was not a relaxing dining experience.",0
288,288,"This was our second visit. The first visit was great the service was a amazing. This time the service really was not very good. It took them long to come over and take our order and over the course of the meal the server did not check in very often. It was a real contrast from the first time. 

The food was amazing we really liked the escargot and the french onion soup. The steak was cooked perfectly as usual.",1
289,289,"As I made a reservation over a month in advance, we expected better seating. We arrived to an EXTREMELY busy & overbooked restaurant. Instead of being seating in the dining area, we were seated in the bar area right next to the restrooms & in the path of the servers' entrance/exit to the kitchen. After being jostled around for 15 minutes, we realized this was not going to work. We asked the hostess to reseat us, especially since the reservation was made well in advance to avoid this exact situation. Not only was she extremely rude & dismissive but she tried to put the blame on us. It wasn't until someone in our group name dropped, did we start receiving the customer service we expected from this establishment. We finally received better seating after another 15 minutes. The food was delicious, but unfortunately, one person in our party had food that was undercooked. After the re-fire, it was still undercooked. 
Needless to say, our overall experience was disappointing.",0

291,291,"Like an old-school, Hollywood steak house.  Traditional dishes.  Quality staff who are prompt and attentive without being too intrusive.  Food is quite rich.  Dishes are plentiful.  A bit pricey.  Wedge salad with blue cheese has large chunks of very tasty blue cheese - perhaps too much.  Medallions of Filet Mignon were tender, savory and delicious, and come with a massive side of mashed potatoes.  We passed on alcohol for this dinner, split a salad and had two plates of medallions - which came to $93 before tip.  It was nearly full on a Tuesday evening at 7:30 so reservations are a must.",0
292,292,"To the management of Dal Rae,
I am glad to offer my comments as a positive critique from a fan of your fine restaurant.
As this survey has indicated, I had lunch with two close friends who drove from San Diego specifically to have lunch with me on my birthday. The Dal Rae was our first choice.
Honestly I have to say I was very disappointed with the food quality this time. I ordered the Dal Rae Club, but it was dry and was in no way exceptional- having your good name attached to it.  My two other guests ordered the prime rib lunch special, and they both thought that was unremarkable too. The waiter was friendly and attentive, but it does seem more attention to the food quality needs to be emphasized.  
We haven't given up on Dal Rae and will try again soon and hope to see some improvements- your legacy remains impressive.",0
293,293,Restaurant was basic. Steak was dry. Best part of the meal was oysters and escargot. Food also took extremely long to come out,1
294,294,"Food is very good. We have been there before for meetings, dinners, etc. Can't help but notice that the place has not been updated or renovated or at least a minor cosmetic make over for years.
I can see stains in the ceiling. This is why I think they keep the restaurant very dark
We valet as usual, and they kept our car window open ( w got an alert on the phone).",1
295,295,"My husband and I have been to Del Rae on several occasions. I decided to take a friend visiting from Texas to a nice restaurant. The hostess was very nice and sat us quickly. Our waitress greeted us and told us about the DineLA . Both my friend and I thought it was a terrific way for her to try different items. We ordered different appetizers, entrees, and deserts. Our waitress brought out our appetizers and they were delicious. She then dropped our glass water container on the floor and left it on the  side so another gentleman came by and tried to pour me water from the same container until I told him it had been in the floor. Our entrees came out and they were fantastic!  My friend was still eating her meal and our deserts were already in front of us! The waitress was asking her if she was done even though she could see she was still eating her steak.We felt rushed and it was not like the service my husband and I have had in the past. I was extremely disappointed with the service my friend and I received.",1
296,296,"This is usually a great place for a steak. Afterall, it's what they do. My filet was cooked improperly and after three attempts, they couldn't get it right. As I said, this is usually a great place, it was just a miss the other night.",1
297,297,Prices are outrageous. The food is extremely rich and oversauced. The shrimp was sodden with grease. Portions sre very large. It has a very dated atmosphere and coukd use a thirough cleaning.,0
298,298,"Had a reservation but had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. Ordered table side Caesar salad but due to space it was made away from the table, would have been nice if they had communicated this to us. Part of the reason you order this is to watch it be made at the table.

Service was so so, I was unimpressed as in the past service had been great.",0
299,299,Food was good. French 75 was delicious,1
300,300,"Food was good but service was slow. We waited awhile for our waitress to bring our billl. Also, our table space was so small. My poor tall husband had to scoot in so tight because there was no space.",1
301,301,Not their best effort on service. Pepper steak ordered Medium Rare; came out Medium +. Sent back  still frozen,0
302,302,The hostess was very rude when we checked in. Then just kind of threw our menus down on the table in a pile and walked off. When we ordered a soufflÃ© for dessert I was told that the 35 minute wait would upset the hostess because they wanted our table. She said tbe hostess would kick her butt for not telling us they had soufflÃ© earlier. Who says that?  I ordered something else instead. We spent $200 for dinner snd would have liked to have been treated with a little more respect. The waitress felt bad and brought me a piece of cake on the house but it will be a while before I return. Is the hostess the bosses' wife?  She seriously needs and attitude change,0
303,303,"I felt a little ignored I was there celebrating my son's & aunts Birthdays, his first time there. The reason for being ignored was we didn't order any cocktails and the waitress just walked away didn't come back for awhile because she was socializing with the ""regulars"", you could tell the regulars received special attentions, but I guess the ones who don't live close by and only come maybe once a year get ignored.  I used to come many times as child my parents would bring me there, since then I moved and it had been years since I visited,  it will probably years again. :(",0
304,304,Dinner date with my son. I have been coming here for several years and never have I had such bad service. My server took twenty minutes to come to our table after I had to get the hostess to get her. When she arrived she didnât even apologize just said are you ready? Iâm sorry but I been in the industry for years and I get we get busy but really you donât apologize just get to the point to what we want rudely? Not what one excepts at the establishment. She was never was  around when we needed her. Very disappointed of how we were treated.,0
305,305,"I am very sad to see how much this place has changed, it used to be a gem of a place, remanence of a bygone era.
I had not been to this place in about 5 years, and I was very disappointed with the quality of food, and how this place has become one more of the bunch.
This place has become very overpriced, and not worth the experience anymore.
I wish places like this will go back to the era where quality and service, is more important than quantity.",1
306,306,"Too fancy for the area.  Their signature pepper steak was delicious but the sides were an after-thought.  The creamed corn was bland, as was the mac and cheese.  The portions were huge though, so they have that going for them.  The bread basket was a joke with stale bread and crackers that can break a tooth.  The valet was also overpriced at being $6.50.",0
307,307,It was ok. The  waitress   spilled the teriyaki sauce on my shirt and pants and didnât apologize.   Told manager and they played it off like nothing of it.,0
308,308,"We have been coming here for years, and always love the food and the ambiance.  Our waitress was great and the food was wonderful (pepper filet, chilean sea bass, prime rib).  The only disappointment was the blonde hostess who was rude.  We were a party of six, and arrived in two separate cars about ten minutes from one another.  The other party were our guests and when they arrived, the hostess attempted to seat them in the patio room not the main dining room.  They went out to look at it, and besides being the only people in the room, the room was very cold (temperature wise).  They explained to the hostess that we wanted to sit in the main dining room which is much nicer and which is what really makes the restaurant so special.  The hostess then had them sit at the bar while they waited for us.  When we arrived, we checked in and told them we would wait at the bar with our guests until our table was ready.  After hearing nothing from the hostess for about half an hour, I went up to the hostess station to check on our table, and she asked if our guests had showed us the table in the patio room and if that would be ok for us.  I said that it would not be, and reminded her that it was cold in the patio room and that we wanted to be seated in the main dining room.  The hostess then barked at me stating that it would be at least another hour before we would be seated!  I was a bit taken aback, given that our reservation was for 6:00pm, and that at 6:30pm when I checked I was told it would be at least another hour before we would be seated.  I commented that an hour an a half wait did not speak very well for OpenTable reservations!  I went back to the bar and sat with our guests, and about twenty minutes later the hostess came up to me and said they had found another party of 6 that agreed to be seated in the patio room and that she could now seat us in the dining room.  I was pleased, and thanked her.  I must say that I found her attitude to be very rude.",0
309,309,"The beef short rib was disappointing in size, cooking and presentation. The waitress was also disappointing. Not enthusiast about her work.",1
310,310,"The Dal Rae is a regular spot for us and we always give a 5 star review in all areas.   We are really easy people to please as most of us have worked in the hospitality industry and we know how busy it can get during the holidays.  Not sure what happened on this day.  We had an early reservation for a party of 6 on Christmas Eve and we seemed to off to a good start until our server began telling us how many reservations were no shows and they should take a credit card for parties of 6 & above.   During our meal the restaurant never did get very busy and our server continued to give us a count of the no shows.  We ordered our wine and when that was delivered we ordered our meal and I had ordered the spinach salad as a first course and requested extra bacon and dressing.  We all decided it must have been a joke of some sort because when it was delivered there was at least a 12-16 oz of bacon on the salad and it was floating in dressing.  I am not exaggerating at all, there was more bacon than spinach and it was so drenched in dressing that it pooled to the edge of the plate.  I should have take a picture of it.  When my onion soup was delivered, the server said we did to offend our server, we were pretty low key, certainly not demanding in any way.  I will say that everyone else's meals were excellent (including their onion soup).  Then we ordered coffee which was delivered stone cold.  Not warm but stone cold.  It was a very disappointing evening in all.",0
311,311,"The reason I didnât give the Dal Rae 5 stars was because me and my date waited almost an hour after my reservation time. Also if donât know anybody in the restaurant staff they wonât seat you right away.  for example, While waiting I saw a lot of people just arriving and after hugging and talking to someone they knew they got seated right away because they knew the  hostess or a waiter working that night. By but once we got seated the service and the food was great. I will give it another Dal Rae Restaurant another try soon and hopefully I get seated close to my reservation time.",1
312,312,They forgot to seat us even with a reservation. Had to ask several times.,1

Brought appetizers and salad at the same time and basically threw it at us. Donât think she smiled once.  Will go back because everything else was awesome food drinks etc. especially Ronnie in the lounge!!,0
314,314,"The drinks were over priced.  The potato was average and for a fancy place,  I thought people were under dressed and didn't realize it was kid friendly.  I thought I was going to have a romantic dinner.  I just heard great things and was a bit disappointed.",1
315,315,Went on Thanksgiving and was just ok.  Seemed way over priced for quality of food. Dessert pumpkin pie was horrible and didnt even taste right with color dark and off.  May try again in future but will be a while and not on a holiday.  Place was slow and waitresses stood at bar and took a while to get refills on basic drinks.  Disappointing!!!!,0
316,316,"I think my review is based on first impressions of this night.  The hostess that actually sat us was not engaged, just placed the menus on the table and walked away.  Maybe she had a bad night, but when you're paying the prices that Del Rae charges, I would expect a little more.

But, our server was amazing-- the food was good!  My husband loved his drink as well.",0

319,319,"Caesar Salad is delicious! 
Service incredibly slow.  
Even though a Birthday Celebration was noted in Open Table, and the waitress saw the gifts (and commented), and I was holding a birthday card, the waitress did not offer a celebration cake nor ask if we wanted dessert. Several tables had singing, candles, and birthday wishes... my guest DID NOT. 
I mentioned the lack of celebration to the hostess as we left, and we received a very lackluster, âsorryâ.  
Not happy. Nor was my birthday guest :(",0
320,320,Nice and accommodating wait staff (although definitely short handed). Unfortunately food was just so-so. I was hoping for far better for as ritzy (and pricey) this restaurant makes itself out to be.,1
321,321,"Surprised that in this area there is inadequate parking and you must valet for $4.50. That said, the ambiance once inside is that of an up scaled establishment though seriously dated but very well maintained. The staff is well trained and officious. The food is upscale as well and the prices reflect it. The dishes we had at our table included a corned beef rueben, a plate of filet beef stroganoff, and a chopped salad. The Reuben was a mistake but it came with an extra large plate of thin cut fries. I had the stroganoff made with penne pasta. The sauce was lacking some key ingredients like worcestershire, catsup, sour cream. There was no sauce per se; only a coating on the pasta. The plate was large and full of meat. I was just disappointed with the flavors. We also shared some deep fried zuccini slices which were nice and crispy.

The chopped salad looked great. I didnt get to sample it. I will come back and sample a few other menu items as this seems like they do know what they are doing.",0
322,322,EntrÃ©e was excellent. Salad was mediocre. Service was so-so. We had to remind the waitress.,1
323,323,"They were really busy, we waited 40 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. There were a couple of other little problems. However this is really the only time it has been like that in our 4-5 visits. The Manager is always really great and so was our server. Food is never a question - perfect.",0
324,324,"The place feels tight, tables are near to each other, we sat at our table around 5:40pm ... food was served almost 7:00pm , kids were so hungry. My advice is too eat a light snacks before coming to this resto . The food that we ordered were so delicious and tasty...  No regrets.",1
325,325,"Dal Rae has always been a place for very good food, good service  and a convenient location off the 605 Freeway & Washington Blvd. It makes for a compromise location when meeting friends from, say, Pasadena and L.A.-West Side., when I come up from Orange County.  I had the Chinese Chicken salad, for a lunch with friends. Their salads, with lots of greens and turkey, were fine. Mine was OK, but the horseradish in the dressing, dominated flavors in my salad. I like horseradish, just not so much. It was an unwelcome surprise. As such, this was the first time I've ever been dissatisfied  with a dish here.  Still, it's good enough to make return trips, lunch or dinner. One minor flaw in dozens of visits is tolerable, certainly. I'll come back.",0
326,326,The restaurant is so dark you need your phone light to read the menu. The Caesar  salads have way too much chopped garlic. I actually think there must have been 1/4 cup in our 2 salads. The veal Oscar was not very tender and the sea bass was a little overcooked. The chocolate souffle was excellent and not raw in the middle. It was light and fluffy and the cream was yummy.,0
327,327,Lobster with mushroom was too hard...i wished it was soft like.. it was like me chewing gum..  lobster should not be hard,1
328,328,"We had a fair time however, the lobster bisque made my husband and I sick! His stomach was grumbling and by the time we arrived home he had to go straight or the bathroom. I also had a bad stomach ache and the. I ran to the bathroom! We both could not tolerate the bisque. We didnât finish our dinner because of that and ended up taking 3/4 of it to go! When the waitress asked if we were celebrating anything special we answer Yes, itâs my husbands bday today, the 21at & my bday was earlier this month. She brought a slice of lemon cake and didnât even sing Happy Bday. We then saw that the table next door had 3 waitresses sing Happy Bday! We felt that they didnât pay too much attention to us either, perhaps because we ordered from the Dine LA menu instead of the regular one? We did notice others celebrating bdays and even Anniversary and they got full attention! I went to the bathroom and looked at the table and saw what they had ordered  Oyster Rockefeller and the salad that is prepared table side as well as food not in the Dine LA menu. So my feeling was confirmed that they treat customers better and get more attention when itâs feomtje regular menu. Not a pleasant feeling! Will not be recommending this place! Oh and BTW I ended up discarding the leftovers because mashed potatoes and fish simply do not warm up too good!!",0
329,329,"Only problem was the horrible smoke smell.  My clothes still stink.   There was someone at the bar smoking nonstop right outside the bar and left the door open the entire time he was outside.   The food, service, everything is always top notch.  The smoke smell spoiled the overall experience.",0
330,330,"I have been to this place a few times late 2017 and 1/8/18. All these times, service has fallen short of our expectations. Although the waitress was very nice, she failed to come by our desk to see how we were doing. The other 2 guests with me were in need of service and the entire time we were there, the waitress never came to check on us. They did not eat their lunch. I don't like that they don't write down our orders. I asked for very little dressing on my salad and it came drenched in dressing. My friend asked for mustard and dressing from the sandwich on the side and they added it to her sandwich. They took our drink order wrong. Also, upon arriving, the hostess was very cold and unfriendly. I will think twice about coming to this place again. I bring clients here to impress them but, the joke is on me.

331,331,"The food is great. But our service was slow. We had to run out to a meeting and I was held up waiting for the food (so we took it to go which took a while too), and waiting for the bill was another wait. If you are there for a casual dinner it's great. Not for a business lunch if you are pressed for time.",0
332,332,"Dal Rae's dinner menu is  over priced, especially the Holiday menu.  The portions are reasonable but do not match the price of the meal.  As soon as the last course is finished, your check is placed on the table, and the owner stops by every five minutes to thank you for dining with them so that you feel uncomfortable and leave.  Since most people are in a hurry to get back to work at lunch,  hurrying you to leave isn't a problem.",0
333,333,The food was great. But the service left a bit to be desired. They should have prepared more adequately for the holiday. We had a reservation at 8pm and by 830 we had still not been seated. Instead we had to be relegated to sit in the bar area to have our meal. We made the best out of the situation. Also did not appreciate my meat being over cooked when I asked for it blue and I got medium rare instead. Do not know if I will ever be back.,0
334,334,"My family and I have been coming here for decades and have never had a disappointing meal, until this last visit for lunch. Yes, it was busy for the holidays, but we expected that. What we didnât expect was the disappointing meal. Our sandwiches would have been better quality at our local sandwich shop at a fraction of the cost. I hope this doesnât mean Dal Rae is going downhill. This restaurant has been a gem for decades and our favorite special occasion place but we will never go back for lunch. Weâre hoping this was a one off and not the start of a downward spiral.",0
335,335,"This was our 4th visit to Dal Rae and compared to the previous three times, the dining experience was a disappointment. First off, we've never reserved a table through open table which is perhaps why despite making reservations three weeks in advance, we were not seated in the main dining area, but rather the newly enclosed patio. While it was conducive to conversation (quieter especially since my father is acutely deaf), it was cold and nowhere near as ambiant. It was my parents first time there, so we were super excited to treat them to a fun night. Being seated out there was hugely disappointing. Then on top of it, the service was just so, so - not superior as it had been in the past. Our waitress seemed stressed from the moment she took our drink order. We had another waitress, who delivered out drinks take our appetizer order. It was just not an in sync tag team if our ask me. Anyway, the food was delicious, we had escargot, firecracker rock shrimp, the Caesar salad and all of us had the pepper steak. No complaints where the food is concerned. We made the most of our experience, but if we're going to go out and spend $500 we want it to be memorable in every way. Though we've have great experiences before, it is doubtful we'll be back. Thank you for allowing us to review our experience. Hopefully it will be helpful to others. And I strongly recommend calling the restaurant direct to request a table in the main dining area, especially during the holidays!

Sincerely,

We asked to be moved to a table with chairs because members in our party could not fit at this table.  The seating hostess was short with me, and said they didn't have room.   She moved us to a table in the bar area.  The table itself was better, but we were at a table in the middle of the room and the bar was loud, and had people bumping our chairs ever few minutes - not what I wanted for a special holiday lunch for my staff.   There was also many elderly people that were trying to negotiate the aisles, and it was very difficult due to the close proximity of the tables.   I was disappointed.",0
340,340,Food was great and our bus boy was fanatic as for our waitress she was rude forgot some of our side dishes and we felt rushed by her she only came by when she had to bring us our food when it was time to pay we waited 20 minutes and she was no where to be found so another waitress took our bill hopefully when we go back we wonât get her again.,0
341,341,"Our third time there. We started off great with friendly server, but the food arrival was VERY SLOW.  Were they slammed?? It isn't holiday season yet, but they seemed not to be able to handle the crowd on Sunday evening.  The food was very good, but service too slow, and we didn't get to see the server very often, timing on desserts was very off.  When I asked to take home the rest of my dinner, all the busboy packed was the meat, not the veggies nor the potatoes.  I didn't ask for only half my dinner to be packed, I asked for ALL my leftovers to go home with me.  This was a major screw-up, yet we got no apology.  I think this was a very poor showing of the usually good service at Dal Rae",0
342,342,"We went with a party of 8 to celebrate a birthday. Six adults and two 6 year olds. We had a reservation and were sat promptly and got our drinks rather quickly. However, once we placed our food order the service went from great to horrible. Our food didnât arrive for about 90 minutes after we sat down. The waitress said the cook didnât see our order. Once we finished eating we wanted to order dessert, but the waitress never came back! Finally over two hours after getting there we decided it was going to take too long to order dessert as the waitress said she could
Microwave desserts to speed them up because the kitchen was busy. We finally walked out at 7:30, two and a half hours later with no dessert. We also had empty drinks throughout the meal. For the price of the restaurant you would expect better service!",0
343,343,Great place but server was not up to par.  Pianist was good but not a good singer.,1
344,344,Food is great but the waitress forgot us and were too busy either in the kitchen or watching the Dodger World Series game. Service can be worked on.  We were literally forgotten and we needed our check.,0
345,345,The escargot was too salty. The medium rare tomohawk steak was dry and didnât have a lot of flavor. Tables were too close together and too expensive for what youâre getting. The only thing that was exceptional was the service but I wouldnât go back. Sorry,0
346,346,"It was ok, wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. Drinks weren't made the original way, old fashioned and manhattan were very disappointing. Overall food  was good but not for the price but crab cakes were outstanding.",1
347,347,The table side Cesar salad for two is really tasty.,0
348,348,"Usually this is a wonderful place to dine. It was one of my favorites. But our last visit was such a disappointment. The prime rib was unusually fatty and the flavor not quite correct.  The lobster was okay but small for the price. The service was so so and compared to our last visit quite disappointing.
It was a special occasion for us and although they kept asking us if it was a special occasion at least 3 times and seemed to indicate they were going to bring us a dessert they brought us our check. 
I'm hoping that this was just a fluke and our next visit will be up to their usual standards.",0
349,349,"Our recent @ Dal Rae was disappointing. After years of top notch service & ambiance they have tried to reach a new audience. Although we had reservations we were put in an awkward dining hall, no table settings...hostess very blasÃ©. I hope they go back to their higher standards. Food good..",1
350,350,This is our second time in dal Rae. The food is excellent. The first time at dal Rae; the waitress was informative and focused on us. She payed attention to us and made sure our table was clean. She brought clean utensils when our entrees arrived and made sure our drinks were full. Our second time there we did not receive the same customer service. Out table was unkept the plates were piled up. I left my fork on the appetizer plate and had to retrieve it when my entree arrived. I had to flag her down to catch her attention. We did not get the same customer service as we did the first time we went there.,0
351,351,"This was my second visit to Dal Rae, the first one having been a much better experience. I think that it just boiled down to a service deficit this time.  We were consistently ignored every step of the way: to get menus, to order, to be served, to send something back that was not cooked enough, to obtain a dessert menu, to order coffee. I think my chair must have been bumped at least 3 times by waitstaff rushing by to serve other tables. Other parties came and left as we waited and waited for our waitress. She was hard of hearing, and mis-heared a couple of items that I ordered, also didn't understand simple questions such as ""what are the sides that come with that entree?"" due to a hearing problem. She was not trained well enough to politely ask me to repeat what I'd said. The upshot of being ignored is to not feel like a valued customer. It costs $4.50 just to park at this restaurant and the menu prices are  on the high side, so I came fully expecting to be receiving attention and to feel like a welcome guest.",0

Potatoes and salad tasty, dessert not unique or yummy.
All in all, after wanting to go for years, it was disappointing",0
355,355,"The food was great but the table we were placed at was a little small for a party of our size, the chairs were not comfortable and the noise level was very very high.  Service was also stupendous.",0
356,356,"Everything would have been great, but we had to wait 20 minutes to get the check.",0
357,357,"Lobster @ market value, was overcooked and dry. The prime rib was excellent as was the creme brulee. Service was slow but friendly and somewhat attentive when they tried.",0
358,358,"It is so hard to review this particular visit to Dal Rae because it wasn't the normal experience that I'm use to.  Normally, we are seated in a big booth and have a wonderful time.  It was our anniversary and my sister-in-laws birthday, so I made reservations for 4 people and a booth.  On the way to the restaurant, I was told there would be someone else joining us.  Because we ended up with 5 at dinner, and it was prime dinner time on a Saturday night, we were seated in a back room with a large birthday party.  The party was so loud (and obnoxious at times), that we couldn't enjoy our conversation.  We were also set right next to the bussing station, so wait staff was in and out, clanking dishes right next to us all night.  Twice, the extra guest at the end of the table was hit in the head with the waiters tray as he was clearing other tables, and continually bumped by wait staff as they passed by.  Unfortunately, it was not the special experience we hoping for or use to for our special occasion.  That said, the food was amazing as usual.  The tableside preparation of the Caesar salad, the Steak Diane, and the tableside flambÃ© dessert, are in a league of their own!  I had been craving the Caesar Salad since the last time we had dined at Dal Rae.  The filet mignons, no matter which one you get, are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The price you pay for this fine dining experience is usually well worth it because you not only get fabulous, well prepared food, but you get a show with the old-school tableside preparations, and the wait staff is seasoned, professional, yet very friendly and accommodating.  Oh, and we love stopping at the piano bar and listening/dancing to oldies after dinner.  Even after this unfortunate experience, I can't wait to go back.  I will however, ask to be seated in the main dining room and not in a back room and would suggest you do the same unless you have a very large party.",0
359,359,"It has been over 20 years since I have dined at Dal Rae. It was a family favorite back in the day, a lovely surprise because of the location. The restaurant is a bit run down now, and the dining room is very crowded and smaller. We moved to the bar area after terrible awkward service in the dining room.  The bar area has great bartenders, TV's with sports on, and live music. Much more festive and quaint. The food was like any steakhouse. It is too bad the restaurant has lost it's old school charm.",1
360,360,"Pros and cons seemed equal for my first visit. Made reservation through Open stable and still had a 30min wait, ridiculous. Service at the bar and table was excellent. Food was okay. I had a wedge salad, yum, and crab cakes. The sauce for the crab cakes was horrible. It just didn't work. Normally I send things back, but I was full from the wedge and bread. My husband had the bland and chunk-less lobster bisque (not worth the calorie count) and bone-in rib eye. That steak saved the night. Best steak I have ever put in my mouth. Husband loved it. 
Other things...
Valet parking quick and easy.
Piano player was excellent and she had a really pretty voice. She's in the back of the bar and her performance is projected into the restaurant, a very nice touch.
The Malbec was delish.
They have black napkins if you need them.",0
361,361,Dal Rae is one of my favorite restaurants but Saturday night was service and food was way below what we usually get. We were celebrating our 34th anniversary with my brother and his wife. The service was not great (we had a new guy) and my brothers meal was undercooked and sent back 3 times. They finally took it off the bill but it's not any fun when everyone else is waiting for them to bring the new dish and our food gets cold. They even took back all of our meals at one point. I was truly disappointed this time. We came all the way from Riverside too ðððð,0
362,362,"For our anniversary, I took my wife to dinner. We were helped by an older lady who didnât seem like she was too happy to be serving that day. I get itâs Valentineâs Day, but I still expect some kind of service when the menu is only $80 per person plus drinks and appetizers if you choose. She took my drink order and then when my wife asked, âWhat kind of Moscatos go you haveâ the waitress replied with mojito flavors like mango and spearmint classic. We asked again if those were the types of moscatos and she replied, â yes sweetie, thatâs why it told you the first timeâ We agreed that Mango option would be a good try at something sweet so she picked it. After getting my drink which tasted like rubbing alcohol and my wifeâs drink was just as bad with a hint of mango, we asked our server about our drinks. I said I would get a coke and she commented, â too strong for you honey?â And when my wife mentioned the moscato, she said, â honey, you said mojito, not moscatoâ and began arguing with her about what she said. After that we went for food and asked her to recommend the best steak. She did and proceeded to take my wifeâs order. She came back about 15 minutes later to tell me that my choice( her recommend) was no longer available. So then I asked for another recommend and I ordered the Steak Diane. This reminds me. The time from sit to drinks was an hour and fifteen minutes. Food took an hour and fourth five minutes. 3 hours just on waiting time. It was ridiculous. Again, I get Valentineâs Day, but no one else got it as bad as us. Well, after the amazing, delicious food, we got the check and left. This is the recap from the first time. Not the greatest, but our second trip here make it worth it to come back.",1
363,363,"This is the 2nd time I came to Dal Rae with same opinion. The food is good, but not something to get that excited over. For the price, this place is way over rated. Tons of places offer a much better quality, for way less price. For the price of over $300.00 for 2 people splurging, what a waste. You cant cram another chair in this place, as your back will be bumping against the guest behind you, and very loud clanking and talking all around. Not really romantic at all, however the guy playing live music gave the people in the bar area all his energy which was more ""pretty cool"" than ""soothing atmosphere"" which was the best part of the dinner. In a word this place was just ""meeeh"". Sorry Dal Rae I gave it 2 chances.",1
364,364,I was pretty disappointed with my last visit. I didn't see a note regarding the limited Valentine's Day menu (even though it was the Saturday before) when making my reservation. It was an over priced pre fixe menu and the food just wasn't up to par. There were also some minor housekeeping issues that shouldn't occur in a restaurant of this caliber.,0
365,365,"I was not thrilled with the set valentines menu, service was very slow,  drinks were watered down, and it was expensive which I don't mind at all, buying this case,  I felt it was over priced for what the food and service was.",0
366,366,"It had been a few years since we dined at Dal Rae. Since then they have packed as many tables as you can fit into the restaurant and bar. I had to wait several minutes just to go to the bathroom because I could not get out of the booth we were seated in because the servers were serving the table next to us and blocking my path. The food is excellent. The noise level is high. I would go back again, but not on a weekend.",0
367,367,"The food is always good here, especially their specials. There is not a lot of room for movement which can cause staff to knock things around on their tables with their hips. At times because of space it felt tense and chaotic which is not something you expect at almost $50/ plate. In general, we tend to have a good experience here. But this last visit, the table next to us were making a lot of derogatory racial remarks which was not something we certainly wanted to hear while eating dinner. It is also very volumous in noise level so do not expect quiet.",0
368,368,"Been coming here for years, staple in the community. Love the food! But the service was mediocre. Server forgot a few things at the table.  And the girl that answered the phone was rude when I told her we were going to be 10 min late due to traffic, and when we arrived the same lady was rude to our faces. And when we left she didn't even acknowledge us. She was busy talking to another employee. Normally we are greeted with a smile and we love Dal Rae it's  old school old money that makes this place. But if they want a fresh new crowd for the future then they best get New and vibrant employees who actually want to work. And give good customer service so customers come back. We were there on 1/26 around 730. :/",0
369,369,"Went here for dineLA but was kind of disappointed with the lunch selections. If memory serves me correctly, the price was also a bit higher than what was listed. I had the poor man's pepper steak as the entree and was a bit disappointed with it. The ground beef was kind of mushy tasting which was probably better than being dry. But the sauce didn't have the punch I was expecting from the peppercorns. The spear of romaine/Caesar salad was good but  the dessert was the thing that saved the meal. I had the gold brick sundae which had a lace cookie like basket and it was delicious! Even though we were full, we ate almost the whole thing. My husband ordered the shrimp scampi as the other entree but found it to be only mediocre. We had wanted the prime rib lunch which we had once before but found out that they only served it on Thursdays and Fridays. Oh well, we'll just have to go back on one of those days. The waitress was very friendly and helpful so the meal still was pleasant, just not fabulous.",0
370,370,"The New Years Eve special menu was a surprise and not worth the $100 per person charged.  Service was great, food was not.",0
371,371,Food was excellent,1
372,372,"It really pains me to write this review. We've been loyal customers of Dal Rae for 25 years, dining at least 4-6 times a year. The server we had was abysmal. She treated us like we were customers in a diner. Perfunctory and rude speech, calling us ""hon"" and ""sweetie"", mija and mijo, throwing the plates down in front of us, etc. She got my son's steak order wrong, and  then blamed us for the error. The food was fine, but the service was sub-par.",0
373,373,"My fourth visit to Dal Rae. The ""Pepper Steak"",  a filet mignon covered with pepper and cooked in a special sauce, was wonderfully tender and tasty. The baked potato was perfect. Vegetable appetizers were fresh and appealing. The calamari was overcooked and only mildly warm. Bread was soft but not warm. Butter was cold and hard. House cabernet was pleasantly mild and well blended. Desert pecan pie was unheated, and ice cream topping was extra. After dinner cappuccino was bland. Table was extremely small, making it difficult for the three of us to eat comfortably. Service was extraordinarily good; we arrived at opening, when  there were few other customers. Still, service was attentive throughout the meal. Noise level was moderate; close-by  revelers occasionally made talking difficult to hear. Menu was limited to a Holiday special, one page menu. Prices were outrageous, even for a special holiday menu; since our last visit, several years ago, prices for this holiday menu have risen about 250%. Absolutely a rip-off and indefensible. Overall, the prices caused the value of the experience to be only fair, greatly offsetting the otherwise excellent food and outstanding service. Dal Rae needs to get its prices in line with reality, enlarge its tables for customer comfort, and take other small changes such as warming toast and offering soft, spreadable butter. Keep the great filet mignon, however. Finally, parking is by valet only.",0
374,374,The food was good but I can get food just as good in a lot of places and not be forced to pay for parking or sit in a booth with sunken seats.  They need to upgrade their furniture and give you the option to park your own car.  Will not return.,0
375,375,"The place is old and established, which is a good attribute.  The food however is lackluster.  The dishes have not kept up and the quality of the cooking is inferior.",0
376,376,"The food was outstanding as usual. But the server (Jackie) had her mind on other things. She was preoccupied with others or things and not attentive at all. Her assistant was worse. He never stopped at our table the entire night and he should have. We were in constant need of having waters refilled, drinks sitting empty, and such. Her other tables were somewhat neglected by her but at least her assistant helped on occasion. Just not with our table. Overall, the tables are far too close for quiet dinners and conversation. This place was very loud with ladies shouting over the din. Perhaps they had a little too much alcohol. It was not nice and not acceptable by my standards. Will we return? Yes but not soon.",0
377,377,"The place itserlf is just wonderful.  Service - Excellent
Loved everything but my entree  [Lamb Chops] 
Lamb Chops served raw [ordered Medium] they recooked said entree and returned to me 
Manager gave me a piece of pecan pie for my trouble - he was very charming BUT never enjoyed pie because...I became very ill the next 3  day - not sure if it was this or something else but i sure hated life for a while",0
378,378,"Love this long established restaurant.  Service was average, food was average and just a bit off tonight.  Some aspects of our experience were very good, yet typically everything, from start to finish is perfection on prior visits.  Tonight, not so much.  I am going to chalk this up to an 'off night'.",1
379,379,"We were celebrating a friends belated birthday due to the fact her youngest son passed away around her August birthday and subsequent funeral. That is one reason I wanted it to be extra special for her plus within past 18 months her husband, son-in-law and now son all passed away which is extremely hard for her. We both worked at the Northrop Grumman plant near you and loved to visit your fine establishment from time to time.  
Carole ordered the same option as I did, the chopped salad ,and found it to contain more blue-cheese that she was accustomed too. I had forgotten about the dressing.  She should have ordered your famous Monte Christo instead but wanted to try something different. Therefore, I was disappointed and sad that she didn't speak up and change her order. I wanted this to be a fun and tasteful birthday lunch.  
Thank you for your time and for my lunch.",1
380,380,We will be back because of the food but the service was INCREDIBLY SLOW although everyone was nice.,1

382,382,"The Dal Rae restaurant once noted as a fine dining steakhouse has seen its days. The appetizers (calimari and shrimp cocktail) were tasteless heaps. Same goes for the steaks. Although large portions, missing was the flavor, a sign of poorer quality food.",0
383,383,"The place and prices are overrated for the quality of the food and the location.  I take clients out to lunches & dinners all the time in LA and Beverly Hills, and was expecting this place to be of the same/comparable level, but I was very disappointed.  I don't mind paying top dollar as long as the quality of the food is good.  We were celebrating my brother's birthday and he lives a city away, so we looked online for a local fine dining restaurant. The best thing we had was the seafood platter, but otherwise, the food was so-so:  the frog legs had almost no flavor, and the rest of the entrees were like family diner quality.  The place itself could use some renovation; it's very old style.  The servers were nice and friendly but look like they've been instructed by management to rush people in and out.",0
384,384,The food was good but not really exceptional. It's not a great place for a vegetarian either....very meat heavy.....In general our whole party felt the prices were high for the service and food.  It took a long time to get greeted at the table and get a wine list...we grabbed one from the next table out of frustration....took an even longer time to take our order.  Never was asked how is everything during the main course....water refilled upon asking....the evening was OK ...nothing too memorable about the meal.  And the individual wrapped small bread sticks in the bread basket are tacky for what this restaurant is trying to be.,0
385,385,"I was told about Dal Rey by a friend who said it was a gem.  We had 730pm reservations but were put on the patio which does not have the ambiance that the restaurant does.   That was disappointing.   I was surprised how expensive the dishes were even with the mediocre sides included.  Rice Pilaf?  Really.  

The reason to go to Dal Rey is for the meat though.  My filet which was over 3 inches high and wide could be cut with that butter knife.  My husband had the lamb chops which were amazing.  

Beware that the peppercorn rub is not that at all.  It is a stack of green onions, bacon and some peppercorns.  My son scraped it off, as he does not like onions.  They should actually re-name the rub as the Dal Rey signature rub which would be more truth in advertising.  

All in all, the meat was good but not sure it was worth the drive and expense.",0
386,386,The service was excellent.  The value left a lot to be desired.   I have had just as good a steak (maybe better) at the steak house in La Mirada for half the cost.,1
387,387,"After driving 40 minutes to the restaurant the wait time with a reservation was extreme, instead of waiting for seating in the main room, I decided to take a booth in the bar area.

388,388,I was very disappointed that the banquet menu was not disclosed on the website.  I had no idea it would be that pricy.   I expected to pay the regular menu prices which was what was disclosed.  When I mentioned the incident to the waitress she just apologized but didn't try to change anything or make it better.,0
389,389,"we were seated within  minutes of arrival, we were seated in a back room which looked like the over flow area, I was not happy about this, we had our heart set on specific items from the menu and once we were seated we learned it was a set menu, and our items were not listed, I would definitely go back but just not on Valentines.",1
390,390,A super restaurant with great food.  Super steak. We love the relish tray and the bread are great.,1
391,391,"I had reservations for 6pm. We were seated after 630pm,only if I shared a booth with 2 other ladies. The Caesar salad was supposed to be made at the table. It wasn't because of too many guests. It took forever for the entree. The food was 5 stars,though. I had mentioned that it was my wife's birthday on the reservation. They never acknowledged her. I would eat there again, but never on a weekend night.",0
392,392,"I've dined at the Dal Rae about a half dozen times.  Being that it's about a 70 mile drive, each time was a celebration of a special occasion.  This visit was no different.

However, this experience was a bit of a disappointment.  My girlfriend's butterflied filet mignon was undercooked, and my bone-in ribeye was under cooked also.  What's more, this happened even after an extensive conversation with our sever.  He was very inquisitive about how we liked our meat prepared.  Additionally, both steaks were under seasoned, too.

As usual though, the table side Ceasar for two, prepared by John, was out of this world.",0
393,393,"I love the Dal Rae on a regular basis. However Christmas Eve was such a disappointment . We had a horrible table at the entrance of the dining room. Everyone and their mother elbowed, bumped or pushed us during the evening.

I had asked for a particular server and she happened to have the worse tables. When I asked for something else, they offered to sit us outside in the patio area..that was not an option so we stayed.

The service was uptight and stressful. The menu was limited and they didn't have some of the items I was looking forward to having. I couldn't of imagined the evening would be that way. 

Had I known ahead of time I would have stayed home and cooked. The idea to spend a holiday there was my mistake.  Expensive evening and not pleasurable.",0
394,394,I love this restaurant and spend every one of my birthdays there. But sorry to say the service was off that night.,1
395,395,"Dal Rae is a local tradition. It was chosen for that reason. Not much has changed here in thirty years, and that's all to the good. Downsides are the prices, which always have been, and continue to be, out of proportion to the quality of food, and the management's tendency to over crowd all of the restaurant 's floor space. There is still a rug on the floor at Dal Rae, but you will be eating so close to the other diners, that conversation across your table will be difficult.",0
396,396,"My best friend and her family have dined here for decades. This was always a family favorite for delicious food and a lovely, quiet, old school dining experience. 

Last night we came to celebrate my best friend's birthday. I specified,on open table, that this was a birthday celebration and that we would like one of their best tables. I actually called to confirm the good table and special birthday was being celebrated.

We arrived 10 minutes early and we're dressed in lovely clothing. They took us to our table....in a stuff corner at the opening to the booming bar, facing the bus boy station. The hotess disappeared before we could speak. We went back to the hotess stand and I expressed my total disapproval of the table and reiterated the requests that I made when I made the reservation. They seated us at the next  table, 6 feet from the first, still with the bar but out of the line of site of the bus station.

Food was delicious and the service was acceptable. The prices are high but the food is scrumptious. I will never come here for a quiet, celebratory dining experience because it does not offer that anymore. If you want to drop 75+ per person, with a booming bario atmosphere, then the Dal Rae is for you. If you ate seeking lively, old school ambience and flare...go to The Summit House in Brea or The Derby in Arcadia.",0
397,397,"Love this place, however, visited on Father's Day and food was good but not great. That day, they had caesar salad available although it was not made fresh at your table side like it usually is. The salad tasted a little fishy (maybe too much anchovies) and lettuce did not look as fresh. As an entree, I ordered the Monterey Chicken with Rice Pilaf. Chicken was ok. Rice pilaf very blan.",0
398,398,"I've been to Dal Rae several times in the past.  I have always enjoyed the food and the service was always good.  This last time I went there (with a work client) the service was not very good.

401,401,"We had a reservation, yet were seated 45 minutes late.  And, this is the second time this has happened.  The manager explained they were really busy because it was DineLA week.  So, you can't manage your reservations even with extra tables crammed into every little open spot?  What's the point?  Once seated the experience was good, but tarnished by the long wait and manager's lame response.  I will avoid this restaurant during future special events like DineLA.",0
402,402,"Not meant as a put-down but on a recent business trip I was stunned a bit by the lack of finer restaurants in the area. Yes, you have choices 10 miles to the west, but traffic is a quagmire, so something close is pretty intriging. We dined as Steven's the first night, but the so-so experience compelled us to seek something close that idnt require freeway access. We found Dal Rae. Similar steakhouse a bit past its prime but the experience was still pretty decent. Steaks were good and sides held up well. Service was excellent. My standards tend to scale with what the area has to offer and Dal Rae met those expectations.",0

404,404,"The drinks are terrible probably the worst I've ever had, never again will I get a drink there.  That said the food is very good, and I will definitely return.",0
405,405,"Four of us had dinner together. Made reservation several days in advance. Had a drink in the bar which was very nice. The atmosphere was very relaxing. The bar tender was most attentive.

The restaurant felt a little crowded, several larger parties at the time. The table that we were sat at was really to small for 4 people, perhaps three at the most. The food was good and the service was timely.",0
406,406,This was our first time dinning at this restaurant.Our server Jacki was very helpful and attentive all night.Please send her our thanks.The lighting in the room was a bit too dark.Hard to read the menu even with the candle light on the table.We had to use our cell phones for lighting.No New Castle beer or Mojito mix drink available. The wheat bread and butter were a bit on the cold side.,0
407,407,"Very busy Tuesday night, waitress had no clue about the wines, the Ceaser Salad was dreadful. The main course was really good for all five of us, very pricy and not really worth the money. Years ago this restaurant was exceptional, maybe we just got a bad night. Won't be returning anytime soon.....",1
408,408,The steak was as good as it gets but the service was average at best.,1
409,409,"The way it was... and only sometimes still is. Great personal service. Spot on martini's, good table side Caesar, Prime rib fine but pepper steak served med well - not medium rare as ordered and cold. Sat around waiting?",0
410,410,Okay. Not worth the money though. The service was great but the food was a miss.,1
411,411,"This is the second time I've gone to the Del Rae for dinner in the last 6 months.   Both times it was crowded and this last time was the worse. The waitress was very busy and she seemed to be very impatient.   When my wife asked a question,  she gave a very stern look like ""hurry up"".  This is not a Low Price restaurant and you will pay a good penny for dinner.  However,  what you pay versus the service you get is not worth it.  Go to Lawry's or even Steak and Stein for a better experience.   Food was good but there are many other places where you can get a great steak and better atmosphere.  The owner was on the floor but he seems to cater to the regulars in the back so don't expect him to stop by your table.",0
412,412,"First time dining at Dal Rae, arrived and hostess seemed perplexed at where to seat us although we did have reservations. After talking to another employee, they decided on a table & led us to a 6 person booth with a couple on one end & us at the other. Not cool, especially when there were 2 other open tables. Should have refused then but we decided to go with the flow. Took about 10 minutes for our waitress to show up; she seemed tired and service lagged throughout the night. The food was excellent-peppercorn steak very tender & Chilean seabass was huge, a GranMarnier souffle finished the meal, but not worth a return trip from the overall experience. At least we can say we tried it & cross it off our dining list.",0
413,413,"My husband and I brought my parents too the Del Ray 15 years ago when we were just dating we later married and been busy with life that we wanted too revisit where it all began, the one thing that stayed with my husband was the spinish salad they make table side well unfortunatly we got it but our waitress didn't make it tableside which was a downer and one of the reasons it brought us back too the restaurant.. All n all we had a romantic evening the service was a bit slow but it was a full house I'll be back hope diff waitress.",1
414,414,"I gave them three stars only because the food was good.  At first, our server forgot one of our drinks and it took her a while to finally get back to us so we could let her know.  Our entree's took just over ONE HOUR to finally come out.  The server kept coming to our table letting us know ""our food should be out shortly..."" So she knew it was taking a long time as well.  When my filet finally arrived it was over cooked but I wasn't going to send it back knowing how long it took to get this one.  They also forgot our coffee during our dessert.  This was our first time there and the whole family was dissapointed especially on such an important day.   It was mother's day at 2PM.  The restaurant was a little less than half full at that time.",0
415,415,"Always enjoy the Dal Rae for lunch or dinner. The food always superb, usually the service is excellent, not so this day. Disappointed the birthdays were not acknowledged.",0
416,416,I was disappointed that I orderd table side preparation and it was not preformed at our table . The restaurant was not crowded so I'm not sure why they couldn't prepare food as advertised . I had steak Diane the meat was very tender but very under cooked. Also got a message from open table asking why I hadn't honored my reservation.,0
417,417,"Service was great. Unfortunately, the filet mignon and the gargantuan lobster tail were overcooked and bland in taste. I' 've had better meals there on previous visits.",0
418,418,"Don't try the crab stuffed mushrooms, the flavor was a bit odd, didn't care for what the hollandaise and lemon flavored sauce on the mushroom. The rest of our food was delicious. We had the cesar salad which was prepared in front of us from scratch. The peppered steak which was cooked to perfection, medium rare. For dessert we had the Cherries Jubilee, very delicious and they flambe the cherries in front of us too. The best part however was the pickels that are brought to the table with radishes and carrots. We even asked for a second helping of the pickels. Our waiter was great and attentive. The host that brought us to our table did not notice that their was only place settings for one, and we had to ask for the bread plate and fork.",0
419,419,"We have dined at the Dal on numerous occasions over the past 15 years and this was the first time I have ever had a problem with the service. Our reservations through Open Table were at 7:00. When we arrived, we were told 7:30. After I received the pager, I checked my emails to confirm 7:00. I showed my email to the hostess. She said ""Oh, we're running behind and you'll be seated at 7:30."" Why didn't they just say that in the first place. Also, after we finished our salad course, it took more than 15 minutes before our plates were cleared. The table service was very slow that evening. However, the food was still excellent !",0
420,420,I go to Del Rae about 6 times a year. This past time we were there we felt rushed to leave. We had only been there an hour when the waitress asked if we needed any food packed and gave us the bill. I am not sure if we will return.,1
421,421,"From our arrival to our seating it was outstanding, but our assigned waiter continued to disappear and out of sight for very long periods of time. It was a hopeless feeling not being able to get our drinks refilled. Our dinner took longer than usual to arrive, but considering it was Valentine's evening, it was expected. We have never experience being abandoned by our waiter and is the first. We will continue to be loyal customers of Dal Rae because we LOVE their steaks!",0
422,422,"Food was phenomenal , everything everyone promised it would be. The service however definitely left something to be desired, although my wife and I were promptly seated, we were asked to move to another table twice. We probably waited 10mins for menus and server not, what I'd expect from such a highly recommend establishment. Im hoping because it was on such a busy day service was so poor and not a regular accurance. All and all a decent experiance.",1
423,423,"I ordered their ""famous peppercorn"" steak --with peppercorn sauce. It was not anything at all like traditional peppercorn sauce and had bacon in it. The steak was tender and delicious, but would have been better without their version of peppercorn sauce. It was easy enough to scrape off, but I was disappointed as I had set my mind to having some really good peppercorn sauce. Service was nice and friendly.",0
424,424,"The Dal Rae is a quality Old School Steak House. The menu will not blow your socks off, but the quality of the food is good and classically prepared. It is very similar to The Derby in Arcadia.",1
425,425,"Too pricey for the quality of food. Drinks were excellent but how can you mess up scotch on the rocks?
Will go again but stay at the bar.",1
426,426,"We've heard about this place numerous times after having moved in the area. We finally decided to come through Dine LA week and ordered their classic petite filet, minestrone with chicken soup, stuffed crab mushrooms, creme brulee and ice cream sundae. There was quite a bit of a wait, even with reservations. A much older atmosphere and a bit loud.

Service was nothing over the top to make our dinner any more memorable, but they did their job and were friendly.
Food was not something memorable. The filet came out a bit dry and heavy loaded with their house onion/bacon/other greens chooped on top. Not being an onion fan, they taste was a bit overwhelming.

It's a must-go for its history, but would not be one of our go-to places for steak.",0
427,427,"The hostess who seated us was very rude. When I informed her that I had a reservation she looked me up and down and said, ""uh-huh"". This is not the first time this hostess has been rude to guests at this establishment. She is old and tired and looks like she hates her job. I work in customer service and there's no way I would allow my employees it treat customers in this manner. It's a shame because I really enjoy the food and ambiance at Dal Rae but this old hag really needs to go. Management needs to get someone new and energetic and respectful to work in the front of this restaurant. After all, the hostess is the first impression the customer sees when coming to dine.",0
428,428,"Great service. Loved the old style relish tray on ice and the generous bread basket. The breading on the Calamari was without any salt, pepper or spices and too bland. The house special, Chilean Sea Bass, was great. The peppered steak was not enjoyable to me because it had green onion and other ingredients on it where I prefer just cracked black pepper. The steak itself was very tender and good. The cheese cake with fresh berries was outstanding. We will go back.",0
429,429,The food was good and service was good but the waitress was a bit aloof. The idea of making salads and desserts at the table is a bit old and it created a pinch point for staff to get past. The manager/owner came to the table but did not seem interested. Service could be a bit better. Recommend it but ask for a table away from main pathways.,1
430,430,Loved the food and our waitress... but not the service at the bar! The bartender was very rude!,0
431,431,"We have been coming here for years. Family favorite. The hostess was in a hurry and walked ahead of us and never even waited for us to catch up. She put the menu's on the table and walked away. I asked to be seated away from the kitchen and any bus stations. So where do they seat us? In front on the kitchen and in front of the bus station. I made our reservations a month in advance and when I said something the hostess said ""We can't guarantee anything during the holidays"". The baked scallops cava de oro has been our favorite but when it arrived the sauce was broken and it did not taste as good as in the past. My prime rib was delicious and so was the poached Salmon. For the price, they need to step it up.",0
432,432,"We just celebrated our anniversary here. The food was superb. We loved the filet mignon pepper steaks. The presentation was great. The Rock Shrimp appetizer was wonderful. But, the tables were squeezed so closely together that it didn't seem like a private celebration.

The service was forgettable. Slow and unattentive. We had to wait between 10-15 minutes each time for the waitress to come and see how we were doing. So, the coffee cups sat empty much of the evening. Even when she came, she didn't notice that we needed anything. I had to ask her to refill water, coffee, butter, etc many times. She didn't seem to notice us at all.

Overall, we like the place and will return because the food is so much better here than anywhere else.",0
433,433,"Del Rae is one of my favorite places for going back to the late 50's or 60's! The restaurant is a ""feedback"" to those times in the past where elegant dining was something to appreciate. The servers, the food, the ambience are all indicative of good times past.
Will go back again and again! Good memories from the past.",1
434,434,"After being told about this place for years, my wife and I decided to try it for my birthday. Overall, it was not a bad experience, but everything was overpriced....well overpriced. I know it's an old school place, but what you pay for and what you get was not commensurate with other fine dining restaurants. That being said, the wait staff was friendly and courteous. The best part of the night was my steak - it was actually pretty good and I'll go back for that when the time calls.",0
435,435,"I chose the Dal Rae to celebrate my birthday with my wife and children. I was disappointed that the valet was understaffed and then we waited over 50 minutes for our table with a reservation. In addition, it seems like they've packed extra tables so that the table side preparations the restaurant is known for were not possible.",0
436,436,"The surf and turf was delicious; the decor is something out of an old folks home. It was dark and i needed help reading the menu. We dressed up thinking it was an upscale place with a dress code but people were there in ball caps, others in shorts and sneakers. Our server was great with the perfect amount of attentiveness. There was a gentleman going around talking at different tables trying to be funny, he was very annoying... the server said it was the owner. I might have given it a four star if i didnt have to put up with this! I checked this place off my list, i won't go back.",1
437,437,"will definitely return as it is best restaurant in the area. menu is a throwback to the 1980s, but that works for it.",1
438,438,Del Rae over charged me for salads.  We had 6 guests and they charged for 8 salads.  Have not had the time to contact them for reimbursement.,0
439,439,"Seated right away as we were late due to traffic. Very busy for Valentines Day crowd w/people waiting in the bar. Limited menu selections but so many excellent choices to choose from. Both of our meals were prepared just as we ordered w/I a timely manner. Service was prompt & professional. Only issue we noticed was the combination of music being played over the speakers & the live entertainment in the lounge. They really clashed making it hard to have a discussion w/o raising our voices. The full room & the loud dinner party next to us didnt help either.
We probably return but not on a holiday.",0
440,440,"Classic dinner and good. Drinks in the bar are generous, perhaps too generous.",1
441,441,We went for Dine LA Week and the food was lacking flavor.,1
442,442,"This was my 2nd visit to Dal Rae. My first visit was so FABULOUS, I decided to book reservations for New Years Eve. Overall everything was good, however I was disappointed on the seating location. We had reservations at 9:00pm and we were seated in the patio area (outside the dining room). I love the dining room. Had I known we were going to be outside in the patio, I may of reconsidered another restaurant and or changed my reservation time.",1
443,443,Food is great but service was very slow,0
444,444,Long wait for entree....over 30 minutes after salad,0
445,445,"Until 2 years ago, Dal Rae was a frequent favorite for unwinding with great wine, fabulous food, and impeccable service. After moving away, I've visited at least once every 6 months. This last visit it was sad to see that the wait staff has changed, and not for the better. First, no butter with the bread, we had to ask for the ordered coffee, dinner plates were left well after completed and set aside, and no crumb sweep. Highly unlike the Dal Rae service I knew and loved. Hopefully all will improve by the next visit.",0
446,446,Took a long time for our server to take our desert order,1
447,447,The waiters were rushing us into eating fast.,0
448,448,"First time in years I got a tough steak (bone-in rib eye)! The server offered to take them back but we decided it'll probably be the same tough (same cow?) and also very wasteful. The balsamic vinegar was overpowering on our wilted spinach salad and we couldn't finish it. I personally was disappointed as I have been going to Dal Rae for many years (25+) and brought an out of town guest(first visit)who was not impressed and said she wouldn't care to go again :-( I, on the other hand, live in the San Gabbriel Valley and would still go as it is one of my all time favorite restaurants and I like to think it was just not a bad night.",0
449,449,"This is the best in the Montebello/pico Rivera area, but can not compare to what you can get for the same price if you dine in LA or West LA.",1
450,450,"I took my Mom for her 80th birthday. The food was very good and so was our waiter. The only special request I had was not to be seated near a bus station or the kitchen. So I was pretty disappointed when they sat us right next to a bus station. I asked to sit one table over and the hostess let us know it was reserved. I said, well, I made reservations as well. I spoke with Marcie who was in charge at the front and all she wanted to do was argue and make excuses. This is not the tactful Dal Rae that I am used to. We came early, 6 pm too,so there were tables available. The marred what could have been a great experience.",0
451,451,"Although the restaruant has wonderful ambiance, our party of seven was put in a back room on a folding table. When booking the reservation on line I was unaware that they would tuck us away in a room that looked like it was a small banquet room. I had heard so much about the old school atmosphere. I wish they would have told us that we were not going to get to sit in the dinning room. We could have changed our reservation time.",0
452,452,"We have been dining here for many years. Last night we ordered the large prime rib cut for the 2 of us. We ordered it medium to medium rare. What we got was a badly overcooked prime rib. It had no color, it was not an end-cut but a center cut. The meat was good but should have been served. We debated about sending it back but did,nt have time having show reservations.",0
453,453,"The food was very good. The bread (the 'regular' and the cheese bread) were excellent!Service was very good and we had very friendly and efficient waitress and service staff.
I found the restaurant to be very crowded and therefore, noisy. We had a table in the middle of an aisle and another table was later added behind our table. It was placed right up to our table so that it was almost impossible for one of our party to get out of her chair. Two of our chairs were 'small' and uncomfortable. We were first given a table that was right next to the kitchen door so I said I did not want it. We were given a different table, one 'over' so not quite so bad. Since we had a reservation for several days I thought that would ensure better.",0
454,454,"Although the food was good, the service was semi-attentive, it was busy with many parties and we felt rushed to get out.",0
455,455,Well I made my reservations through open table but at Del Rae didn't my reservations. This has never happened before - thank god I had my confirmation email..... But even after showing it to the host she said it didn't matter cuz it wasn't in her computer. she finally gave us a square beeper and we had to wait.,1
456,456,"The food was excellent and was beyond expectations.. Better than Morton's or Ruth Chris.
The table service needs polishing. The mixed drinks didn't meet the same standard as the meal and the wine glasses were spotty and cheap. Made a reservation at 8pm and yet still had to wait until 830pm to be sited.
Loved the ambient the place is romantic and has its own unique feel to it. Will go back again for the food just hope the service and glasses they serve wine better.",0
457,457,"This was the first time I've been to Dal Rae. The food was good but not great. The service was very good, as for ambiance, we were seated in a small patio room which was not as nice as I expected for Dal Raes reputation. I live in the area and have been to Clearmans as well. If I had to choose, Steak and Stein wins out every time.",0
458,458,"Had to wait almost 40 mins to be seated even though we had a reservation. We had to squeeze by other tables, wait staff, etc. to get to our booth. Food had its highs and lows. My filet mignon pepper steak was delicious! I can see why people rave about it. Their version of Greek Salad and Penne Arriabata on the other hand was extremely poor. I have found better renditions at the Food Court at the mall. The Veal Piccata was decent yet very small portions in comparison to other dishes. Aside from the steak I thought based on the quality of the plates they were way overpriced. Drinks and wine were very good. Overall, only come if you want steak. Seems the other stuff is just ""meh"".",0
459,459,"Food did not meet expectations. The prime ribs were fair despite reading great reviews. Best part of the meal was the baked potato. Disappointed by dessert, ordered flour less chocolate cake and you could see where the burnt edges had been cut off. Did not expect something cheesy like that from a restaurant of this supposed caliber.",0
460,460,"It would have been an outstanding evening, however for a reservation at 6:00 that we arrived 15 minutes early for did't happen until 7:oo. We weren't given a beeper until 6:30 and then had to go to the hostess several times to check. It was aggravating hearing that we were waiting on a table that was seated at 5:00 and our reservation was for 6:00. You can't possibly expect someone to take only and hour for dinner there. The highlight was our waitress who heard of our plight and took excellent care of us in an extremely timely manner!!!",0
461,461,"We waited for over 40 minutes for our table even though we had reservations. The food was good but not worth the price. A little bit overpriced for the quality. I might go back, but not sure.",1
462,462,Poor service. Extremely slow and unresponsive waitress. Prime rib was excellent. Wine list was adequate. Again don't know if they were short handed but it was unusually slow service . Frustrating.,0
463,463,"I enjoyed the piano bar while waiting for our table. This was our anniversary and the songs were member able classic oldies :)
The food was delicious and was served promptly and I loved our server she made us feel right at home.",0
464,464,"Some items were very good - the bread, the caeser salad, the sea bass. Some items were disappointing - the steak was dry; the halibut was dry. The vegetables on the plate looked frozen and silly for such a pricey place. The service was attentive. We were overall disappointed as the meal was expensive and the quality was disappointing in several dishes.",0
465,465,"I had not visited Del Rae since 1993, and it was just a I remember it. Excellent service and very good food. It was a bit nostalgic to visit a restaurant from so long ago.",1
466,466,"Great food. Great waitstaf. Great atmosphere. Horrible Hostesses. These two women one older, one middle aged blonde, are so unfriendly, curt, and downright rude to non regulars it is ridiculous. I come a few times s year to the Dal Rae and they ruin a flawless experience everytime! Time to replace these two with friendly happy people who enjoy their job...",0
467,467,"This is the best restaurant in the Montebello/Pico Rivera area for dates or special occasion. Having said that, don't expect food to be like what you'll find in the West LA area. It is good old American, huge serving, high calorie food, not your California/French refined food. If you know what to expect, you will enjoy the food here. If you are a petite person, you will have left overs for next day's lunch. Go hungry & enjoy!",0
468,468,"One of our favorite spots....service, slow, messy stacking of dishes by busboys....always teetering to fall on guests....just not a professional staff anymore..... has declined over the years, it used to be terrific service....but food is always excellent, and a couple of table captains are great....but attention by them is too infrequent. FOOD is GREAT, however!",0
469,469,"Upon entering, the restaurant smelled, like old Pine Sol however it dissipated.
Also, it was too crowded to enjoy or be part of our tableside made dessert.
Our entire meal was delicious and the food quality is high.",1
470,470,"Old-fashioned supper club atmosphere, with good service, tasty food, and an obvious sense of pride in its tradition. The meals may be a bit heavy for those not used to the type, but if you like interesting restaurants with a bit of nostalgia, you won't go wrong here.",1
471,471,"This restaurant has been a family favorite of ours for years. My grandparents have frequented this place since the 60's and this is where my grandparents even celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. Now if you want a nice place to eat dinner or to celebrate a special occassion then the Dal Rae is a the place to go; however, be aware that it is a bit pricey so be prepared to spend some cash when eating here. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE my Dad and I made this weekend. We both ordered the lobster and the waitress informed us that they were out of the ""Big Tail"" and if we would mind 2 smaller ones. My Dad and I both said yes and then they handed us the bill of $120 per plate instead of the $64 quoted on the menu.",0
472,472,The food was not the quality that we were use to. The menu was not as extensive as in the past. We did not get value received for the cost.,1
473,473,"We waited for 45 minutes after our reservation time before we were seated, then another 45 minutes before our dinner were served. The dining area is very crowded, table arrangements were very close to each other. This restaurant is certainly not what I expected or what the ratings suggested. The signature pepper steak was good, but rest of the selection were quite ordinary.",0
474,474,"Good was very good. Very noisy and energetic. Tables are too close together. Felt very ""crowded"". GREAT service.",1
475,475,Do not order Lobster Thermidor because they do not have any idea on how to make it right. You will be disappointed.,1
476,476,A bit pricey for what it was. Still quite good.,1
477,477,I went there to celebrate a friends birthday and they totally forgot about it. I left a note on the reservation that we were there to celebrate a birthday and they did nothing. NOT A PLACE FOR CELEBRATING BIRTHDAYS....,0
478,478,"This place is a good enough old school steak house with a nice ambience if that is what you are looking for. Problem I have is everytime I have gone there (4-5 times) they play the same game when you come in. Its always ""your table is being made up right now, why dont you go to the bar and we'll call you in a few minutes"". The few minutes is always 45 minutes (and +$40.00 at the bar)later. If the table is being readied right then it shouldn't take another 45 minutes. Each time I have had to go back to the hostess before our little buzzer buzzed. One time our server apologized and said the appetizers would be on the house due to the wait and when the bill came they had taken nothing off. Food isn't bad but feel they play too many games.",0
479,479,"Food is excellent, service was terrible. But this is not the first time we have encountered this with Dal Rae. If they had better service we would frequent the restaurant more often. But waiting over an hour for your dinner is a bit ridiculous. Add a 30 minute wait just to place the order....etc.. Point made",0
480,480,"This establishment has been around for quite some time for a number of reasons. Tonight, our food was truly outstanding. The scampi was nicely prepared; the caesar salad, the best -- prepared tableside. The lamb chaps, par excellence. So, why what was going on with the surly service. Downright cold. Maybe the holiday season wasn't kind to everyone, but please don't take it out on your customers who are spending significant dollars for a wonderful meal.",0
481,481,"Apparently Dal Rae is a very popular place for office Christmas parties. There were so many of them there that they were using a reduced holiday menu and the staff was noticeably worn out. It also took a long time to be seated because people were opening gifts at the tables and slowing things down. I don't blame the restaurant for any of this, but next time I will definitely go at a different time of year. On the plus, the food was terrific, and the holiday decorations were certainly pretty.",1
482,482,"So it's a Friday and the traffic is not good, we weren't going to make our resevations, we called to let them know we were close but running a little behind. I think they gave our table away. We got there 15 minutes after our reservation and we ended up waiting about 30 mins. The nice thing is it didn't seem like they were rushing out any patrons so people really did enjoy themselves. We were sat and promptly given chilled vegetables and bread. Our server along with the rest of the staff was very attentive. We were out there for the Dine LA week and both went with the menu. Appetizers were good for both our selections but I was disappointed with their signature pepper steak, too much sauce on the steak but otherwise overall good.",0
483,483,Service was not up to usual excellent standard.,1
484,484,"Food was great, but service was not what I expected from a fine restuarant. Food arrived at our table approximately 50 minutes after I ordered it. Manager was kind though and made things a bit better once I spoke to him about the matter. I may visit again.",0
485,485,"The wait staff were attentive an responsive. The Caesar Salad prepared tableside was delicious, ihe best salad course I have had in the last 10 years. Oysters Rockefeller were tender, tasty, not overpowering. The disappointment came with the Lobster Thermidor. Boiled to death, lobster chunks sat in their split shell in a puddle of water, which pulled all of the nutty, firm flavor and texture out of the meat, while diluting the flavor of the casserole blend. The chocolate souffle dessert made me forget the shortcomings of the main course.",0
486,486,"This restaurant has been the ""special occasion"" place for my family for 3 generations now and it's always been a great experience. I was dissapointed on my last 2 visits however simply because the lobster was a bit overcooked and rubbery. It wasn't the melt-in-your-mouth goodness that I've always known. This will not deter me from visiting again, but I will certainly order something else instead.",0
487,487,I was a lttle disappointed this time. We ordered Lobster at $52.00 a piece and it was just OK not like I remebered from previous dinning experiences.,1

489,489,The food as always was pretty good ... however the service was not up to Dal Rae standards. We did not recieve the normal vegtable tray along with not receving any cheese bread with our dinner.,0
490,490,We felt sorry for the service staff. By 6:15pm the tables were packed so closely together that it seemed impossible to provide the service desired for this very expensive meal. Surely the local fire marshal would disapprove.,1
491,491,"I thought I would be underdressed, because the website made the place look trendy, but a nice surprise when I arrived. A throwback to times when lunch was a 2-hour affair. Definitely will go there again.",1
492,492,"The service was attentive. The booth were high enough for privacy. The server interrupted only when needed. The food was presented attractively. We ordered rock shrimp as an appetizer. Tender, not overcooked, and beautiful in its tangy sauce. Next was a Caesar salad prepared by the owner himself at tableside. Then came a filet mignon pepper steak with a loaded baked potato. Half of the steak was not edible. Way too well done and dried out. It ruined the experience. Later when checking the bill against my credit card statement, I was charged $15 more than authorized by my signature. I had given a 20% tip but they wanted 35%! This is the 2nd time extra unauthorized charges have appeared from this restaurant. I may have had enough.",0
493,493,very generous pepper steak rules!!!!,1
494,494,Dining room had extra tables added making it very crowded....our tableside dining entrees could not be done tableside. Too cramped. Food is very good and service excellent.,0
495,495,"After reading all the reviews i was expecting a lot from the Del Rae. The food was good, not great and not worth the money. The service was better, not necessarily the waiter but the busboys. They were more active then the waitress. I do not know if i would go back with so many other high end steak houses in the LA/OC metro area. The atmosphere was pleasant and the restaurant looked nice, put me into a circa-1950's steakhouse.",0

After an excellent meal and service, we were forced to manuver thru a bar filled with people.
Very upsetting since I informed them of the wheelchair after I made the reservatrilon , on the internet.",1
500,500,"I think the restaurant caters to an older crowd...say 40+. The food is classic. They had great crabcakes! The duck which I ordered needed the alcohol to burn off a little more. The presentation was great. This is a place that definitely caters to an older crowd. If not for Dine LA or for OpenTable, I don't think you'd have so many younger clients coming in. Definitely somewhere to take your parents or in-laws.",0
501,501,"The food at Del Rae is consistently good, but this was my first time having a waitress who was marginal and eager to get my friends and I out the door.
I truly hope this is not the type of service I can expect from this point on as it might impact my decision to return.",0
502,502,"I have been eating at the Dal Rae for years and years.  Monday's lunch was not up to their usual standards at all.  I ordered the filet kabobs.  The filet had zero taste which tells me the cook did not season the meat at all, nothing.  The green beans were far too al dente for my taste.  I love the technique of blanching the veggies then shocking them in ice water, but those green beans needed about two minutes longer in the blanching process.  They had no spicy flat bread either.  Disappointing visit for sure.  The service, however, was outstanding.",0

507,507,"Food and service was great as always. Highlights were margaritas (well made), sashimi on toast with avocado, scallops and crab Louie salad. I would give 5stars but the table seating is just too packed. When we got up to leave, literally no aisle to get out. Finally a gentleman saw the struggle in our faces of which way to go and got up, moved his chair just so we could pass. Glad restaurant is busy but thatâs not safe nor easy for servers as well.",0
508,508,Traditional steak house with prime steaks and a great fish,1
509,509,"I have eaten at Dal Rae several times. Went for Mother's Day and discovered they have a limited menu. As our server stated, a normal day is 200 meals. This day is more than 400 meals, so we need people to eat and move along. Several items not on the menu such as the the wilted spinach salad and the dessert souffle. If you want those items, don't come on Mother's Day. Normally people dress for the restaurant. Men in ties and ladies in dresses. Men eating dinner inside while wearing baseball caps and ladies in tight jeans. Not the restaurants fault.  Will I be back? Absolutely. However, it won't be on a holiday.",0
510,510,Food was delicious as always. Service was pretty good considering how busy it was that night. Long line to get car from valet. What happened to the relish tray? It was one of my favorites.,1
511,511,Classic 1950s restaurant outstanding service great food.,1
512,512,"The occasion was for a birthday. First time to the restaurant. I found the price for the crab legs, a bit excessive compared to our favorite seafood restaurants.
I asked for my prime rib to accompany my crab legs, cooked medium to medium rare what I got was rare.",0
513,513,"Was excited to eat here again. I had been craving their chicken Monterey. This time for some reason wasnât what it was in the past. My chicken was sitting in grease, the hollandaise sauce was absent, and their was some sort of fishy flavor (Iâm not a fan of fish or seafood). My husbands sea bass was delicious. Our sides were great, the salad was yummy. Our drinks were great, I tried 3 different martinis and all were delicious. Our dessert was good. The service was wonderful. It was just my chicken sadly",0
514,514,"OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER WERE VERY GOOD BUT ON THE SMALL SIDE. ONION SOUP WAS VERY ORDINARY, WOULD NOT ORDER AGAIN. THE NEW YORK PEPPER STEAK WAS VERY GOOD AND COOKED PERFECTLY. CREAM BRULEE WAS OK",1
515,515,I prefer Dal Rae for lunch. Service is more attentive and personable. Always love the valets though!,1
516,516,"The environment and service was beyond excellent.  My issue was the New York steak (rare) was extremely chewy, lean, and the pepper style was a bit too much.  Practically half peppercorns chunks covered the top of the steak.  Of course just my opinion (I have eaten steak from more than 12 countries and all different recipes by country styles, but not that it really matters).  Not sure if I will ever order any of the beef entrees ever again.  A lot of their menu will sound too similar so emphasize what you order.  I ordered the Filet Mignon Creekstone Bone-in but got a center cap cut.  Definitely worth the experience though.  Give them a try.  Your experience may be different.",0
517,517,"Great service and great food. No complaints, the server Liz was awesome",1
518,518,"My 2nd time here.

Food: We had the Ribeye Cap, Bone-In Ribeye & Mac n Cheese. Now, compared to Mastros, Flemings, Mortons, Del Friscos and Ruth Chris this place is well below my standard and ranks last. But still on the scale. For the pricing they have id chose mastros or mortons as they are fairly similar.

Wait time: Too long for even the Caesar salad to come.

Ambiance: Old school, vintage decor & booths. The tables are so close to each other that people coming & going kept turning sideways, not to mention the servers bumping Into the table. The place exemplifies maximizing space. I saw the busser go around two times around the tables to try and bring my ice tea. The music from the bar was too loud for the primary dining room, but if I was in the bar, it would be a vibe.

Service: Attentive and informative. But, too busy to pay close-close attention. And I say this because we went without refills for longer then I would say to be normal.",0
519,519,Great food but a bit overpriced,1
520,520,"One of my favorites. This time around, things weren't as good as before. Everyone  is entitled to a bad day",1
521,521,The food was excellent although my prime rib was at least 1/3 fat.,0
522,522,"I love the Dal Rae and have been going there for decades.  This is the first time I was not satisfied with my meal.  I ordered the shrimp scampi for lunch.  It did not have enough flavor, and the shrimp was small.  It came with asparagus.  It was not enough food to satisfy.  If I had not ordered an appetizer, I would have still been hungry.  If you want scampi, go to the Derby.  Their shrimp tastes better, is larger and satisfying.",0
523,523,"The food was great. The service was okay, it did take about 1 hr to receive our food including the appetizers. Felt like it couldâve been better but overall food and place was nice.",1
524,524,MY FAVORITE RESTURANT FOR PRIME FOOD.  THE BESTS BLUE CHEESE DRESSING.,1
525,525,We had a reservations at 4:00. Was hoping to have my lobster bisque and did not get it. That was what I was really looking forward to. My husband scalloped potatoes were not ready as well. He also had to get a baked potato. I would expect when the doors open everything would be available and ready.,1
526,526,Love the Oyster Rockefeller! All their food is delicious.,1
527,527,"First time and we'll definitely go back. Great ambiance, food & server.",1
528,528,We always enjoy our visit to the restaurant.  First time we had to wait 15 mins just to get a cocktail. Even though service was a bit off the food and drinks were worth the wait,0
529,529,"As usual great food, drinks and service. Unfortunately they forgot to acknowledge our birthday girl. We were there to celebrate her.",1
530,530,Meal was delicious.  Unable to do table-side service with the exception of Cesar salad due to hiring and pandemic.,1
531,531,"I enjoy Dal Rae for their stellar service and food but today hit different.  We were sat at the tail end of lunch and the waitress was rushing us beyond what I was comfortable with.  I find that fine dining can be compared to hospitality at oneâs home.  From the hostess stand, to the dinner table, I was reminded how they are wrapping up their lunch service.  And this is that I came about 20 minutes early for our reservation, so itâs not because I was late.  The food never disappoints and thatâs what was the saving Grace of the meal.  We still tipped generously as the valet, busboy and other staffers were friendly.  I love Dal Rae and will be returning but this particular visit was disappointing.",1
532,532,Menu was more limited than the past. Food was good.,1
533,533,"First time here and I was really impressed.  Service was good, our server knew the menu and drink menu, plus took our picture.  A nice classy place, I will be back again.",0

536,536,"Two at our table ordered prime rib,  extremely tough.",0
537,537,"Service, as usual, was par excellence.  Condensed holiday menu with top notch items.  Caesar Salad and Sweet & Sour Rock Schrimp were highlights.  Always a treat to dine in this wonderful restaurant.  Our holiday was made special because of it.",0
538,538,Checking in on a reservation was the only bad thing.  Several people in line to check in but lady at the front was answering the phone instead of first clearing everyone already there. besides that all was great.,1
539,539,I was disappointed having made res so many weeks in advance that we were seated in the over flow area.  Only advantage was that it was quieter. We are a 3rd generation going there as our Christmas tradition for many years.  I will be returning next week with girlfriend (also a tradition instead of gift exchange),1
540,540,"dirty martini was perfection!!
food was barely warm, like it had been sitting
rice was crunchy & not cooked - waitress brought us a fresh order right away.
last few times we have been there just was not quite as good as it used to be.",1
541,541,We went for my husbands birthday dinner. Terrific food and atmosphere. Service was off that day. I felt like we were being rushed. Still a great meal. Thinking it was the before Christmas parties or short staffed.,0
542,542,"I ALWAYS love going here but had just a tad bit disappointment this last time. The restaurant was beautifully decorated for Christmas and was quite festive. I had made special reservations for my annual girlfriendsâ dinner for us to celebrate Christmas. Food was great and service good. My disappointment was how closely crowded the tables were, which made it a bit difficult for us to talk to one another as the noise level was then high and conversations not as personal. And, the menu was not as extensive. Example - the small portion of pepper steak had been eliminated along with some other items. I do understand that some food items are difficult to get right now, or maybe this was due to the holiday period. I appreciate that potatoes and vegetables come with your entree, as many steakhouses donât offer that.   But we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and I am looking forward to returning soon.",0
543,543,Service was very slow. Received the wrong bill which showed a Zero balance for what was probably a $400 meal. Server was not very sociable.,1
544,544,"Not a fan of the limited menu on special occasions and was a little disappointed that Ham wasn't on the Thanksgiving menu.  Ambiance is always great there, but they tend to pack them in on the Holidays. Service was great, nothing to complain about there. Looking forward to my next non holiday visit.  :)",0
545,545,"We had Eileen as a server and she was amazing in the beginning, but im almost certain she is unable to handle multiple tables at once. We had to get up and go to the bar to grab our own drinks that we had ordered 20 minutes before 3 separate times, but the people around us, they were getting their drinks relatively fast. The time in between her checkups were about 25-30 minutes in between. If we didnât have the amazing piano bar to keep us occupied, i'm certain we wouldâve grown frustrated and walked out. NOT ONLY THAT, but upon knowing that her service was sub par, some would say bottom of the barrel, we still tipped her 50 dollars. She had the nerve and the AUDACITY to bring the receipt back and tell us that we were supposed to tip 70 dollars or more because of the 15% gratuity. We calculated it out and it was only supposed to be 59, EVEN THEN, she was lucky to even get the 50 after we had to serve ourselves our own drinks and constantly call her over to have someone get the dishes off the table as well as deal with long waits. I found it extremely disrespectful to rub the gratuity in our faces like that. We told a host what happened and they were extremely supportive, I didnât catch their names but they were lovely gals. The men that were helping with the tables and helping with boxing our food were extremely pleasant as well! 5 stars to them. The food was absolutely exquisite. The only taint in our night was our server Eileen.",0
546,546,"Our server, Renee, was warm and helpful. The captain who tossed the Caesar salad, was very informative and made a great salad. The bus boy who bagged up our leftovers was so nice. He had a great sense of humor. Everyone from the hostess to the valet to the service people were just great. Itâs a throwback type of restaurant, but sometimes you want that kind of comfort food. The steaks were perfectly cooked.",0
547,547,"We had a great waitress.  I forgot her name. The pace was very busy but we felt like she was paying attention to our table. 
food was great as always",1
548,548,"Restaurant was a bit overbooked, so a 30 minute wait to be seated was not pleasing. The food remains top quality, but price increases make it a borderline value. The service once seated was excellent, not rushed. The menu is a bit slimmed down from the ""old days"". Hopefully prices will not rise further putting the venue out of reach.",0
549,549,"Lovely restaurant, always busy, service attentive.",1
550,550,we were seated in the rear of the restaurant beyond the restrooms.  ambience was mediocre.  it was during dine out week so we get it.  there is an entirely different dining experience in main dining room v where we were sitting.,1

552,552,Service was great.  Food anazing.  We made reservations for 830.  Didnt get seated until 9.  That was not so great.  They should t over book if they canât accommodate,0
553,553,A nice place for good food.  An alternative to Ruth Chris for special occasions.,1
554,554,"We had a recent party here and were seated in a back banquet room. It was very different than being seated in the main dining room which is dark and cozy. I donât really recommend this place for large parties. Go as a party of 4 and get a booth in the main room. You canât beat that! Banquet room was too light, very loud, multiple parties sitting very close. No ambiance. Food and service were still wonderful. Very iconic.",0
555,555,"We sat outdoors as requested. However, a couple of us weâre bitten by mosquitoes.",1
556,556,This place is old-school rat pack atmosphere.  The food is delish but on the high end.  Check out the menu before heading over so you aren't surprised.  I had the prime rib french dip and a side of steamed asparagus.  The sandwich was great but the veggies were sad and way overpriced for 5 pieces.,0
557,557,"Last weds night our waiter was training someone. He was fantastic and did a very nice table side Caesar. 
Iâve dined at Dal Rae probably 20 times. This is the first time I had to stand awkwardly in an over crowded bar for 10 minutes for our last individual in our party to arrive. We should have Ben seated, ordered apps and a cocktail. Instead had to wait at a loud bar, separate check, etc. 
FIR the first time in 15 years, some of the charm rubbed off the hood old Dal Raeâ¦no warmth whatsoever from the hostess who is a veteranâ¦",1
558,558,"The food was great, service fantastic BUT they donât enforce the dress code. When I go out to celebrate a special occasion, I donât appreciate being seated amongst guests wearing shorts flip flops and baseball caps during dinner at a fine dining restaurant. I was also disappointed that the bananas foster is no longer prepared table side. Time to find a restaurant with a little more class and better ambiance at dinner. I will return for lunch but no more dinners.",0
559,559,"-Ambiance: Lovely, feels high-end.
-Service: Outstanding and attentive, with two minor exceptions: I put down in the reservation that it was our anniversary, but there was no acknowledgement of that at all, except from a gentleman host who was going from table to table asking if it was a special occasion for anyone. I didn't expect a party, but the waiter didn't seem to know it was our anniversary. Also, the waiter tended to take appetizers away before we were quite done, without asking (took our bread basket when there was still one slice left, and later we stopped them when they tried to take the remains of the melted cheese from the stuffed mushrooms). But I would still rate the service as outstanding.
-Appetizers: Good, but we didn't ""love"" them. The stuffed mushrooms were really tasty, but there was too much cheese sauce. And the wedge salad was drowning in oil-and-vinegar dressing -- it was actually dripping from each bite, so you had to lean over your plate to avoid it dripping onto your clothes. And the escargots had so much garlic in them that they just weren't good. The escargot was the only item we just didn't like.
-Entrees: Steaks were cooked to PERFECTION. The filet mignon was so tender you could almost cut it with a fork. It was on the rarer side of medium rare, but that is just fine with me! Only thing: we felt they were under-seasoned. We both added salt to our steaks. The pepper sauce was good, but the meat itself seemed like it had no seasoning on it at all.  But still delicious.
-Dessert - I thought the creme brulee was excellent. The caramelized sugar was on the thick side, just like I like it. 
-Wines - GREAT wine list, and most of them very reasonably priced.

So, the short version: Ambience and service were outstanding. Terrific wine list. Appetizers tended to be over-sauced or over-seasoned; meat was perfectly cooked but under-seasoned. But we both said we would definitely come here again.",0
560,560,"We had a good table on the enclosed patio. But Iâll admit that I had requested the dining room. Our server, Jackie, was fantastic! The four of us greatly enjoyed a meal that consisted of, oysters Rockefeller, chopped salad, French onion soup, Chilean Sea Bass,  prime rib, and pepper steak Filet. Which we paired with a Stagâs Leap Napa Cab. And everything was wonderful! Canât say enough good things about this worderful place!",0
561,561,I have been coming here for many years but I have not have never had to wait standing for 40 minutes for my party to arrive .. wasnât even offer to sit in the are if they bar. I had my mother with me and she  did not have to go through this . So upset,1
562,562,"The food was excellent. Service was also great, very attentive, but they seem to rush you out. We got an appetizer and it was taken before we were even half way done. They take plates and food before you even finish to bring the next plate and get you out. We felt like we had to eat rushed as they kept trying to clean up the plates. The tables are so crowded you can hear everyoneâs conversations. The food is the only reason we would go back.",0

564,564,Just wanted to say that this place is pretty cool not too far from local areas itâs one of the best around. Music was decent food was good service was good. I also like the crowd not like low lives or anything like that pretty much a good crowd.,1

571,571,"I went to Dal Rae for the first time last night for dinner. We were celebrating my husband's birthday.

The food was good and the ambiance inside was nice as well. There was a singer in the bar area singing live music which was nice. Our server was great, but I was a bit disappointed that she didn't sing happy birthday or give my husband a birthday treat (the restaurant told me they would). When I called prior that day, the restaurant confirmed that they were aware that this was for his birthday, and the server even asked us if we were celebrating a special occasion. There were other servers singing happy birthday to their table, but we didn't get get that kind of service with our server unfortunately.

Anyway, we started off with oysters. They were delicious. The starter bread was really good too. They gave a good variety of breads. My husband got the ribeye steak medium rare. He got it with their famous pepper sauce (bacon, onion, 
 peppercorn, mixture pepper) for only $1.75 more. The cook was good on the steak. I got the seabass. It was flavorful and flakey. We got the baked potato and tomatoes for our side. Everything was good. Surprisingly, we really liked the tomatoes. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese but that was disappointing. It was kind of basic and under seasoned. It tasted better once we added more salt. The cheese had a gritty texture which was weird. I would not recommend the mac n cheese. We finished our meal with a chocolate soufflÃ©. It was delicious...totally recommend it.

Overall, we enjoyed our experience at Dal Rae. It's good for the price especially since you get sides with your main entrÃ©e.",1
572,572,Atmosphere & food where great. The service was good however seemed rushed.,1
573,573,food and service is good.  We love lunch at this restaurant,1
574,574,"Dal Rae was just superb.  The escargot was delicious, the drinks were on point and the service was great overall.  My only gripe was the fact that my steak came out medium when I had asked for medium-rare.  I asked the server and he said, ""yes, that is medium-rare."" I've worked in a steak house and this was not medium-rare. The texture and the taste were not there either.  I asked them if they could please prepare a medium-rare steak and he obliged, but it was a little off-putting when he said that this was their medium-rare.  I also asked for two portions of asparagus since I did not want a starch and I was provided with 3 asparagus spears!  If I had two portions of asparagus on my plate, I'd hate to see the single portion which would have been 1.5 spears of asparagus!  Again, he said that this was their double portion. Fast forward, my steak came out shortly and it was fantastic. It was a totally different steak with a fantastic flavor and the texture of the protein was just what I was expecting.  Great job, Kitchen!  I also had about 12 spears of asparagus on my plate when it came out. I believe the manager came out to deliver the plate, so that was excellent in terms of the manager that is present that night being attentive to the patrons and knowing that a good manager visits with their patrons.

587,587,The food was delicious.  We did Dine LA and the value was outstanding.

590,590,"The patio seating wasnât as nice as the main dining area, so that was a bit disappointing.  The servers were attentive and excellent overall.  It took long for the food to be served (45-50 minutes).  The sea bass tasted fishy, which was unexpected.  The filet mignon was excellent!",0
591,591,"Dress code should be enforced.
There were too many people dressed well 'below ""business casual"".
Flip-flops, t-shirts, etc.
The Dal-Rae is a real institution now; insist people dress appropriately.",0
592,592,Chilean sea bass and the pepper filet mignon steak was great! Going back for the sea bass again!,0
593,593,The food was fine; as always.  Our server was attentive; but not intrusive.,1
594,594,"food is great.
reservations allow about 20 minutes or so. not always on time.
still an excellent resturant",0
595,595,"Normally, I give the Dal Rae 5 stars. There were 9 of us, and things got a bit crazy, as people arrived at different times. The server was not on ""top"" of things as usual, and we had to track the server down to get orders taken. One person ordered the steamed clams, and nearly half of them didn't open. The dish had to be remade--sort of surprising for the Dal! I ordered the Petrale Sole, and normally the server asks how it should be prepared. That step was forgotten, and I had forgotten, and wound up with sauteed fish vs. the lemon butter sauce with capers that I normally enjoy. Hence, lots of food, but not my favorite preparation of such a delicate fish. There was no refill on the bread, asked for more butter, no butter. It was just sort of chaotic. On the GREAT side, is Dianne Gire, who is the keyboard artist/singer (we were in the lounge). She is so fabulous. Our friend, Patti, sang with her, a regualar, Gale, joined in at times. We go to the Dal for Dianne first, food/drink, second. We had a total blast--just hope the service improves for semi large groups.",0
596,596,"Hidden gem, love the seafood here but the steak definitely needs an upgrade. Itâs was second time in the ordered steak here and it was not edible. My husband felt bad and wouldnât send it back, but it was not good! We love the salad, Chilean sea bass, and tuna appetizer. The bread is amazing and service is great as well. Tweak the steak and it will be 5 stars!!",0
597,597,We had to change the reservation about 90 minutes before we were supposed to arrive. There were no reservations at the new time we requested but they offered the next available reservation. We arrived before the new reservation time and we were seated immediately upon arrival. The service was excellent. The food was delicious. The drinks were great. I will definitely go back.,0
598,598,"Great atmosphere, friendly, competent staff..",1
599,599,Service once we were seated was excellent. Our server was the best. But we needed to wait for nearly 30 minutes to be seated. And no one offered us a seat. It's understandable to have to wait for a table but it can obviously be handled better.,0
600,600,"Wait time for food was longer than expected, drinks are over priced",0
601,601,"Food, noise level, ambiance all outstanding, as usual.  Service is usually outstanding and did start off that way.  Unfortunately, it did not continue at that level.  We were never asked if we needed more drinks and had to flag our server after were sitting  for awhile, waiting to order our dessert and trying to catch her eye.  This is the first complaint weâve had after many years of perfection.",0
602,602,The angel hair pasta was good. The clam chowder was excellent!,1
603,603,Always a quality meal and service @ DalRae.  Terrific place to meet family and/or friends! Truly a Treat!!,0
604,604,"The food is good.  The restaurant gives a nice calm quiet feel.  It's a bit tight but, it's an old building.",1
605,605,"This is my families special place to go for celebrations of birthdays, anniversaries, etc.  We love the classic dinner club feel and the food never dissapoints.",1
606,606,"My mom, my wife and her grandmother, and my sister and her husband had Xmas eve dinner here.

This is an old school dining restaurant.

We had a great booth and a lovely server.  The food and drinks were great.  We all had a wonderful time and truly enjoyed our evening.",1
607,607,"The jumbo lobster tail was stringy, dry, and had an unpleasant taste. I would recommend not ordering it. The filet mignon medallions were perfect as was the prime rib. Service, as always, was impeccable and our server (Robert) was pleasant and attentive. As busy as the restaurant was, noise level was never a problem.",0
608,608,"Beautiful place to have dinner over the holidays, with a very festive ambiance! The food was outstanding, and they didn't skimp on the portions. However, although the staff was very friendly, the service was a little slow, so make sure you have plenty of time scheduled for your meal and dessert.",0
609,609,"Let me start off by saying I have been to this restaurant an estimated 50 times throughout my adult life. Growing up in Whittier the Dal Rae was always the first choice for special occasions with friends and endless family celebrations. From the way you are first greeted by the well-mannered hostess, too the bartenders who how and what to pour, I guarantee you will start you evening off with polished intentions. The high walled leatherette booths and crisp white linens takes you back to a bygone era of elbows off the table. 
But perhaps the grand dame of steakhouses has fallen a bit behind on itâs kitchen excellence. My meal of appetizer scallops, wedge salad and beef medallions we all good, but not great. The scallops were butter tender but the cheese sauce was a bit congealed, almost velveeta-segue. The iceberg wedge was as expected but itâs plate warm to the touch and the blue cheese dressing a bit runny. The filet medallions were a little over cooked for medium rare, and the smaller than expected baked potato hand a hard callus like skin texture. Donât  think by this Luke-warm description I was unhappy with my meal, I was not. Ive just been more impressed in the past. I just have to come to a realization that times have changed and, the clientele is different. Alas perhaps the combination of Covid and the underdressed Gen-Z clientele, has allowed this once five star establishment to slip a bit. 
All in all I will keep returning, the nostalgia of days gone by will nourish my soul even if the results are not as memorable.",0
610,610,"I miss the table-side Cesar Salad, the salad plate seemed less that usual...",0
611,611,"We ordered Ahi Tuna Tower which is the best we ever had. Chilean sea bass is incredible! The Dal Rae filet Mignon is also cooked perfectly.
We had a great dinner.",0
612,612,Food was great. Service not so much. The waiter got my order wrong twice.,1
613,613,"I have been coming to this restaurant for more than 30 years, this is an old school steakhouse. The food and service have always been outstanding. With that said the food is still outstanding but the service no longer is. The staff definitely needs more training!",0
614,614,The crusted branzino is really delicious. The size of shrimp in shrimp cocktail were huge and very good.,0
615,615,Nice and comfortable atmosphere.,1
616,616,"It was my bosses bday and I noted that in the reservation, but no dessert",0
617,617,There was a party of about 10 people seated near us who were celebrating a birthday.  They were extremely loud all evening.  They made our visit less than enjoyable.,0
618,618,Classic Steakhouse feel and food is very flavorful.  Love the relish dish too.,1
619,619,Nice ambiance. Service was good. We tried the Dine LA dinner menu. The salad and dessert were great. The main entree however was just okay. Theyâre regular menu is way better. Iâll stick to that next time. Weâll be back soon.,0
620,620,"Great food for celebration and soul. When having special deals, servers are in a hurry to get you out.",0
621,621,"Del Ã¡rea is a classic, old school restaurant",1
622,622,"It is  Dine LA week so the restaurant was really crowded and they had a banquet as well. My friend and I havenât seen each other in 18 months so we had a lot to talk about and didnât mind the service. The waitress asked her several times if we were ready to order and we werenât and she was very nice about it because she had her hands full as well. I thought the food was very tasty and I just had a salad. I took my leftover salad home, I had the dressing on the side, and I have eaten it for three meals. The dressing was delicious. Trying not to eat carbs but I did eat one of the crackers but no bread. The restaurant is like stepping back in time to the 60s or 70s. Itâs a great experience.",0
623,623,I put in my reservation that we were celebrating a birthday but it was never acknowledged.,0
624,624,"Food is amazing, traditional steakhouse tucked away in Pico Rivera!",1
625,625,"Both my Wife's and my food was luke warm when served. It must have been a kitchen timing issue because our server was very good. Also, Our Ceasar salad was well over dressed.",0
626,626,Never disappoints! Everyoneâs meal was delicious and the service was great.,1
627,627,"Food great as always, staff a bit overworked as all restaurants are right now because of shortage of workers.  Still a very solid dining experience.",0
628,628,We booked a table for 7 people at 7:30. But we got seated at 8:30. Waiting time is to long.,0
629,629,Always a treat to dine at the Dal.   Truly some of the best meat in town.   Certainly one of the best bone in veal chops around.  Service was wonderful.   Drinks werenât as good as usual but that happens.,1
630,630,"Food was great...  Restaurant was quite busy.   Even with Reservations, we had about a 15 minute wait.  It had a great old school vibe, but music could be a little on the loud side at times.   Overall great experience.",1
631,631,"The food and service was the typical, outstanding! I was a little disappointed at getting nickel and dimes for a corkage/cake serving fee considering the size of our party.",0
632,632,"Dal Rae is the quintessential old timey steakhouse. When was the last time you had a relish tray with carrot sticks, celery, and radishes brought to you when you sat down? The thing to get is steak which is as well prepared as you would expect in such a setting. Portions are large and you will not leave hungry. The place was packed with large and small parties, all having a great time.  There is no pretension here.",0
633,633,"Food flavor was definitely the same but food was not hot as I was used to before. This time my steak came out medium well when I asked for medium, still juicy but over almost like it was over rested due to short staffing. Definitely a wait on all out order but being pandemic understandable. Just can't wait until things are ""normal"" again and can get back to the previous amazing service.

Also parking situation was disaster not enough attendants and having to wait 25 min for your car to be pulled is not ideal.",0
634,634,Very disappointed in the spinach salad it was very salty and not the same as before.,1
635,635,"The staff very is attentive and not overindulging. The bartender knows and makes very good drinks.
Our favorite appetizer is oysters Rockefeller. The Cesar salad can't be beat, a meal in itself.
The lamb I ordered was excellent,  perfectly prepared.",0
636,636,"Nice old school restaurant- great service - food is good a bit on the high side but it's a place you go to for an occasion. Love the service touches you just don't get anymore.
friendly service all around! had a great time.",1
637,637,Celebrating my motherâs 87th bday. Seated in patio area- lots of street noise-also cigar and cigarette smoke coming into eating area from somebody smoking in front of restaurant. A little annoying. Food was good as  always server was excellent!,0
638,638,"Birthday on the patio was good except the large party next to us took over the ambiance 
Waiter was amazing 
She was kind professional and courteous 
The prime rib was the best as always",1
639,639,Waiter was not very attentive to our table and overly hyped up.,1
640,640,Food was exceptional Service was good Waiter was friendly and attentive. This is not the first time that I have been to Dal Rae. It is my go to place for special occasions and family dinners.,1
641,641,"The blonde host greeting us was not very warm. Probably should be reassigned to another position. Expect a high end restaurant to place the right people in right places based on their strengths. Lobster Thermadore tasted amazing but there was no way the amount was as much as advertised in the menu. So it is overpriced for what you get. Other than that, we had an awesome dinner experience. Serving staff were warm, attentive and food was delicious. Grand Marnier Souffle was incredible!",0
642,642,Great food as always! A good place to come to for special occasions.,1
643,643,Good.   Had reservations but still waited 20 additional minutes,1
644,644,Missing some flavor. Pricy meal. Sub par experience.,1
645,645,"This is one of my top restaurants and I took a friend for the first time and wanted him to get a good first impression but he didnât. We got seated and got water right away, but that was it. We waited 15 minutes before anyone came by to bring bread, get our drink order or meal order. After 15 minutes we had to flag someone down and they said they would get someone over right away and still took a few minutes more. I told my friend this is not the norm and normally itâs very quick and excellent service. The service after that was excellent and food was as well. So he ended up liking it. But please donât seat someone if your staff isnât aware or if you are understaffed and not ready for a new table to take care of",0
646,646,Wonderful to be back at Dal Rae!,1
647,647,"Too busy to judgeâ¦Fatherâs Dayâ¦our server was not the bestâ¦
Great history here. Probably give it another chance on a normal night.",1
648,648,"Unfortunately the waitress we had was only OK.  We will return but we will ask for a different waitress next time.
We enjoy their good food in a nice atmosphere and the restaurant.",0
649,649,It was disappointing. We love this restaurant but felt the food was off. Our steaks didnât seem to be of the same quality.,0
650,650,"As usual, food was excellent. However, we missed Heidi tremendously. Our server, Dawn appeared that she had other things on her mind, one of them was Not being attentive to our party of four. Thank you.",1
651,651,The noise was on par with a sports bar. The table next to us was a party of 5-6 customers and they were carrying on with total disregard for others around. We did advise our waitress of the excessive noise.,0
652,652,My wifeâs graduation.,1
653,653,"Everything was great, I just felt the main course took longer than usual.",0
654,654,Very classy for Location being sketchy,1
655,655,Thank you Enrique for creating a special experience during our first visit!,1
656,656,Anniversary,1
657,657,"A good experience, but not the best we've had at Dal Rae.  Service was shaky to start, but got better.  Food was solid.  As things get back to normal, I'm sure they'll get back to their usual high standards.",0
658,658,Food is always on point!  Delicious... and great service.,0
659,659,"The food was excellent as always, as was the service.  This time, we were unexpectedly asked if we'd mind dining in the ""lounge area"", which I agreed to but immediately regretted after we were seated there.  The noise level was very bothersome.  Next time, I'll likely insist to be seated in the regular dining room.",0
660,660,"Great ""old school"" Steakhouse ambience, with a menu that offers some slightly different selections than you might expect.  Food and drinks were above average with a wine menu to match.  We'll certainly be back!",1
661,661,"Jennifer took great care of us - food was very good.
Just didnât like the noisy corner table as they were inconsiderate of all the other partyâs in the room...it was Saturday ugh the and Prom kids were present so a lot going on - but Jennifer was ver accommodating so that helped a lot!!",0
662,662,The food was under seasoned. Took to long to get our car back from the valet parking.,1
663,663,"We came for a Motherâs Day lunch. Our server, Diane, was fantastic as were all the supporting wait staff. The manager came by twice to check on us and was very gracious. It gave the lunch a special touch.  We had an unfortunate incident at the table at the end of the meal and we were never made to feel embarrassed or unwelcome.

We ordered martinis and a margarita which were so strong we each only had one. My cucumber martini was very smooth, chilled, with only a hint of sweetness which was lovely. My husbandâs dirty martini was initially delivered âcleanâ but was followed up by a generous snifter of olive juice that he then added himself.

The food was plentiful and very, very rich. Lots of bread, and tons of butter! Their Cesar dressing has some type of sweetening agent which I thought was odd, and the dressing was a little heavy handed, but the house made croutons were delicious. My sea bass was flaky and flavorful. The sauce and the accompanying scalloped potatoes were again, loaded with butter. Asparagus was cooked al dente. My husband ordered the signature peppered filet which was cooked to perfection medium rare, but surprisingly not very peppery! My mother-in-law had the regular filet which she said was overcooked. The kids had generous servings of chicken fingers that they swore were the best theyâd ever had at a restaurant. Very crispy, including sides of steak fries and a baked potato. The desserts (bowls of ice cream and a slice of chocolate torte drizzled in caramel sauce) were a little uninspiring.

We were seated inside in a large booth by the rear door. The ambiance was dark but with the open doors it was breezy and comfortable. All the waitstaff wore masks plus shields and it felt very safe and sanitized. This is a bit of a drive for us, but I would go back.",0
664,664,"Took my wife out for dinner , it had been awhile and we wanted the best food around .",1
665,665,Great food and friendly efficient staff.  Quality and menus choice have not changed since the pandemic.  The limited seating can be problematic and the seating options limited.,0
666,666,Friends Birthday,1
667,667,Filet mignon  needed a little more flavor In the steak.,0
668,668,You can't go wrong here. Old school charm since 1958!,1
669,669,"Our dining experience here was great. The martinis were just right and the food was delicious. A little bit surprised by no green vegetable side dishes offered on the menu, but asparagus did come with my yummy prime rib. The pepper steak was excellent.",0
670,670,Always great food any issues quickly attended to . old school charm and service great for special occasions.,0
671,671,"We were seated in a small patio area that started out very quaint but then a party of 8 was seated to have a dinner meeting and after several bottles of wine, that group got very loud and the patio became not so quaint. 1 of the other tables in the same patio asked to be moved. Guess we should have done the same.",0
672,672,Don't know why but the food was average. Third time coming here and the steaks were overpriced and did not taste good.,0
673,673,Great dining ambience. It reminded me of a vintage casino fine dining restaurant. Great service and food.,0
674,674,"With no unusual surprises, excellent, as in the past .  Nothing has changed and cannot wait to get back into full swing. Many thanks for the effort over this past year of Covid.",1
675,675,"Our waitress was especially terrific, friendly, and checked on us often.",0
676,676,"I will definitely return.  Food was delicious and service great.
It couldnât have been better.",1
677,677,I heard a lot about this place for years. Dal Rae met expectations even while not fully operational during the pandemic. I highly recommend the prime rib,0
678,678,"This is one of the best restaurants in LA
My rib eye was not as tender as in previous occasions but, it was the 1st or 2nd day for resuming inside dining 

I will be back because I still believe in the Del Rae",0
679,679,Food was tasty and Wine was excellent. Service was efficient and attentive at appropriate intervals,1
680,680,"We had an amazing evening with friends at the Dal Rae. Food was excellent and the service was very good. Still eating outside, a little cool but they have plenty of heaters. We used the menu from The Dine LA menu. Great value.",1
681,681,Excellent sea bass and steak at this long time icon.  We ate outside in a nice patio with the service good but a little slow.  It was a nice Dinela dinner and we enjoyed it. I especially recommend the Gold Brick Sundae for ice cream lovers.,0
682,682,"Food was fabulous as always.  Service was a little slow, not sure if due to restaurant week or just Covid.
Server was very nice and attentive.  Getting food took a long time.",0
683,683,Noticed my NFL face mask was missing from my car.,1
684,684,"Food was amazing.  Service was excellent, although they did get my order partially wrong.  I will be back.  We had a delightful time.  The only thing I will say that was negative was although we were technically outside I personally would've preferred an open air atmosphere instead of a tent.  I felt a little unsafe as there were many patrons and thought the danger of spreading Covid was prevalent.  I understand they want people to be warm and comfortable and the majority prefer that, but I would've gladly sacrificed a little comfort in lieu of safety",0
685,685,"Been coming here for decades. Always consistent. Great food & classy. However I can
see the concessions they have had to make due to Covid19. 
Price creeping up & or portions getting smaller. Guess it can't be helped.
Will welcome being able to eat indoors though. Only a select few restaurants can get away
with semi-outdoors dining.",1
686,686,"Its was ok.. Nice dinner. Feel prices went up. Had an appetizer, 2 drinks, salad for 2. Split a steak dinner with wife. Bill was $160. Plus a tip.",1
687,687,lovely lunch.. we sat outside. due to Covid. very nice!!,1
688,688,"The food was good- first serving of prime meat was over done- but quickly taken back and replaced. 
Fish was grilled to perfection. 
Waiters were not wearing gloves- not sure of that was listed as a precaution on website.
Waitress kept pulling at her mask to speak to us- and then would touch our plates etc. 
when chairs were disinfected- they did not clean underneath the seat side where a person grabs to pull close to table- hence germs left there.
Owner made extra effort to talk with his regulars but didnât acknowledge not everyoneâs table even with a hello- check in. 

This is a restaurant that my family has patronized for over fifty years. We are happy to see that they are still flourishing during such uncertain times when many other restaurants have had to close their doors. 

We will most certainly be back to dine in one of our favorite restaurants!",0
689,689,"Food was wonderful as usual, but since it was outdoor dining, and things were different, the service was a little slow. Donât think it was the fault of our server, I think too many tables in different areas.",1
690,690,"Our server when she collected the plate and fork, she didn't do a very good job on that.   She splashed the blood of the steak on my right arm and skirt.   It was a dry clean only skirt.",0
691,691,Delicious food as always,1
692,692,"Excellent food and service, but patio noise was excessive from folks talking so loud and so much.",0
693,693,"We sat in the outdoor patio--recommended. They are working hard to try and make it ""work"" under COVID! We both ordered petrale sole--normally, excellent, but it was oversalted this time around. The sommelier brought extra wine for me to try--great guy! All in all, a very nice dinner given the circumstances.

One minor problem--the family at the next table had a child who was on her cell phone watching a program, with sound. That was annoying. I would like ALL restaurants to have a policy of no cell phones at the tables.",0
694,694,Everything was excellent except it was an exceptionally hot day and it would have been nice if the fans were a little better in the outdoor seating are.  No other complaints.  Food was amazing as was the service.,0
695,695,"Our meals were delicious especially their signature pepper steak.
Service by all the waitstaff was attentive.",0
696,696,Servers did a great job. They have a nice outdoor seating area.  Appetizers and main course were amazing. The creme Brule was disappointing.,0
697,697,Dal Rae is certainly one of those old school LA steak places. Expensive but worth it when you are celebrating. Gabriel was manager that night and his attention to detail was superb. Looking forward to my leftovers for lunch today. The portions are HUGE!,0
698,698,"Theyâve done a great job for in these COVID times. Food was excellent! Our waiter was great, but it seemed that the food service was quite slow.",0
699,699,Motherâs 90th Birthday.  One of her favorite places to dine.  Dining at Dal Raeâs over 60 years.,1
700,700,Waited 30 minutes to be seated with a reservation,0
701,701,Great Southern California institution! Love their prime rib!!!,1
702,702,"Patio was just too noisy!, police ambulance.  Next time Iâll dine on the other patio away from the street. Hard to even carry a conversation.  But all that being said, excellent service and food as always!",0
703,703,Enjoyed the outdoor patio seating and everything that allowed us to come back to the Dal Rae during this pandemic.  Ceasar salad however was a total disappointment.  It was dry and without flavor.  Rest of the the meal was wonderful as well as the dessert.  I will return but NOT order the salad.,0
704,704,"Happy to have the chance to return to the Dal Rae on a quiet weekday night in June.  They seem to be doing everything right by public health standards, including servers wearing masks, face shields and gloves, and plexiglass partitions between booths.  Still seemed to be trying to get their new protocols in place, and their routine back up to speed.  The menu was not as extensive as before the shut-down.  Upon request, we were able to order one item not listed on the menu (creamed spinach).  Service was excellent as always.  Always a joy to visit.  We definitely plan to return when things are a little more up to speed.  We're confident they will soon be back up to the standard of excellence they have established over 60 years in business.",0
705,705,I had the Sea Bass. It was very good. They cooked it perfectly. My husband had the shrimp scampi and he said that it was too chewy. The service was great! We would definitely go back.,1
706,706,Great food and excellent service! An icon that you should try if you never have.,1
707,707,Food was delicious and service was great.  Always a good experience.,1
708,708,Our sonâs birthday. He had never been there but knew we go about twice a year. He loves great steak restaurants and  he loved this one.  Our meals and service was outstanding and that is why we come back over and over. Can be a little pricey and more than 30 mins from our home but it is worth it!  Friends of our go their a lot and Iâve never heard a negative about their meals or service.  My parents took me to their original location near to the old Hollywood Race Track back in the late 1950âs. Was great then but I didnât totally understand how to tell the difference at 12 years old.,0
709,709,"Old school classic. Expect a trip back in time and you will be very pleased. Also great Clams, salads. Everyone liked their entrees. Didnât order one but cocktails looked great and solid wine list.",1
710,710,"Our food was good, my wife loved her Lamb Chops and my Double cut Pork chop was a little dry. Very pricey, but our server Helga was excellent!",0
711,711,"It was our second straight year dining at the Dal Rae for Valentines. Food was excellent, the staff very friendly and the restaurant had a very nice ambiance. My only complaint was that it took a long time to be initially waited on and a very long time to have our meal served after placing our orders.",0
712,712,Valentineâs,1
713,713,Good is great. We go a few times a year. Servers are hit and miss. Too loud for my taste this time sat close to bar area.,1
714,714,Loved the food ð¥°,1
715,715,"Overall great; reservation was for 7.30 pm and got seated 20 min later; the place was packed. Had to return wine order (smelled strongly of bleach or some chemical) but was replaced.  Food was generous, delicious (lots of butter) and worth coming back to. Nice to experience one of the oldest restaurants in LA!",0
716,716,We had a reservation and still has a 30 minute wait.  Took a while to see a server.,1
717,717,"Everything was good. However, the service was very slow and not very attentive.  One of the servers ran into my chair.  I have eaten there several time and had great service.  I guess this night they were super busy of short staffed.  Also I received a message after dinner stating that my reservation was cancelled.  Which was weird since I was there and checked in.  I called the restaurant and they fixed the issue so I did receive my points.",0
718,718,"LOVED my Sea Bass. Our server made us feel relaxed, made sure we enjoyed our time.",0
719,719,It's my 2nd visit and so far so good.  The food and service were consistent both times.,1
720,720,The food and the service were very good.  Love the atmosphere except the table were a little too close together.,1
721,721,We had a wonderful time,1
722,722,"our server Hailey was great - I would request her again
she added to the evening",0
723,723,"The reservation dinner was on Christmas Eve and it was packed. It was a good idea to get a reservation otherwise your trip to Dal Rae will be wasted since they won't offer you any table at all even though you are willing to wait. We were seated by the patio area where there is no heat and seated next to us a big group which the noise is just unbearable. The food is overall good but compared to the last time we had dinner there, I noticed that the food including the appetizers and ceasar salad was prepared too quick the quality was not great.",0
724,724,Requested a booth in reservation.  Given a table- very disappointed.,0
725,725,Can get a bit crowded and thus high noise levels but it was festive.,1
726,726,"Pleasant, festive atmosphere",1
727,727,"Had reservations for 7:30 P.M. had to wait 45-minutes for a table, which means we werenât seated until 8:15 P.M.  It was evident that the restaurant overbooked as many patrons were placed in the same position...not too many happy faces!",0
728,728,Consistent in their quality and service.  Tables tend to be close together which can hamper conversation and a feeling of intimacy.  Staff is very helpful and generous of their time.  One never feels rushed while you  linger over a quality meal.  The menu choices are extensive and varied.  A place to go for that special occasion.,1
729,729,Was disappointed that they were featuring their holiday menu. But the food and the service were good even though they sat us out in the patio.,1
730,730,The food is always wonderful but the Ceasar salad was not very good.  The lettuce was bitter with too much dressing and too many croutons.  It was $26.00 for 2 servings - way overpriced.  It was a bit noisy.  There were two of us and nearby was a party of 15 or so.,0
731,731,"Server was out of her element, maybe just having a bad day.",1
732,732,"Still our favorite restaurant for special occasions.  The food and service is great, menu selection excellent, and fresh seafood choices excellent. I would give a ""5"" rating on everything except for one thing...it is SO crowded!  I continue to think they try to pack too many guests into a small space. Just walking to and from your table can be a very tight squeeze. Otherwise, a great and classic restaurant.",0
733,733,"The best pepper steaks in town! Delicious!

I was pleasantly surprised with the ambience and the quality of the food. The outside does not do the inside justice. It's a gem of a restaurant.",0
734,734,"Our Server was exceptional, Food, service and ambiance were really Fun they took care my daughter Birthday with a small cake and a candle , very nice of them to do it",0
735,735,Service was ridiculously slow. An hour to get the appetizers? 30 more for salad? 2 hours to get main dish? Delicious steaks but come on.,0
736,736,The table side Cesar was not the same...really not the best. Other than that everything was very good,1
737,737,Everything was great but unfortunately we were seated one hour later than our reservation. The restaurant did not offer to Comp or drinks or anything which was a little disappointing,0
738,738,We always enjoy the food and service a Dal Rae.  We particularly like to enjoy our meal in the Garden Room.,1
739,739,"Nice place. Food was good, service was great. Very expensive for lunch. Not feeling the value.",1
740,740,Solid old school place. Good food and great service. Staff is fun and friendly. Good music. Overall fun times. Will definitely be back,1
741,741,"The food was as good as before, but the service and the bartender were below par. If it wasnât for the delicious food, we would not recommend this restaurant or continue to dine here. Maybe they had an off night and we unfortunately were at their station.",0
742,742,"We seek high end. Our standard is Fleming Rancho Cucamonga.  

Bread was stiff, crackers overly hard, the cold vegetables were good. 

Shrimp cocktail sauce was week and needed horseradish sauce.

Australian lobster tail was fair and better than most.

Rib eye was disappointing. Quality of the meat was not excellent.

Creamed Corn was not as expected and was rejected. 

Cheesecake was great.",1
743,743,"The dinner and service in the dining room was great, as usual. Only comment is that the service in the bar area was slow. Had to wait to order. I will say that once we ordered, the drinks were delivered quickly.. I have been coming to Dal  Rae a couple times a year for the last 15 plus years. We live in Buena Park.  The Summit House is not far from us and the food is good. Big difference is that the Summit House seems so stuffy, not a great atmosphere like at Dal Rae.
Thank You for being there!",0
744,744,"Overpriced for average flavor.  Service was alright not great. Best thing was the gentleman that made the  Caesar Salad, he was a great conversationalist.",0
745,745,"Excellent meal, as always.  Service was terrific, even though the restaurant was very busy on a Thursday night.  Looking forward to going back.",1
746,746,"Great ""old-timey"" restaurant with excellent steaks, etc.  Very friendly professional staff.  Felt like I was back in the 60's.  I then remembered going there in the 80's.  My dad  (90) had been there in the 60's often as had my husband's parents.  Wish there were more places like this!",1
747,747,"I was disappointed in the Oysters Rockefeller and sent them back. They were extremely small, almost as if a whole oyster shell was cut in half and a small teaspoon of spinach and hollandaise sauce was placed in each. The menu said 6 but a 7th was thrown in I'm assuming, to look more presentable on the plate. Not worth the $23.50 for sure and if I were the chef, I'd be embarrassed to serve this plate.",0
748,748,Last night of Restaurant Week and place was jammed and service seemed to be impacted.  Food was still wonderful--service was good but not outstanding as we usually experience.,1
749,749,"Frist time ever was disappointed in food and service. The male waiter was not a good waiter, the liver was thin and not real good.",1
750,750,"Good meal, Excellent service. Although if you go too early, they seem to be short staffed. I shouldn't be consistently filling up my water glass",0
751,751,"I love Dal Rae and visit often. On this visit on a Saturday night, after dining, we went to the lounge to listen to the music. The waitress asked if we wanted a drink. Having had cocktails and wine during dinner, we asked for a water. She looked at us as if we were not welcomed and were clearly a nuisance to her. There were three of us. She brought one glass of water. Clearly she wanted us out of there. Not cool.",0
752,752,"Decor transports you back to 50s-60s Hollywood. Very friendly staff, even though we were newbies. You can tell this place thrives on its regulars. Good food, good service, good value.",0
753,753,Dal Rae is a landmark with a very 60's vibe.  It is worth at least one visit.,1
754,754,"The place had valet parking at $4.50 with no other parking options.  Our party was happy that our table was ready upon our arrival.  We were greeted by a friendly and professional team and perhaps by the Manager.  The food overall was good.  However, the pepper steak provided in the Dine LA menu was not a real steak but it was an overly seasoned ground beef topped with a ton of toppings to add more flavor to the already salty patty.   The service was good too and found that our waitress may be overwhelmed as the restaurant became crowded half-way through our lunch.  In any case, she was very attentive and provided good services.   She was, however, impatient when one of us asked what is included in the pork-chop.  She couldn't explain and stated that it is ""basically a pork chop"".  So it ended there.  But overall she gave her best to serve us.  We dine here every year and feel that the food has not been the same standard.  Perhaps the DINE LA menu is very much different than the one they have on the regular menu.  I hope that they look into providing the same quality of food provided for DINE LA.  My expectation of this restaurant has changed over the years.  I would have given a 5-star had it not been for the quality of the ""steak"" and the service as mentioned above.   We held back answering questions after the ""pork chop"" answer.",0
755,755,service was  not what we usually get at this restaurant.,1
756,756,"Really fun night with coworkers.  We had two servers because one was training the other.  Both were delightful. 

As usual, we all ate too much.  The food was delicious.",0
757,757,"Every was really good, the service ,the food, expensive some but really good, only the wait was longer but it's ok we were happy enjoyed the moment!",1
758,758,Steak had no flavor and was not worth the price. None of the steaks we ordered were the desired cook. Expecting it to be flavorful. Did not like that they didnât give a complimentary salad instead of the horrible 4 pieces of vegetable and expected 10 dollars for a regular salad. The lobster was good but steaks could have been way better. Sat by the entrance to the kitchen and it was extremely loud with the workers stacking all the plates and moving all the cups. Sorry but I would rather spend all that money at Steak n Stein instead.,0
759,759,"Although we had requested Heidi as our server (as stated on Open Table) & reiterated by our 1st guest who arrived first, we were placed at another table out in the patio area & not the main dining room. When we informed that server we requested Heidi, this server was rude & gave us orders to give her the menus & follow her. We eventually were seated with Heidi.",0
760,760,"Excellent service. I had a bone in rib eye steak. It was cooked to perfection. My husband had the Chilean sea bass. The fish was flaky and moist. The sales was excellent. I would definitely go back and recommend the place for a corporate party and for a family gathering. 
The waiting time was a little long even though we had reservations. That will not stop me from going back.",0
761,761,"Waitress seemed to be a little overwhelmed.  Perhaps a short handed night, otherwise fine.  A little too noisy, it  settled down as the crow diminished.  The food and choices are very good.",1
762,762,"We arrived early but met with the hostess who greeted us with no hesitation and showed us to a very nice accommodating booth.  Immediately service greeted us with a basket of warm bread and took an order of libations and appetizer's. Later our waitress took our lunch order which served in a reasonable time.  Food over all for all was very good with continued excellent service.  
I have been to the Del Ray several times and have never been disappointed.  This was occasion was special since it was our wedding day.  We will return.   

Tomas Vasquez",0
763,763,It was way too expensive.  That would keep me from suggesting it to many friends.,1
764,764,"Food was wonderful, service was not as it was in the past.",1
765,765,A rare find in a Traditional French Style Chop House Cuisine. A little too noisy but worth the overall experience in having a great selection of amazing dishes.,1
766,766,"Our server was kind of rude and seemed to be in a hurry, even though it wasn't busy yet. Overall, I love this place",1
767,767,"Staff went out of her way to make sure we were happy, unfortunately my wife has ordered her meat ""extra well done with no pink""  and she had to return it as it was medium rare!  It was her birthday and we had to wait for her order to be redone.  The manager came over for the 2nd time to make sure it was done right which was very nice but the situation put a damper on the evening.  It was very noisy and very crowded with tables very very close together but the my dish of Salmon was among the best I've ever had.   Maybe a time when they are not so busy would rate higher.",0
768,768,"Had my fair share of my date's rib eye and it was very good. The chicken parm was average so I wouldn't bother with that again, but I had to try it since it's my favorite meal on earth. Cosmos at $17 each were a bit too pricey. We're not in Vegas. Lol",1
769,769,"As usual the food was great and the service was a little inattentive; however the busboys was very attentive and helped significantly.
Unfortunately, I believe, the owner/representative was ignorant of the ADD regulatory mandates and wanted my wife to place our Diabetic Alert dog under the table in a carrier.
Totally defeating the training and ability to warn my wife of a change in her blood levels, therefore placing her in significant danger. 
It is this ignorance that harms people with disabilities. Please inform them, if you go, how important it is to know the ADD law that protects individuals with disabilities. ADD supersedes food safety laws.",0
770,770,Food was delicious.  Tables are too close to each other.  Servers and other guests kept bumping into us when we were seating.  Plus it was very noisy.  I was not able to hear the conversation on my own table.   I will definitely ask for a booth next time.,0
771,771,I have been dining here 50 years and  it still ranks very high as a first class dining establishment.  I wish it did not take an hour to get here.,1
772,772,Always good. Chilean Seabass is heaven!!! Thanks,0
773,773,"it had been years since we had been to Dal Rae and we found it to be of the same high quality, with little change to the ambiance.  The only disappointing part was that we were practically sitting on the laps of the people seated at tables next to ours.  At times it was very uncomfortable to be so intimately close with strangers, not to mention the wait staff trying to serve and an occasional ""behind"" front and center!  I do think that for what we were paying, we deserve a little more room as well as NOT to have the occasional ""behind"" in such close proximity.  Next time we will definitely try a booth to see if we are afforded more personal space.  If not I would go as far as to say that it would definitely be a deterrent to return.",0
774,774,"Old dinner house feel...Have gone there for 25 years for special occasions.  Prices have gone way up, e g a $38 pork chop? A $92 steak?! 

Very rich food: Daughter had carbonaraâcould only eat 1/3 of it. I had shrimp scampiâshrimp delicious but drowned in soooo much butter sauce so ate just half.

Great old fashioned service; cant beat that!",0
775,775,"Blonde hostess at entrance desk not to friendly demeanor.

Waitress (I do not remember name) was very friendly.  Ben made Caesar salad table side...very friendly also.",1
776,776,We had a wonderful dinner.,1
777,777,"Dal Rae is consistently good. Service is always top flight & their Pepper steak always a treat.
Only complaint this time is that I suspect that the Chilean Sea Bass was actually Halibut or some other
White Fish. Still good but not what we ordered.  I know that other restaurants do this also.",0
778,778,"WHAT A HIDDEN GEM!  
The Prime Rib dish was delicious!  Perfectly done to my liking!!!  The table we chose was perfect and the service was good.  I will definetly recommend this place. 
One small recommendation: delete the plastic from the bread sticks to give the place a higher degree of elegance.  Other than that, the quality of the food amazed us!  My son, a prep chef, was surprise at ""an egg served with the ahi"" that added something wonderful to his taste palette!  Excellent!  High compliments to the Chef!  
The servers and outside attendants were super nice!  Del Rae is definetly a keeper!!!",0
779,779,Great food and service.  A little too noisy for intimate conversations with a date.,0
780,780,Food quality and flavor remains absolutely delicious.,1
781,781,Their seating is a bit to crowded my date kept getting nudged by the couple next to us.  I do recommend going in the middle of the week. If it is a weekend event go during lunch less crowded.,0
782,782,"As usual wonderful food... concerning it was Valentineâs Day.. super busy ... the staff staying focused kept smiling n moving ... I know it can be crazy n people can be testie.. but my family and enjoyed to night ... 
thank you again n weâll see you soon",1
783,783,Arrived at 6:20 checked in for 7:00 reservation. did not get a table until 7:45. Service was slow food was good but ran out of drinks and waited 20 minutes for the 300+ bill after asking a bus boy twice to find our waitress. To say the least my usual 20% + tip for good service took a hit,0
784,784,"always like the food and surroundings, i eat here every other month. some many other places to fine dine.",1
785,785,"We enjoyed a very nice meal at the Dal Rae. Service and ambience were top notch. Seated promptly at our reserved time. Restaurant was very busy but noise level was moderate and service was attentive.
We enjoyed Veal Picatta,Veal Marsala,Veal Oscar and Sea Bass.
Drinks were generously poured and our Sanford Pinot Noir was very good. We have been here many times and we enjoyed it as usual.",1
786,786,"Everything was excellent with one major exception - we made a reservation via Open Table a week in advance and requested a booth. We received an email confirmation noting the specific request for a booth. Upon our arrival (about ten minutes early), we were led to a table rather than a booth. The hostess informed us that ""requests were not guaranteed"" per the phone. I showed the hostess our email confirmation where it does NOT state that information. To make matters worse, there was an empty booth - and we were told that the people had not arrived and they had a reservation. The booth was empty for about 20 minutes. If requests are NOT honored, it should be clearly stated on the Open Table confirmation.  It was my husband's birthday and our disregarded request did not set a very positive tone for our dinner guests or the evening. Had we been late I can understand why the booth may have been given to another party but that was clearly not the case.",0
787,787,Fun but slightly slow services,1
788,788,"The menu is varied and you can findSomething to eat whether you want a steak, a salad, or a sandwich. They have lots of food that you might remember from the 1960s on the menu. It was my friends birthday and they brought a cak something to eat whether you want a steak, a salad, or a sandwich. They have lots of food that you might remember from the 1960s on the menu. It was my friends birthday and they brought a piece a very good chocolate cake.   It was a very nice touch. This time when I left, the hostess thanked us for coming.",1
789,789,"Dal Rae continues to be an excellent restaurant in an area where there is nothing that comes close to the high quality food and selection that they provide.  Food was excellent.  Only fly in the ointment is they have a new policy and will not seat a party until the entire party has arrived.  They encourage parties to wait in the lounge, but the lounge is set up to serve diners and there is no seating available.  This is tough on seniors who don't stand well for a long time.  In the past if your reservation was close they would seat the parties within 10 minutes of their reservation if the table was ready.  Not a fan of the new policy.  If this is the case they need to carve out some space in the lounge and put some chairs out for seniors that have to wait.  Still we plan to return and enjoy the excellent food.",0
790,790,"We had an intimate corner table with live music playing in the background. Our server was great. She was very attentive and friendly. The food was very good as well. 
Great ambiance as well.",1
791,791,"Service was very slow, steaks were not cooked correctly and no recognition of the birthday in our party.",0
792,792,Great food and wonderful ambiance. I would recommend to anyone looking for that special restaurant with delicious food.,1
793,793,"Always love coming here just today was really crowded. Ordered steak Diana wa recommend by our friends and was told it was made in front of the table but they didnât even cook it in front of us due to it was crowded
I wish before hand that was the case cause it was to salty and saucy for me",0
794,794,"Food was very good and for the price it canât be beat. Place was very crowded and noisy. Definitely not a romantic place or anything like that. Our server kinda forgot to come back to us when we asked for a few minutes to order drinks. But it was very busy. The other staff however picked up on us getting a little frustrated and asked if we needed anything and comped us our first round of drinks. After that everything went smoothly. Escargot was yummy, the bone in rib eye I ordered was amazing and my friend enjoyed her prime rib. We also had the Caesar salad which was prepared for you at your table and that was delicious also.",0
795,795,First time here. We arrived early but were promptly seated. Lydia was a great server. The meat was delicious. The chocolate soufflÃ© was wonderful.,0
796,796,"While the salads and garlic bread were nothing special, the Chilean Sea Bass was truly exceptional!",0
797,797,"If you are coming for a specific dish, be aware that the holiday menu may not include it. Always call during the holiday seasons to know what is on the modified menu. Otherwise excellent food and service!",0
798,798,"The Dal Rae has a throwback menu like you would get from the 1960s. The food is very good and there are a lot of items with sauces that are tasty. The sourdough bread is good and genuinely sourdough. Service was friendly and the bus boy and valet parkers were great. However, The older hostess was Unwelcoming and did not even thank of us as we were walking out of the door even though there was no one else in the area and she was doing nothing.    She did not leave a good impression and must be related to someone in management.",1
799,799,"Dal Rae is always a good option. We were given a table  by the kitchen, but it was Holiday season. Service was ok. I had the chopped salad. It was good but not memorable. The other party had Prime Rib and was very please with it, but was surprised that the asparagus side was three small pieces. It was a business lunch and we were unable to get wifi to work. The waitress shrugged her shoulders.",1
800,800,"The three people who came with me were pleasantly suprised at the food, the service and the total
atmosphere.",1
801,801,We wanted to eat at the bar but the service was very slow. My client wanted to watch the football game but we had poor service from our waitress. Once we went to the main dining area the service was outstanding!!,0
802,802,Thanksgiving so the place was packed. Got put by the kitchen door. Not my ideal spot to eat but lived. Squash soup was watery. Mixed green salad was okay. Prime rib and sea bass were excellent but the sides of a baked potato and scalloped potatoes were cold! Ordered a Manhattan but have no idea what I got. Manhattan's usually have a cherry but this had an olive! Was I served a rye martini? No vegan entree options! I know this is a classic restaurant but not everyone wants meat. Very pricey!,0
803,803,"Went for a special occasion pre set up reservation for son in laws birthday. Server did not acknowledge the birthday nor offer desert as was done to other tables. Our server NEVER came back to see if we were satisfied or needed anything. Had to send a drink back which was made very poorly. The server said oh you wanted it Millennial style we don't do that anymore takes too long. Ordered a chocolate soufflÃ© for desert, sadly it never came. they did offer a sample bananas foster type dish, 1 banana to serve four people? Still waiting for the soufflÃ©. After 45 minute wait the server came to the table and said"" Oh I thought you didn't want it anymore we gave it to the girls over there"" If I had not already left an 18% tip I would have left no tip. We were just sitting there like idiots waiting for something that wasn't coming. Needless to say the restaurant left a bad taste in our mouth. Don't know if I will go back.",0
804,804,"Dal Rae is a great steak house, we had the Prime Rib it was absolutely delicious the meat is very good and it was cooked perfectly!! Very friendly staff great place!",1
805,805,"It wasn't Dal Rae's fault, but I didn't feel well & couldn't enjoy the food or ambiance.  My husband (his birthday) ordered the blackened sole & it came out cajun - screw up with kitchen or server, not sure which.  We have to drive 2 hours to get there but its worth it for the chopped salad & the grand marnier souffle.  Our last visit was for our anniversary, I had steak Diane & the sauce was great, but the filets were small & not that tasty.  We will go again, but it not for several months - its too far (80 miles) & the traffic is awful - not their fault either.  Liz was very cordial & we would ask for her again.",0
806,806,"The night started not what we are expecting. Although we booked in advance, when we arrived we were seated in the patio. The server was rude and even the reception wasnât helpful too when I asked if we could be seated inside (I was point blank told no table available). It was a birthday dinner and we were looking to a wonderful evening but it was almost ruined.  We are about to leave the restaurant, when the owner Lorin, came and intervened. As we explained to him what had happened, he was immediately on top of the situation and made sure that we were accommodated and seated inside. We were given a nice quiet table inside with a wonderful and very attentive server, Mary Jane. From this time on, everything went very well, the food is superb, the service excellent and Lorin is exceptional. Would like to thank Lorin for looking after us. We left the restaurant satisfied and happy and will definitely come back.",0
807,807,"Dal Rae never disappoints, their fresh fish is outstanding.  The chilien sea bass is the best.  Have been going here for years and we always enjoy our time and the food at the Dal Rae.  Service is always very good too.",0
808,808,"Been going to Dal Rae for 40 years, month after month.  I would not return unless the food, pricing, service were not excellent.  It takes me back to my wonderful youthful years where people were truly civilized and not about how loud, garish and ill mannered they could be.  Thank you Dal Rae for the wonderful years of the past and most of all the years that are left to come.",1
809,809,"Food and ambiance was very good.  Server was a lil rough around the edges and proceeded to end our evening by implying that I should've ordered the Sea Bass, which I've had during previous visits and is delicious, instead of the swordfish.  In my opinion, don't tell a customer they could've ordered better that's all.  She wasn't rude in any way whatsoever, came by to check on us often and was extremely familiar with the menu just not as polished as the rest of your staff.",0
810,810,"WAS HAVING A VERY ENJOYABLE EVENING , WAITRESS WAS GREAT, AMBIANCE WAS GREAT, UNTIL MY WIFE HAD REPEADETLY ASKED FOR MEDUIUM PLUS LAMB, IT CAME OUT  RAW, SENT IT BACK AND IT CAME OUT CHARRED/BURNT,THEY TOOK IT BACK AND WE WAITED FOR THEM TO BRING IT BACK OUT. I WAS ALMOST FINISHED WHEN THEY BROUGHT IT BACK OUT.   WIFE  WAS OVER IT, BARELY ATE SO IT RUINED THE VIBE.  THEY APOLOGIZED PROFUSELY  AND THAT WAS IT.  HAD THE LAMB THE NEXT DAY AND IT WAS GREAT.",0

Wait staff was competent and pleasant.

Constructive Feedback - Aisles are narrow! Wait staff and customers constantly just squeezing by each other, sometime slightly bumping tables.

For the first basket of bread, could you consider warm bread?",0

The first one was not very inviting but the second waitress was awesome. She was professional and kept checking up on us. Overall, it was a great experience. We definitely enjoyed the prime rib more than their filet mignon. Their creme brÃ»lÃ©e didnât seem fresh either. That was the main downside since I am dessert type of person.",0

Dal Raeâs wait and bar staff is excellent, especially when they work with or around table side salads and flaming desserts and drinks.  Dal Rae food is classic  American, their steaks and lamb chops were of good quality, well prepared; however, my Petrale sole, sautÃ©ed with capers came in over cooked, small pieces.  If you donât have a real sole filet, donât serve scraps.  I wasted a lovely $80 Pinot noir on a dish that barely merited a light beer.  Oh well, my guests enjoyed their Dal Rae experience. I had a good time, I stopped at In and Out on the way home. Next visit, Iâll have a steak.",0

827,827,Very nice restaurant for a special occasion. Tables are too close together. We had to wait 20 minutes with a six o'clock reservation. Our sainted was very attentive.,0
828,828,It was our anniversary and this is our favorite restaurant to go to for this occasion. We had cocktails with an appetizer before our main course and had a wonderful flaming dessert. We appreciated the hostess and servers wishing us a happy anniversary and both were very courteous and attentive to our needs during the meal. This restaurant is consistent with providing exceptional service and delicious food. We look forward to having more special occasion meals here in the future.,0
829,829,"favorite place for birthdays, business meetings, holiday celebrations with family.
food is outstanding, service is excellent.",1
830,830,Food was amazing. Service was average to good. My biggest complaint is the seating. I get they are making the most of the space but if you are at a middle room table you will be bumped a ton. Also the bar smelled like old people and wet carpet/dog.,1
831,831,Great business diner at this fine long time LA establishment.,1
832,832,Food was delicious!  Service was super slow where we were seated.  Server was not personable.,0
833,833,Valentines Day,1
834,834,"AS PER USUAL, SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT STARTING WITH THE VALET, HOST, AND CONTINUING WITH THE WAITRESS AND BUS STAFF.  MY FRIEND HAD THE STEAK SANDWICH WHICH WAS COOKED TO PERFECTION AND ENOUGH TO TAKE SOME HOME.  I HAVE THE CRAB LOUIE SALAD WHICH WAS HUGH AND EXTREMELY TASTY.  THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAD WAS THAT IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR THE FOOD TO COME OUT OF THE KITCHEN.  PART OF THAT WAS DUE TO THE DATE (DAY BEFORE VALENTINE'S DAY) AND TIME (12:15).  THE RESTAURANT WAS VERY, VERY BUSY.  WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO OUR NEXT VISIT, BUT WILL TIME IT DIFFERENTLY.",0
835,835,An old school steak house!,1
836,836,"Service was great. We had limited time with my client. I ordered my steak medium well and asked for very small amount of pink. It arrived medium rare mostly rare. Maybe next time,,,",0
837,837,Love this place. Waitress wasnât as friendly as ones we have had at prior visits .  The Chilean sea bass is so yummy. Will always return for special events,1
838,838,"This place is great.  Good old fashion feel.  The service is great. The teriyaki tidbits and baked Brie are great appetizers.  Of course, the Prime Rib is tue best I have ever had...",0
839,839,Service was slow for our main course. Steak was great. It just needs to be deliver more quickly.,0
840,840,My husband and I had been to Delray several times before ambience always great service outstanding but food quality was not at its best my husband had the fillet mignon  and I have the Seabass my husband steak was cooked medium well when he asked for medium rare my Seabass was not as flavorful as other times I have ordered it.  It is one hour of our go to date night restaurants so we were a bit disappointed,0
841,841,Dal Rae is always a great place to eat. I am never disappointed with the food. I recommend the Chilean Sea Bass and I order that most of the time. This time felt like having a sandwich and I loved the prime rib dip sandwich. So good! The restaurant was having an event so it was noisy and the service was a bit slower than usual because of the crowd. I suggest making reservations every time you visit.,0
842,842,"My wife and enjoyed the Dal Rae in the past, and after a very busy Christmas week, she wanted a break from cooking. We had a reservation on Friday 12/29 at 6:30PM just prior to the restaurant getting very busy.

We were greeted and taken to our table. At the time the restaurant was about 50% full. The Christmas dÃ©cor was nice. 

The table spacing in the main room was too tight for the type of service that is expected for a ""premium"" restaurant. 

As the restaurant became full, the food service was somewhat hampered by the amount of  isle area to both allow guest and waiters to pass from table to table. This could be solve by removing one table and making the pathway more accessible.

We prompt had our drink order taken, and shortly after were serviced an excellent assortment of bread and a fresh vegetable platter.

Our server was somewhat disorganized as the room filled up, and we found a somewhat diminished level of service to our table. We had to ask for menu's after 5-10 minutes.

The food was very good. My wife had the sea bass, which was very good. My NY pepper steak ( was good, but I liked the prime rib I had previously better. side dishes were fine.

Once dinner was finished, it took us about 10 minutes to receive back our bill for payment once we tended our credit card.

All in all a good experience.",0
843,843,"Wonderfully attentive and professional service in this old school restaurant.  We also appreciated attention from one of the owners who even checked to determine if we could have a souffle since it wasn't on the holiday menu.  It wasn't an option tonite - but, this gives us the motivation to return, which we will.  Quality of the food was very high for all of our choices - beef, seafood & game + really yummy oysters to start & a rich scallop appetizer too.  Festive & cheerful environment for the holidays also.",0
844,844,"This is a wonderful one-of-a-kind restaurant in this area, there aren't many fine dining places in Pico Riviera/Whittier! We love the old school ambiance, relish tray and delicious pepper steak. Always a favorite!",1
845,845,"This is worth the drive from Los Angeles. This is classic old school food, served as well as ever. Everything is good: steaks, salads, sides and especially desserts.  Where else can you get Cherries Jubilee!",0
846,846,"Consistent quality, excellent high end meals. A classic in it's own right. For best ambiance request main dining room, so as not yo get stuck in over flow room. Great holiday decorations, a winter wonderland.",0
847,847,"The food, the servers and the ambiance are awesome.  The elderly lady with the platinum blond wig who runs the host stand must go.  She has zero understanding of customer service.  She is unpleasant and unappreciative.  Plus she is not very organized.  If I bought this restaurant she would be the only thing I would change.  And the change would happen very quickly.",1
848,848,Food is pretty good. Our waitress was amazing! Ambiance was really good. Our only concern was the woman that was the hostess that night. She was not very friendly & came off pretty rude a couple of times. Everyone in our group felt this way.,1
849,849,It took more than 15 minutes until our server greeted our table. She let us felt that she was so busy. After our server took our order we never saw her until entree was served. Food is great and love the ambience.,0
850,850,Great food!  The Chilean sea bass is delightful! Fried Calamari is the best! Steak is cooked to perfection! Weâll definitely come back for more!,1
851,851,"Experience was good, food was average .",1
852,852,"Both the Steak ,Fish and Drinks were above average. The Caesar Salad dressing was more like thousand island, too sweet for Caesar.  All in all a nice quiet afternoon.",0
853,853,Chateaubriand for 2 and caesar salad made tableside make for the perfect romantic and dining experience.  Remember to order the chocolate souflÃ© early!,0
854,854,The prime rib and cesar salad were superb. I normally tell people my favorite place for Prime rib is Lawrys.  Not anymore we absolutely loved the cut and our service.,0
855,855,Dal Rae is a classic steakhouse where service and food are always delivered in an exceptional manner.  One can only imagine the power lunches/dinners served back in the day when the aerospace industry was in its glory days.,1
856,856,"My husband and I went on a Thursday evening for our Anniversary.  The place was packed but we got seated right away.  There was a family with a screaming child in the table next to ours and that took away from the ambiance.  Our waiter was great, the food was delicious, we went because it's close to home and knew the food would be good.  The only downside for us is that it was way too busy and the tables too close together.",0
857,857,"In a world of chain restaurants, this is a perfect change. Pick whatever you want on the menu and it will be great. We have never been disappointed. Service is as amazing as the food.",1
858,858,Service was friendly and personal. A great Sunday repast....post Hamilton show.,0
859,859,"My wife and I went with another couple. We had tickets to see ""Guys and Dolls' in Whittier. We live in San Fernando Va)ley.There was a lot of traffic, I called the Dal Rae to say we were going to be a little late. They acccomodated us and we were seated at a booyh upon arrival. My wife and I had the. Veal picattWoulfa which came with zuxhini. The zuchini was excellent.  We had the caesar sald for 2 made tableside. Giood presentation.  Inside the restaurant is beautifully preserved.
Like when I was there 40 years ago.  I would go back if in the area.  Next time will order their specialty.",0
860,860,"The evening was lovely except for 3 things:  Our waitress was very slow and kind of scatter brained, it was too dark (we had to use a flashlight to read the menu), and my bone-in  rib eye ($52) was very fatty which was made worse because of the darkness.  Why?  I couldn't see to cut around the fat.  And I will add that my vodka tonic was flat.  Other than those things, the 3 hours (!!!) that we spent there was a fun experience eating in a mid-century setting with great music.  All others in the party were thrilled with what they ordered from drinks, appetizers, entrees, and desserts!",0
861,861,"Everything was ... almost perfect! The food was excellent, the service was professional and competent, but we experienced one downside - sitting nearby were three individuals who were drinking heavily and using inappropriate language, including racially insensitive terms. We considered bringing it to the attention of restaurant management - but due to the amount of drinking, we felt the situation could easily escalate and become disturbing and unsatisfactory for all concerned. We tried hard to ignore it, but unfortunately did not quite succeed in this task.
In spite of this, as we mentioned, the food was excellent and the service was exceptional, and we would certainly not hesitate to go again.
It is our hope, however, that incidents like the one we have described would not happen again, and that service personnel would be more cognizant of unsatisfactory  behavior by customers and patrons. I am sure that would be the case.",0
862,862,"Overall everything was delicious and we had a great experience. My only complaint was that the tables are extremely close together, I felt like I was constantly in someone's way even if I was practically up against the table but I think sitting at a booth would not create the same smooshed feeling. Our server was a little slow between taking drink orders/food orders/bringing the bill but it wasn't irritating but for someone who doesn't like to linger I can see how that might be off putting. All in all I would certainly come again but request a booth instead of table.",0
863,863,"Great service!  The food was not as good as I remember from previous years. We like to go here for our anniversary and although it didn't disappoint, just wasn't up to my expectations this time .   Our server was phenomenal, however.",1
864,864,First time there. Loved the food hated the service. Our waitress was cold and had no personality. However i would return simply because of the food was amazing. They need to get younger more outgoing waitresses.,0
865,865,It really was like stepping back in time.  A true classic steakhouse with tableside service.,1
866,866,"Dressing up and dinning at the Del Rae is a great experience, the food, ambiance, service and the restaurant  you cant ask for more.   How ever, sitting next to a guy in a tee-shirt, shorts and flip flops , comon !    A dress code at the Del Rae is sadly lacking.",0
867,867,Overall nice experience. I had a reservation and the hostess found it and sat us near the door. It was a special occasion and I did not ask to be moved but I also did not find her that friendly. There was better seating but my 91 year old mother was OK with the seating. It was her birthday. The food was good but I can't say great. The service was great and that made our experience very lovely. I may go back but it isn't on the top of my list for value.,1
868,868,"The food was incredible, from the appetizers all the way through the main course.  Server was great, but when a larger party arrived the service really slowed down and she couldn't handle her covers timely.  Fortunately we were not in a hurry.  Doesn't change my opinion of the restaurant, and will definitely return.",0
869,869,"The meal, drinks and service were fantastic.  My only complaint is that it was very busy and it seemed like they had crammed in a bunch of extra tables to accommodate rather than turn people away.  It was so tight at our table for 4 that we could barely move our chairs out to go to the restroom or leave at the end.  We would still come back, just maybe not on a weekend night.",0
870,870,Our server Jennifer was very good. Pickle platter and cheese bread are always yummy. Wish the dinner special (surf and turf) portion was a little larger for what you pay.,0
871,871,"The food was amazing, the service was not so good. Our company has had several business luncheons and dinners at Del Rae and the service was always exceptional, but this time it was not. The waitress seemed to always be missing and when we requested something it took over fifteen minutes to get it. It even became a joke for the night we better order what we wanted now or you won't get it for an hour.",0
872,872,The restaurants never disappoints. The wine selection was excellent. The meet was warm but workable.,1
873,873,I highly recommend the Steak Diane which is delicious and they cook it table side. The Halibut ala bin is the best I've ever had and the cheese bread is good as well.,0
874,874,Great service.  Just a bit noisy.   The menu is a bit pricey.  Maybe have more selection of foods.   Overall the food was great.  Loved the atmosphere and ambiance,0
875,875,The piano player was very entertaining. Will return just to listen to him again,1
876,876,"Food, as always, great. But boy has their table service gone down!! Waitress seemed like she didn't want to be there. disappeared for LONG periods of time. Took us 40 mins just to get drinks and put our order in! Then we had to ask another waiter for our check cause she never came back!",0
877,877,"We were seated right away but spent about 25 minutes at our table before ANYONE spoke to us to even order a drink.  Not good. 
We ordered from the Dine LA special but it seemed dried out as if it was prepared earlier and heated up.  Inconsistent quality. 
We usually love this place but it seems to be on the decline.",0
878,878,"Overall very good. Disappointed with Poor Mans Pepper Steak.  Sauce was missing and that made a world of difference.  Otherwise everyone enjoyed their entrees and the service was great.  Bananas Foster could have been prepared better had the preparer not ran out of flame/heat (low on  butane).    Also the apple cobbler was not that good for the price.  No crust or crumbles.  A good piece of old fashioned apple pie would have been better, and without the 15 minute wait.",0
879,879,Great service! We were visiting from VA and made a special reservation to eat at Dal Rae for our son's birthday. My husband grew up in the area and recommended we go to Dal Rae. The steaks were great and cooked perfectly. We enjoyed our dinner and the atmosphere was perfect! Our waitress was very attentive and pleasant.,1
880,880,"They have the best oysters Rockefeller that I've ever had anywhere so far.  I also experience the worst ""sidecar cocktail"" that I've ever had anywhere .  It didn't look like nor taste like anything like a sidecar. Tasted more like a Negroni",0
881,881,"First came here 30 years ago for a business dinner, fell in love with it then. Seems it could use a little updating inside but wonderful service and food.",1
882,882,The chilean sea bass has to be the must have item on the menu......melts in your mouth....quite satisfying.   The menu prices are generally higher than one might expect.,0
883,883,"Dal Rae never fails to impress, service was amazing and much appreciated because it was my fathers birthday dinner. Great food, great service, and a great atmosphere for any occasion.",0
884,884,"Must try the tableside Caesar salad, best ever!! The NY STEAK with the pepper sauce is a really good and juicy. They cook steaks right!",0
885,885,Great ambience. Large menu with a lot of gourmet items. Good service. Atmosphere of a high end restaurant.,1
886,886,Dinning with special friends.,1
887,887,"A lot of table side cooking which is great, but tables so close together it gets too crowded.",0
888,888,"Old school classic steak house with tasty seafood (seabass) options. Mid-century modern vibe with a piano bar. Perfect for dates, business meetings or special occasions.",0
889,889,Always worth the trip when we dine at the Dal Rae. We got there early enough to not feel rushed. Table side service for the Caesar salad is wonderful as well as the bananas flambe.,0
890,890,"The Dal Rae never fails to impress with their great food and  service. 

Keep up the great job

Thanks",1
891,891,"We had a delicious dinner at the Dal Rae. Our food was cooked perfectly, properly seasoned, and presented with care. Our steak and lobster was perfect, and I think I had the best baked potato I've ever had--mostly because of the care our server took in preparing it tableside. 

Some unfortunate early issues made me concerned how wise it was to come here for my birthday. 

We waited over forty minutes for our seven o'clock reservation. When I asked about our table at 7:20, I was told diners were done but not leaving the tables. I understand, but I wondered if any effort was made to gently encourage them to go.

When we were seated at 7:45,  there was some wet food on the seat, and I waited for someone to bring me a napkin so I could wipe it off. Then when I got to my place setting, my fork was clearly caked with dried food. 

I don't like to cause a scene or make a fuss, so things like this make me uncomfortable.

Initially, our server seemed inexperienced. We weren't told about any specials or asked if we had any questions. 

Somehow, I felt like we were at the afterthought table--the one that didn't get much attention. 

Our server was very nice, as was the terrific man who packed my leftovers, but I was expecting impeccable service, and we didn't receive that until late in our meal. 

Also, I wrote a note on our reservation that we were excited for our first visit and we were celebrating my birthday, but no one seemed aware of either. 

The food was really superb, and every employee was so nice. But the restaurant is so crowded and chaotic, I would really need superior service to enjoy another visit.",0
892,892,We hosted guests who had never been to DalRae and they loved the food.,1
893,893,Dal Rae is special. It has been around for ages but still keeps up the quality.   The special touches like a relish tray and Caesar salad made at the table are what makes the experience special.   The service is also great. We would go back for a special occasion or just a romantic date.,0
894,894,We decided on Dal Rae for a belated birthday dinner.  Food was absolutely delicious!  We can't wait to go back,1
895,895,"The Dal is just the right mix of an old school steak house and speakeasy of days gone by! My go to place for a nice lunch/dinner, dressy but casual all in one. There aren't many places left like this one!",0
896,896,First time here. Great selections.Will be back again,1
897,897,"the food was as good as it always is, but the service this night seemed a bit slow. it is never as rushed as if you are at a denneys or anything, but, this time we felt a little bit forgotten.",0
898,898,Anniversary,1
899,899,"This was my 4th visit to Dal Rae's restaurant.  The food has been consistently good.  Our waitress, Sylvia, was attentive and friendly.  It was a fun night out with family and friends for dinner and a show.  I will definitely be back.",0
900,900,Great service and fun atmosphere. A great place to meet friends for Dinner and drinks.,1
901,901,"Classic retro steakhouse. Low lighting, paneled walls and leather seating. Very pleasant staff who take the time to answer your questions and offer recommendations. Food was excellent, had the prime rib and it was made as ordered. All in all a fine dinner well worth  the cost.",0
902,902,"Prime rib is excellent, and the service is fantastic",1
903,903,"The food was very good. The service was a little slow, but I did go during lunch hour and also on Valentines Day. My steak along with my salad was delicious. The only bummer part was that I was really looking forward to desert which I believe they make caramelized bananas. However, by the time I got to desert, the waitress told me that they could no longer offer it because the menus had switched from Lunch to Dinner. On this particular day, it seemed like the switch in menus meant a fixed menu for the dinner crowd. Overall, I recommend this place and will likely return in the future.",0
904,904,Seemed they tried to pack in the people for Valentine's Day. Won't go back for a Birthday during Valentine's Day. Food was excellent but liked the service when it was better staff to table ratio.,1
905,905,"Had a great date here last Saturday night. Cool, old-school, friendly, family type ambience. Food was good, but not spectacular. My filet mignon was very good, but would've been better without the sauce and special Dal Rae preparation way they served it. I would order it plain next time. Very friendly and great service. Loved our waitress Michelle; she was great. Great place for a date: we spent 4 hours there, just eating and talking, and never once felt rushed to leave. In fact, the opposite:  our awesome waitress actually sat down and chatted with us, once it got later and had slowed down a bit.",0
906,906,Good old fashioned place.  Feels like a steak house from the 60s.   Service is excellent.   Entrees for dinner are pricey.,1
907,907,"As always the table-side Cesar salad was delicious, the lobster tail... perfection and the bananas flambe' ...the bomb!",0
908,908,The service was great.  The food was great except for the lamb shank.  The lamb was okay but it did not compare to the filet minion or the fish that our table had.  The filet minion was cooked to perfection.,0
909,909,The food was excellent from beginning to end. Our server was good although it took a while from the time we were seated to the time she came over our table. Had some late evening night caps at the bar. Unfortunately bartender was not the most friendliness. A smile would have done just fine. Overall a good evening.,1
910,910,"Occasion was LA restaurant week and lunch was superb! Signature salad ordered, along with salmon and Professor had something with wine (to whine LOL).Dal Rae is known for its ambiance and swanky retro vibe. Dal Rae awarded Zagat's 50 Best Restaurants in Los Angeles.",0
911,911,"It was our first time attending and we were very impressed. However, the staff, in particular 'Marci or Marcy', was standing very close to our table and speaking very poorly about the customers and management. She was on the clock gossiping to other waitresses about her 'terrible shift.' It definitely toon away from the service. I don't think she realized that I would go out of my way to write a review about this. I didn't make a complaint that night because my girlfriend told me not to, but this opportunity came up. However, overall, it is very romantic and great ambiance. Definitely would recommend the place.",0
912,912,"Had dinner reservations for 8:00 pm, arrived at 7:45, did not get seated till 8:50 pm.",1
913,913,Still waited an hour with a reservation. Hostess who seated us was very rude,0
914,914,"Even with our reservation , we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table",1
915,915,"Usually a great prime rib meal, but a little off this time.  Meat was a little grainy and not as easy to cut as usual.  Mashed potatoes, very creamy, huge  ceasar salads were tasty.  The hot Spinach salad a little too strong of a dressing.  Good garlic bread.  Service is always great and friendly.
Prices were up.",0
916,916,"Though the food was good, I felt the holiday menu did not live up to the one Del Rae normally has.  I was disappointed because I expected a larger menu ; if you are going to change the menu, you need to change the menu on line.",1
917,917,Everything was great . Till we got the bill and was shocked to see that they charged us 155.00 for the lobster my daughter ordered . The waitress should of let us know before hand . All she said was oh yeah prices double during the holidays . What !!!,0
918,918,"I've been coming to the Dal Rae for 15+ years, but usually for business lunches.  On a recent Saturday evening (11/12/16), I was disappointed in the handling of the reservation.  We had a 7:30pm reservation, and arrived at 7:15 and checked in.  We got the ""buzzer"" and headed to the bar, which was jammed, for a drink and to wait.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait.  At 7:45pm, I went to ask how the wait was and when we could expect to be seated and was told - very soon, there are people who are done but aren't leaving.  OK ... I get ""lingering"" but at a high end place with lots of people waiting, hosts should be ready to help gently move people along.  At 8:05 I asked again and now was told that the host was indeed talking to the tables where they had been long done.  We were finally seated at around 8:15 or 8:20.   That frankly didn't get the evening off to a joyous start.  We went from anticipating the meal to being starved, to just being ready to get in and eat and out.

The food itself was Dal Rae standard.  Meats prepared to order.  Tableside Caesar features the old fashioned preparation, including a real egg lightly coddled and added in along with anchovies and so on.  Chilled salad forks and plates make sure greens stay fresh. Prices are high, but you get high-quality beef or seafood.  Dinner for 2 with 1 cocktail, 1 glass of wine, 1 dessert, tableside Caesar, and two entrees was about $180.00.  

I think they should scrap the side of sliced tomatoes if they're not going to serve flavorful heirlooms ... 20-40 years ago people accepted the flavorless icebox beefsteak tomatoes, but today those seem very dated and not at all tasty. Those were a complete miss.

Flourless chocolate cake was good but I didn't find the accompanying coffee ice cream to add much - a good vanilla bean would be a better complement, or else amp up the flavor of the coffee ice cream.

Service was good though busy and rather harried in the early (sort of) part of the dinner.",0
919,919,I've been going to this restaurant all my life and have never had a bad experience. This time things did not go as well,1
920,920,"I always love going back in time and visiting the Dal Rae.  It is really the main decent restaurant in that part of town. In fact it is a displaced restaurant where it sits surrounded by little Mexican food dives and fast food. Their food is top notch, there wait staff is very professional ,  and their prices are fair for what you get. Portions are really large! I'm so happy it is here for a elegant dinner without driving all the way to Pasadena or Los Angeles.",0
921,921,"Yummy across the board, very old school old chop house style , the kind of attention new reasturants cant or won't do. Wait staff was a little stuffy but that the nature of the beast.",1
922,922,"We have dined here for many years.  Our service on Friday was slower than usual.  Don't know if it had to do with the number of people dining, but we have had better service.",1
923,923,Great service and wonderful old-style dining experience. The special Dal Rae anniversary meal was a great value and was quite good. Noted for tradition steakhouse meals that will satisfy any and all meat lovers but on the pricey side.  Friendly staff and ownership made us feel very welcomed. Small parking lot and mandatory valet service for our car was a negative because of the wait and expense. Parking staff was doing its best under the circumstances.,0
924,924,"Our waiter, Derrick, was very friendly and very knowledgable, and accommodating. Food and ambiance, was very good.",1
925,925,"My friends and I frequent Dal Rae regularly  It offers great food and ambiance, and is open late on weekday nights.  Usually the service is excellent, but not so this time.  Unfortunately, I cannot recall the waiter's name, but wish I did because they should get rid of him! He was not attentive, our food took an unusually long time to arrive (although it was excellent when it did), he didn't offer the traditional relish tray without us asking for it, nor bread or refills!!!  This is the very first time that we experienced such poor service.  I'm sure this was a fluke, so I still highly recommend this restaurant.",0
926,926,Excellent food and service;noise level was excessive; seating was very crowded.,1
927,927,The food was excellent. My husband and I go there every year on our wedding anniversary and we have always had great service and the food was outstanding.,0
928,928,When fine dining was an adventure the Dal Rae was a destination.  It still is.,1
929,929,Chilean sea bass was hands down best fish ive ever had. Filet mignon 14 oz medium rare cooked peefectly. Amazing food.,1
930,930,My friend loves Dal Rey so we went there to celebrate her birthday. When I made the Open Table reservation I wrote we were celebrating her birthday but the server didn't acknowledge this.,1
931,931,"Food is very good, but the prices are expensive
We ordered 2 cocktails, 2 entrees of medium cost and 2 salads and with tip paid over $120.
Would only use them again for a special occasion or if on an expense account.
Service is very good but they whisked our cheese bread away before we knew what happened and our friend was disappointed. Be vigilant if you want to keep the bread for eating with your entree!",0
932,932,Great food. Pepper steak is the best.,1
933,933,"The place as alway was right up there , starting with the greeting till the fair well from waiter and hostess......",1
934,934,Definitely a better experience than our first time. Service was much quicker and our server was very accommodating.,1

937,937,I went to Dal Rae for my Birthday because I have heard about it from a friend for a long time. Decided to try it. Food was ok but for the price I could have found a lot better.,1
938,938,Waitress did not provide the service that one would expect for the quality of the restaurant...,1
939,939,"The best for special occasions, and just plain great food.",1
940,940,"The Dal Rae is one of those classic old school places where you can go to experience fine dining at an affordable price for even the most average budgets.  I hadn't been there in over 30 years due to a relocation, but the place was just as cool and stylish as I had remembered it to be.
And the bartenders there know how to pour a drink, old school style!  Excellent place to take that special someone you really want to impress.",1
941,941,"I've checked in on another site at least 12 times lately, and more previously.

The food is outstanding, and the service is usually outstanding. I think this last weekend was an off night celebrating a friend's success in the bar dining area...We had to ask for the relish tray, water, and bread! 

Unusual and a little off putting, considering the $$. But I love the place, and know next time will be better. 

Love the Dal Rae.",0
942,942,The service was terrific and the food was very good. It is great for a special occasion as the food is quite expensive.,1
943,943,Consistently delicious food!,1
944,944,"First time going. Food was good, but steak could/should have been a bit more tender for the price.  Great place for special occasions, ie:  birthdays, graduations, etc. Glad to have a cut above steak house on this side of town and not have to travel to west side or downtown.  Lot's to try, will go again.",0
945,945,Mary Ann and Bobby was very pleasant and made suggestions that we enjoyed..,1
946,946,"Well, I enjoyed Dal Rae again, however, I have been experience the same problem the hostess
the way she welcome people, is rude, careless and unkind, ""Hi"" of course I made sure that she can see my disappointment  telling her ""what wrong with Good Evening"" this is a complain that  I report before, nothing has been  change, but is the first and last impression you have, it is a shame that after I report, talk to the owner, nothing has been done.

This attitude would not stop me to visit Dal Rae, however, in some instances I will visit other restaurants for this attitude, is annoying that after you talk to the owner, send an email, this continue, my wife birthday is July 10, 2016 however, Richard Barrantes that he is a frequent customers in there, asked my wife her preference, she decided to visit another restaurant in Pasadena, you food is great, you service is great, the owner and Sommelier  are great, but the hostesses' welcome is not acceptable.

I am sure that the owner remember me, I was in the first table with two beautiful woman, he said hello in this date (Wednesday) 

Chef Ramirez",0
947,947,"Don't go on a holiday. They drastically minimize the menu and table side food prep, which is the main part of the old school charm. Go any other time. Order pepper steak, table side ceasar salad and cherries jubilee. Martinis and a fine red to wash it down. Delicious.",0
948,948,"Dal Rae has the feeling of a mature restaurant.  I've heard of it from locals for years.  We gave it a try for our friend's 60th birthday.  From the entrance we were greeted in a friendly and welcoming manner.  We had a reservation, were able to be seated quickly.  The noise level was quite good for us.  The dining room was not noiseless, but we were able to have a relaxing conversation at our table.  Service was timely, friendly, and not pushy.  We had time to ask questions about menu items and to think about what to order.  The menu looks kind of old school, but our choices were well prepared and delicious.  They prepared the duck with an orange sauce at table side and my friend enjoyed it.  We also saw other tables having other items being prepared table side like Caesar salad and something that looked like Bananas Foster, and they all looked well done.  
Prices are not cheap, but with the quality of the food and service, along with the somewhat formal ambiance, I'm going to go again and try other items on their menu.
Good experience for us.",0
949,949,"We have been here twice now. I do enjoy the kind of throw-back atmosphere, and menu.
Our server was great and charming as well. The Shrimp Scampi appetizer was excellent, almost like mini lobster tails. The Pepper Filet was good, and the baked potato was REALLY baked. I don't quite understand the relish tray. I know it is also old school, but the items aren't really that good, or cold. I also found the Hostess rather short, and disinterested when I arrived earlier then my friend. All in all we will come again, just for the old school appeal.",1
950,950,"FOOD WAS GREAT, SERVICE WAS EVEN BETTER, OVERALL IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE.",1
951,951,Saw this place many times.  Decided to try it.  Parking was a little slow but our table was ready and every one friendly.  Little noisy.  Was going to have a drink in the bar after dinner but it was to noisy.  Steak was very good.  Chicken breast average.,0
952,952,"This is a great area steakhouse that my wife and I tried for a date recently.  Really enjoyed the food and the friendly service.  I had the bone-in Filet Mignon and my wife had the Alaskan king crab legs.  Both were great.

Server was both friendly and attentive.  We particularly liked the table side salad preparation and noted that several patrons were there celebrating birthdays.

This is one of the better restaurants in the area for a special occasion or a nice night out.  Not too many other higher end steakhouses in the area.",0
953,953,Food is very tasty and the ambience is very nice too.,1
954,954,"Two of us had a nice evening. There are comfortable booths to sit in, and the staff are very attentive and helpful. The creme brÃ»lÃ©e was very nice.",1
955,955,"Over all it was a great evening. Food, service, and establishment were very good and they work as a team to provide outstanding service and food.",1
956,956,This is a great place my wife and I try come once a month.  The service and food are always great.,1
957,957,Food was delicious but overly priced. Drinks are not good. Too strong. Room was overcrowded. Didn't have enough walking room.,0
958,958,"THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESTAURANTS--SO I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED AT THE DINING ROOM SERVICE AND I WOULD SKIP THE LOBSTER SANDWICH SINCE IT HAD VERY LITTLE LOBSTER AND WHAT IT DID HAVE WAS OVERPOWERED BY THE OTHER INGREDIENTS.  WHILE THERE WERE 3 WAITRESS, OUR WAITRESS SEEMED TO BE THE ONLY ONE WORKING AND WAS COVERING MOST OF THE DINING ROOM.   SHE REALLY WORKED HARD.  THE BUS BOYS  WERE EXCELLENT AS ALWAYS.   MY FRIEND'S BATTERY DIED IN THE PARKING LOT AND THE VALETS JUMP STARTED IT FOR US WHICH WAS FANTASTIC.  WE WILL BE BACK BECAUSE THIS IS HOPEFULLY A ONE TIME EXPERIENCE.",0
959,959,love the food and the service here.  only thing I do not care for is how cramped it is when they are busy.,0
960,960,Chilean Sea Bass is outstanding!  DineLA prixe fix meal is a good deal.,0
961,961,"If you want an old school steak house with good food, this is the place to go.",1
962,962,The sea bass was exceptional. The fixed price menu was a great value.,0
963,963,It lives up to the expectations of an old school steak joint with quality food.  Veal chop especially good.,0
964,964,"We love going to Dal Rae for special occasions, and were really looking forward to the Chilean sea bass.  It was very good, but not quite up to the usual standard we have come to expect.  We went on a Tuesday and did not recognize any of the wait staff, so are unsure as to whether there has been a large turnover in staff or that this was a day off for the regular staff (many have been there for years).  So perhaps the chef was a backup and not the regular chef.  Again the sea bass was very good, but it wasn't exceptional.

We will definitely return again, not on a Tuesday, to see if we just caught them on a slightly off night.",1
965,965,Not many Italian entrees but still enjoyed the restaurant.,1
966,966,"My husband ordered medium and it was overcooked, mine was as well. The pepper steak is good but too peppery for my taste.",0
967,967,Food was outstanding.  Peppered steak and lobster. Awesome,0
968,968,"Once again the Dal Rae did not disappoint. My wife and I had a wonderful dinner for our special day. Appetizer, soup, entree, and dessert were splendid. You can't go wrong here for a special occasion. Noise level a little high because the tables are so close together. You can hear every word of the conversation at the next table. However, I heartily recommend the Dal Rae.",0
969,969,Service was good and the Rib eye bone steak was excellent ! I will return again.,0
970,970,"Very nice restaurant to spend very quiet time indulging delicious food, have gone there many times, will go there anytime, best place to take your significant other.",1
971,971,"Small feel, cozy. Only quality restaurant for miles. We travel from north OC to eat here. You can count on the quality of the food. 
If Dal Rae's packed, you can bet the noise level's high and wait time for food can be trying. If you enjoy cocktails, you won't have difficulty passing time. And no short pours.
You can count on each course being exceptional. 
Seldom do we finish a meal. Take home is normal.
Always count on the Chocolate Souffle!!!",0
972,972,Dal Rae was all & more as recommended by clients & l'll be back,1
973,973,"They never disappoint.  We order the bananas flambe and the owner came over to do the table side presentation and it was over the top.  The time before, I brought my mom for her anniversary which was a very emotional time because it was the first year since the passing of my father and the waitress was very sympathetic.  She did an amazing job.  We have had great services and amazing food every time.",0
974,974,"never fails to excite and satisfy, took friends and a great time was had for all.",1
975,975,"I love classic restaurants such as Dal Rae, so I was very much looking forward to visiting (and especially excited to try the Caesar salad). We are from Philadelphia. The food was outstanding and our server was excellent. 

The only problem was: When we arrived, our table wasn't ready... For that reason, we were ushered to the bar and encouraged to order a drink while waiting. When our table became available (5 minutes later), the hostess guided us --along with our drinks--to the table. Five minutes later, the woman who had taken our drink order brought us a separate check from the bar. We assured her that we would pay it (though it would have been easier if it had been transferred to the table), but because we were distracted by preparation of tableside caesar salad, we didn't pay immediately. Our server noticed that we were distracted, so she transferred it to the table. We appreciated that. Well, it was obvious that the woman who had taken our drink order was upset. She approached our server in the middle of the dining room with a look of frustration on her face and literally pointed at us. I totally understand what was going on as I've worked in restaurants my entire life; but in my opinion, it was not right to put that on display in the main dining room.",0
976,976,Dal Rae is a hidden gem of a restaurant. This restaurant is classic and timeless. We celebrate our special occasions at Dal Rae. The service is great! The table side Ceasar is a must! The entrees are phenomenal!,0
977,977,"Great restaurante and nice server; however, she got the order incorrect several times.",1
978,978,"On a very busy Saturday night, we received cheery service, treated as if we were the only people in the restaurant.  Terrific menu + lots of off-menu specials.  The dinners were delicious, and plates were attractively arranged.",0
979,979,"You won't be disappointed 

Great food
Reasonable prices
Ambiance was if bygone days 

I endorse!",1
980,980,"This was the second time that I have dined here and it was just as over the top as the first time.  The service was amazing along with the food.  The only thing, I wish is that it could be a little more intimate.  It was little to crowded which made it a little to busy/noisy.  The staff did any amazing job even though they were very busy with each table.",0
981,981,It was my friends 75th Birthday and I noted that in my reservation on Open Table.  It was not acknowledged at the restaurant.  My friend wouldn't let me bring it up.  They were very busy and I guess the hostess didn't notice it and bring it to our servers attention.,1
982,982,"We were looking forward to going  dal Rae because they have one of the best old fashion Caesar salads made table side. We convinced the family to go on Friday night but little did we know that on holidays it is a special menu. Since it was Mother's Day weekend, the Caesar salad was a pre mixed bottle dressing that was not good. We did not know there is holiday menu on special days so check before you go..

The wait staff was fabulous and  the food in general was good. We wish we could have had the other menu and options.",0
983,983,The food was great but I think that our server had too many tables to manage.,1
984,984,"I took my Mom here for her birthday and as usual, the Dal Rae did not disappoint.  She had the poached salmon with hollandaise  sauce - declicious.  I had the filet mignon pepper steak and it was cooked just the way I like it - medium rare.  We had the baked scallops cava de oro to start which we have been getting for 20 years.  The only thing was the scallops this time were not  the large tender ones we were used to getting.  Ours were small and a bit tough.  That is the only thing that was off.  Service was great and Kevin came by to say ""Hi"" which is always nice.",0
985,985,"We met friends here for dinner on Saturday night and the place was hopping--every table was full. We had a 6:30 reservation and they seated us a few minutes early. The food was excellent and the wait staff was very friendly and on top of things. However, there were, as I said, 4 adults and we were squeezed into a booth that would comfortably only hold 3 adults normally. That is my only complaint. We have been there many times for lunch and have always enjoyed the wide array of choices and the dinner menu was equally varied. I had a spinach salad and pasta, which was very good. My friend had Chilean Sea Bass, which she said was delicious. And the 2 men had the filet pepper steak, which is the specialty, and both enjoyed it thoroughly...",0
986,986,"Service is great and food is good. Overall, a fine place to dine and you can't beat it's old school charm.",1
987,987,"Hostess was not very friendly this time- maybe just having a bad day. Server (Dawn) was wonderful, food was very good.",0
988,988,Our experience  at Dal Rae was nice and the food was delicious. I would recommended this restaurant to anyone who wants a more formal evening out; you don't feel you have to completely dress up for the meal.,1
989,989,"One of the biggest problems I've had with Dal Rae over the years is the music.  On Valentine's Day, it was the worst.  There was a musical act that was performing 80's jams for an older crowd, and the noise could be heard all over the dining room.  A bunch of rowdy, drunken people getting excited about Cameo's ""Word Up"" is not my idea of a romantic dinner.  I wish Lorin Smith would do a better job of finding musical acts that fit the Dal Rae ambience.  If there could be a way to have performers like Marty and Elayne (from the Dresden), Dal Rae would be the best.",0
990,990,Had a fabulous lunch ir was so easy making the reservation online.,1
991,991,We go here all the time for business events but I love to also come for dinner. Service an food is great!,1
992,992,"As alway there fod was over the top . Steaks and and that go with it were just cooked to what ever was ask for. Year ater year they keep doing it the right way . This year the service came up a little short to what we have come to enjoy in the past. She was a great lady , worked pretty hard but just came up short.Once we told her we were not goig with wine and drinks from the bar she pretty much change. We were never ask after that if there would be any other drinks. No tea,soda,etc. Afterthe desert was over then she ask if we would like coffee. We  ask for cheese bread and she said it would take a few extra mins. It never came. So over all it was ok .Just not what we normally have. Last year was so so good on all areas that maybe we are spoiled .",0

Dress code was not in place so many people in tennis shoes jeans and t-shirts we noticed while sitting next to valet stand outside.  .We actually thought of leaving  but couldn't get reservations at a comparable restaurant . Your MaÃ®tre Di  was gracious and comp our party a shrimp popper appetizer, Nice .  We really were not happy with the wait shuffle  ,Walk ins Were mixed in with people with the reservations our party was a total of 4.",0
995,995,"I got the noted dish and my husband got the prime rib.  My dish was great, but my husbands prime rib was like butter, sooo good.  Definitely recommend.  Real busy place, we had early reservations which worked good.  We did not valet, but parked in the closed business next door. No wine list on the web, but they do have a good list. (we ended up bringing our own, not knowing the list)",0
996,996,Food was amazing. Service like no other. Table side a must. Steak the best.,1
997,997,Food is always amazing. Try new things every time and doesn't disappoint.,1
998,998,"i was annoyed that we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated having shown up on time for our reservation. Following that hiccup the rest of our extinct was delightful.  The traditional Caesar salad was great. Pasta an veal dishes were well prepared. The most notable aspect of the evening was outstanding service. Our waiter, John, was personable competent knowledgeable and flexible. It made the evening special",0
999,999,"I looked forward to going here for a long time and the food was great. We missed enjoying the table side preparation of many of our dishes since they sat 8 large people at a 4 top table next to us and there was no room. Also our waiter seemed too rushed.  Just a little too crowded in the dining room for the cost of a meal, we dropped $400 for the 4 of us.",0
1000,1000,Very very expensive but very romantic. Parking should be valet optional or free. Loved the steak but my appetizer the sashimi was very grissley. The first round of drinks we were over charged but we didn't say anything. Great waitress...loved her.,0
1001,1001,"The bar is lively and bartenders are some of my favorite martini makers! The food was great as it always is. Love the sea bass and my hubby loves the pepper steak. The hostess was awesome as our friends were late and she accommodated  us by moving our reservation back on a very busy night. But this was the first time our table service was a little slow, server liked to chat with the other servers more then take our order.",0
1002,1002,"Food and service were excellent, as usual. Changes to the menu for obvious reasons, busy for the holidays. My only complaint is that someone should have had the cahonies to tell the party sat next to us that dogs are not appropriate (lest service dogs) at the table. Don't get me wrong, I like dogs just like the next, I'm not an animal hater. However, not the time nor place to have the dog out of its carrier and at the table -",0
1003,1003,Forgot that the Menu was limited and prices were higher due to the holiday. We were there celebrating a birthday. Enjoyed music after dinner!,1
1004,1004,Had a good time with my friends and the flowers I ordered were more then I expected. The server met our every needs. A very nice evening was had by all.,1
1005,1005,"I have been attending this restaurant since 1987 the service is great, we have no complains what so ever, we made a lot of recommendations to visit this place",0
1006,1006,"Came here with GF for Thanksgiving and had the turkey dinner.  Salad, main course and cheesy bread were tasty.  Desert was ok, service was ok.",0
1007,1007,Thank you John so much for always being so wonderful to us.  We keep coming back because of you.  You are the best.,1
1008,1008,"We dine at the Dal Rae often always very good to excellent., however this was the 1st time ordering the Wilted Spinach Salad as a first course and I did not like it......the entrees were very good as usual.",0
1009,1009,"Overall, it was a very good experience, with a couple of minor gotchas.
First, I indicated on my OpenTable reservation that we were celebrating my wife's birthday. Nothing special was done and no mention made, but not a big deal.
Second, the restaurant was crowded (it was a Saturday night, after all). This meant that the table side Caesar salad had to be made in a little alcove, not table side. Oh well.
Speaking of which, that salad was just okay. Not sure what the deal was, but it's usually very good. Not this time.
The bread basket was just okay, nothing special. Cheese toast was very good.
We ordered the world famous pepper steak, the filet mignon for my wife, the New York cut for me. Both were excellent, cooked just right, tender and juicy. Sides were garlic mashed potatoes (very good), and a baked potato (pretty good, standard).
Dessert was the chocolate souffle. That was delicious! It was so hard to put down the spoon, even after the souffle was all gone...
Dal Rae seems to have added more tables since the last time I was there. The wait staff was constantly walking past our booth and I was always afraid I was going to trip someone with my long legs whenever I stretched them out. The manager came by a couple of times to check up on us, and our server, Gabriella, was excellent. Not intrusive, but seemed to be around when needed and also checked in on us regularly. Great service!",0
1010,1010,"10oz Prime Rib was way too fatty, disappointing for the price i paid, but your Chilean Seabass ala ben was even bettet than the Summit House in Fullerton!",0
1011,1011,"Met family at this restuarant, hearing about Dal Rae for years.  We enjoyed ourselves and really liked the whole 1950's vibe of the place, but the highly recommended Pepper Steak (which 3 of 4 people had) was so over-powering in spices that it just wasn't enjoyable.....order something else to make the night special.  And, I had put on the open table reservation ""2 birthday's"" and no one remembered this....and I could not let the waitress know so the surprise was amiss.",0
1012,1012,The food at Dal Rae is very good.  I love their sourdough bread and the jalapeÃ±os pita chips that are given when you arrive.,1
1013,1013,The food and the service are always very good.  You have to try the bananas flame for dessert they're fabulous.,1
1014,1014,"We have been to the Dal Rae on many occasions, and this time I have to say I was disappointed, not in the food (always excellent!) but in the continued crustiness of the hostess.  We arrived on time for our 7:30 reservation, yet were handed a beeper without a word from her.  She was so busy watching her computer screen that she didn't make eye contact, greet us, or comment on our wait time.  I inquired about the wait and she said it would be about 15 minutes.  That rolled into 40 minutes before we were seated.",0
1015,1015,"With very good food, excellent service and a great ambiance, this place takes care of you each time you visit them.",1
1016,1016,great food and service as usual!!!  Drinks were also excellent!,1
1017,1017,Dal Rae is one of those old school restaurants that is unchanging. Right there with Musso & Frank and Pacific Dining Car.,1
1018,1018,"Favorites were brie appetizer and sea bass entree.  Not on the menu, but ggod to know that you can ""surf and turf"" combo any beef item with the sea bass...well worth the ask.  Babanas foster made tabelside was a hit for groupentertainbment and serving it over icecream was tasty and a break from traditional versions that I've had before.  Ambiance was nice--a little dark (blinding when you come in from CA sunshine)=-- but definitely worthy of business or special occasion dinners.  Only downsides:  table was small for a party of 4...we squeezed into a slightly smaller space than desired to get a seat quickly. Also,  table service was slow...especially drinks being brought to table from the bar.",0
1019,1019,"Delicious food, nice ambiance and service was great. Staff is very friendly.",1
1020,1020,"When you sit a couple at the large booth in the middle of the restaurant, as you did with my wife and I, you should let them know there is the possibility that you might be putting another group there instead of just surprising them with two strangers suddenly being sat with you. It can make for an awkward and almost evening ruining situation. I realize you're busy but a surprise like that is borderline unforgivable, particularly because it's a booth. Otherwise everything was just fantastic.",0
1021,1021,"The food was fantastic. Steak Diane was best we ever tasted. My daughters kids prime rib was amazing as big cute, cooked rare as she likes, and 1/4 price of Adults with sides and dessert. Great value for kids meal.",0
1022,1022,"The food was great, setting was romantic except the drunk woman next to us who was extremely loud and obnoxious.. We made a 10pm dinner reservation and didn't realize the kitchen closed for orders at 11pm.  That is something the server should have told us prior to 11pm, not after when we wanted dessert.  I had my heart set on the Creme Brulee.  After my obvious disappointment, she had her manager make me one from scratch so that was very nice.  Food is always excellent!   We also were not given/offered the cheese bread, which is a fav, because they ran out?  Strange, but maybe 10pm is too late to get full service.",0
1023,1023,"This is an old standard restaurant emulating a time gone by like a Frank Sinatra song.  Always good food, always interesting people watching.  Great chef and they will deviate from the menu to give you what you desire for your entree.",0
1024,1024,"The Dal Rae was wonderful. It was very crowded and busy on a Sunday night with lots of groups celebrating birthdays etc. I took a small group for a busy dinner. My guest raved about the food with every bite. We had their famous ""Pepper Steak"" which is made from a great cut of Filet . The meat was perfectly cook and the ""pepper"" seasoning was awesome. We finished the meal with a Chocolate and Grand Manier Soufflee which was to die for, but the hands down favorrite dessert was the Banana's Foster. It was made tableside and was both dramatic and wonderful. I look forward to my next visit. I recommend reservations as it seems to get VERY busy.",0
1025,1025,Never a disappointment. Excellent food and service.,1
1026,1026,Never lets me down on service and the food is very good always.,1
1027,1027,"Food is great, service is Great, portions are generous. a bit pricey but you are getting quality. A bit cramped but it makes it feel cozy.  Make sure you are hungry and save room for the souffle!",0
1028,1028,"There are great selections for all entrees, with prices to fit any budget. While it can get expensive for some entrees, you can also find very reasonable entrees and can still enjoy the ambiance.",0
1029,1029,"Dining at this restaurant reminded me of night clubs in the 50's: full of smooth understated elegance, with teams of people attending to your every need. The food was excellent, by the way!",1
1030,1030,"It was my wife's birthday so we went to Dal Rey Pico Rivera for Dinner. My wife grew up in Pico Rivera sine 1955 and had never been to Dal Rey. I invited her sister to go with us as she had never been to Dal Rey either. We all had a very nice time and our server was excellent. The food was very satisfying, as well as desert and our drinks.",0
1031,1031,Service was good. Food was delicious.,1
1032,1032,"The restaurant is beautiful, the food wonderful and of generous proportions, but as could be expected for a busy spot, on the noisy side making conversation somewhat difficult.",0
1033,1033,"Great offerings for a Valentine's menu. The Caesar salad was super, disappointing that it was not tossed table-side. We were seated in the banquet room were only small round tables for two were arrenged. The ambiance was not romantic at all, some guests were dressed too caual for the occasion (baggy jeans with wrinkled t-shirt). The dining room was packed as was the small bar area, no room for dancing. The Chilean sea bass was very good crusted with parmegiano and served with asparagus and caramelized onions. Also Peppered Filet of Beef at 14 oz. was cooked to perfection. Dessert was another favorite, chocolate covered strawbwrries infused with Grandmarnier and covered with whipped cream...to die for. The service was very attentive.",0
1034,1034,"My girlfriend and I loved the food. She can't have certain foods and they were willing to alter the way they prepared the food to meet her needs. The only thing I had a problem with was the service. They kept us waiting over 10 min after they sat us before our server stopped by to ask if we wanted something to eat. Once she did it took another 15 after we got our drinks (and that was 10 min after we ordered them) before our server came back to take our food order. It seemed as though regulars got more attentive service, which, how would you become a regular if your not treated well when you go there.",0
1035,1035,"We have returned to this gem in Pico Rivera and we were not disappointed. Lots of old world charm and still the best prime rib I have ever had. Love the salad prepared table-side and the soufflÃ© for dessert was magnificent.
We had such a great time, even though it was quite busy, we did not feel rushed. Valet parking was so efficient and reasonable.",0
1036,1036,"I think when there are big parties you should make sure you have enough servers for the rest of therestrant
Because we had to wait for our drinks an food an the server kept saying sorry we have two big parties.",1
1037,1037,"Good good, good service. Not many of this style of steakhouse around LA anymore.",1
1038,1038,Came here for our Anniversary and enjoyed a wonderful evening in this great place.  All was cooked to perfection and ambience was great.,1
1039,1039,"Went here years (up-teen) ago for my 33rd birthday. And once again celebrated a birthday. Our initial experience was starting to wane on us as we had made reservations weeks in advance and still had to wait over 30 minutes to be seated. Happily, once seated our experience was great. Our server was very knowledgeable and correctly steered my son from the burger he was thinking about (kid behind us had one ... all bun.) and offered some other great suggestions. The steaks were done perfectly to our order as the seabass was very flaky and moist. If you haven't been there and don't know it's 55 year history ... You may be surprised at the relish tray with large chucks of pickles, carrots and green onions - A throwback to the 50's.",0
1040,1040,"As always, great for dinner.",1
1041,1041,"Class all the way however for the price I think
The food could have been better , it was New Years wave
So I think they probably capitalized on that. I will definately go
Back when they have a full menu. My parents came here all
The time when I was little so now it was my turn! Good to know
That this place can still be going strong after 60 years",0
1042,1042,Great Steaks and the dessert was great. Great selection of wines!,1
1043,1043,Had a great dining experience here the other night. We enjoyed the holiday menu the Dal Rae offered as well as martini's. The food was excellent. We've been here before and we'll be back again. The Dal Rae never disappoints.,0
1044,1044,Food was great service fair at best..,1
1045,1045,"A friend and I go to the Dal Rae every year for lunch for the holidays. I'm sure that the restaurant is happy to be more popular each year, but it has gotten too crowded. Too many office parties there is not room to get around the long center tables. Wait staff is banging into each other and all booths and tables are crammed together. So, what used to be a festive atmosphere has become too loud. The food however, has improved. Both the presentation and taste have been better the past two years. I had the pork tenderloin on the visit and it was superb. So were the mashed potatoes and asparagus. Everything was cooked perfectly. The service has always been excellent, but I felt badly for the staff because of the crowded atmosphere",0
1046,1046,"Enjoyed a wonderful night out with the wife, food was perfect along with the service.",1
1047,1047,"Expect a crowd in December as groups of all kinds (heavily skewed towards the over-50 demographic) come in to celebrate the holidays. This makes for slower overall service and long waits between courses. Our party of 4 arrived & were seated at 12:15 (Dec 16), and finished at 2:30pm. And that's not because we WANTED a sloooooow lunch.

The place sparkles with lights and decorations, and food remains consistently well-prepared. A limited holiday menu helps the kitchen cope with prep, & still manages an impressive range of dishes. Expect to pay $32 (at lunch) for filet mignon, with salads a la carte at $7.95 and up. Blackened swordfish was too dry, though the papaya salsa helped moisten it. Salads served on chilled plates w/chilled forks.",0
1048,1048,Perfect dinner night out.,1
1049,1049,"There isn't much old school left in SoCal, but this place in the middle of foodie nowhere is shockingly good. And packed at lunch. Had great sand dabs. Lots of fun. Go while it's still around.",0
1050,1050,"Love this place, but be prepared to wait. With reservations, still had to wait to be seated 30 minutes past our reservation time, and we were 10 minutes early. Once seated, we also had to wait awhile for our order to be taken and for our food to come. That being said, love the food and place so much, we keep going back.",0
1051,1051,Such a great restaurant. I love the way the decorate for the Holidays. We love the Thanksgiving dinner.,1
1052,1052,Our steaks were cooked to perfection. The filet was melt-in-your mouth good and the prime rib was to die for! We will definitely be back. Next time... Chilean sea bass. It looked heavenly.,0
1053,1053,"Living by the beach with plenty of other restaurants in the area...yet we trek to the Dal Rae for the consistently excellent food, service and the ""old"" ambiance. I think the privately owned restaurant with the owner present and greeting you makes a difference to us.",0
1054,1054,Must try the Chilean Sea Bass. My filet mignon was a little under cooked for medium was more like rare but I still enjoyed it.,0
1055,1055,"We eat at Del Rae 3-4 times a year. We consider Del Rae the best combination of quality food, great ambiance and value. Our last visit, the restaurant was packed and service slipped a little but the overall experience was still solid.",0
1056,1056,Food was really good but service was just o.k. Maybe next time we shouldnt go on a Friday. But overall we really enjoyed it.,1
1057,1057,Old time steakhouse atmosphere. Staff was very attentive.,0
1058,1058,"My best friend treated me to dinner here, our first visit after 15 or 20 years. Why did we wait? There's no good reason. It's the kind of place that speaks to us. I can't speak to the wine list as I brought a bottle, but the filet was large. I took half home. The baked potato was fine, although my preference is when there's notable salt on the skin. I recommend the table-side Caesar; be aware they drop a raw egg into the mix. My favorite moment, however, is when the crudite tray comes out. The picks are wonderful. And the souffle was terrific.",0
1059,1059,"Fantastic. Great old time steakhouse. Forget the trendy places, give here a try!",1
1060,1060,"This was the perfect spot to celebrate our 1st year anniversary. We had the pepper steak, prime rib, ceasar salad and a few select glasses of red wine. My family has been coming to the Dal Rae for decades and it never disappoints!",0
1061,1061,"Both food and service are incredible. Pricey, but worth every cent-especially if it is a special occassion.",0
1062,1062,Had a wonderful Saturday evening dinner experience with friends. Loved the entertainment in the bar and service was excellent. The perfect night out. Will be back! Everyone loved the food and the atmosphere was terrific!,0
1063,1063,"Wonderful ""old school"" restaurant. The tomato salad I had was below par for a restaurant of this caliber, but their signature sea bass entree was excellent. We were there on a week night and the place wasn't that crowded. However, our group of 4 was seated at a table in the middle of the room that was a bit cramped. The service was very good.",0
1064,1064,favorite steakhouse does not disappoint thank you for being consistent..,1
1065,1065,"A great steakhouse experience with old world charm. The food portions are large enough to serve two.
Wine list is standard fare.",1
1066,1066,"This establishment has been around forever and they are deserving of praise for many traditional aspects -- highlights included table side Caesar Salad which was outstanding and marvelous cheese garlic bread which is to die for. Scampi recipe was well done, but Scrimp was frozen. Dessert was top notch. Overall, a most pleasant experience.",0
1067,1067,"Prime rib was very tender and tasty.
Duck 'la orange was tasty but meat was tough and a little dry.
I've eaten there many times thre the years, so I'll be back for sure, just won't order the duck.
I usually get the pepper steak which is a very delicious ribeye covered with green onion and black pepper.
Cocktails had plenty of alcohol........no skimping there.",0
1068,1068,"This is a classic ""old school restaurant"" -great food, great service, fantastic tableside Caesar Salads!",1
1069,1069,"I have been going to Dal Rae for several years, it is consistently good in every facet....service is excellent and the quality of the food and how it's prepared is the reason I go there.",1
1070,1070,"This is a time capsule of really good restaurants from the 50s and 60s. Lots of leather booths, and food classics like Oysters Rockefeller, iceburg wedge salad, frog legs and Lobster Thermador. Our server was friendly and efficient. Overall, a treat for all four of us celebrating a 73rd birthday.",0
1071,1071,"My parents love this restaraunt, so I take them two or three times each year for many years. For the first time in my history with Dal Rae, the bread crust was burnt (charcol colored and dry.) I showed it to our server and she said, ""That is the way it was delivered today."" To her credit, she took the basked and returned with what she called, ""The lightest loaf on the rack,"" still burnt, but not as bad as the first one. My suggestion: If a bakery truck tries to deliver burnt bread, send them back for a new load or find a better baker. This guest would have more appreciative if the staff served no bread and explained that they had to return the loaves to the baker because of an un-servable condition. Otherwise, the meal was fine.",0
1072,1072,"We celebrated our 33rd wedding anniversary at the Dal Rae!
We drove further than another nice restaurant we enjoy. No regrets! The prime rib was awesome!
I almost ordered the Diamond Jim cut. Good thing I didn't. The standard cut was massive and delicious.
We also enjoyed the live light pop music we could hear from the bar area.
Our waitress was excellent.
We'll be back!",0
1073,1073,"Food was good, service was good but menu very pricey for the area.",1
1074,1074,"Food was great. Section of restaurant where we were seated was very noisy. Tables were too close together, so much so that their advertised ""table-side preparation"" of certain items had to be done in the corner as there was no room next to the table. This has happened on several previous visits. Server was ""so-so"", have had better. Nice bar area with ""live"" music.",0
1075,1075,"Food is consistently pretty good. Relish tray is fun. Seating is very crowded -- aisles get blocked easily, chairs sometimes touching. We'll be back, though.",1
1076,1076,Food was great and not overpriced like the Beverly Hills restaurants but comparable quality. A lot of choices for picky eaters. Outside the place looks like a bowling alley but inside it's a lot better. Great service and offers table side service for certain items.,0
1077,1077,"Dal Rae is one of the remaining old school restaurants with a variety of fine dining dishes on their menu like Lobster Thermidor, double cut lamp chops, Veal Oscar, Chilean sea bass, various cuts of prime rib and filet mignon, etc. Although the woman who seated us seemed to be sleepwalking, our waitress (Jackie?) was superb. She was solicitous and gracious and knew when and how to pace our meal and see to our needs. The booths are ample red leather crescents that allow for quiet conversation. The linen tablecloths are kept clean by attentive bussing staff. We ordered cocktails and were also brought a relish tray of crisp raw veggies and basket of crisp breads and crackers. An excellent meal and experience. You can't go wrong w/Dal Ral.",0
1078,1078,"Impressive local gem. Had a wonderful hamburger of ground short ribs, sirloin and new York that was to die for! Chop Salad was quite tasty also. Will definitely return for a dinner with my husband.

We are foodies and love wine, but didn't have the chance to look at the wine list at my business lunch. I suspect it to be wonderful.

Warning - there is only valet parking so come with $3.50 in cash.",0
1079,1079,"Great food, service (once at our table), and entertainment at the bar. Also, great wine selection.",1
1080,1080,"Hidden gem that's been around for years. My local friends love this place and this was my second visit here. Staff was friendly and accommodating. From the hostess to the busboy - everyone had a smile on their face. The food was excellent. Along with a decent selection of wines and a full bar - can't go wrong! Not inexpensive, but you are definitely getting what you are paying for.",0
1081,1081,"Excellent food, great service, nice quiet elegant ambience.",0
1082,1082,Dal Rae has a retro charm. The service was very good. The prime rib and ribeye were delicious. We will definitely be going back.,0
1083,1083,"We love this place. Everytime we eat here, e aways say, why don't we come more often? Its like stepping into an old school steakhouse. Food is great. Any kind of black peppered steak is the way to go.",1
1084,1084,We made our reservation for 6:30 and we were seated when we arrived. We were seated in a banquet room which was unappealing and cold! My wife was looking forward to the Diamond Jim Brady Prime Rib but it was not on their Valentines Menu. There was nothing on their website regarding the limited Valentine's Day menu however the restaurant accomodated her. I had the filet. Delicious! The salad was basic; blue cheese outstanding! Rose; our waitress was great!,0
1085,1085,"I had heard many things about Dal Rae's but had not made the time to visit. We had a 7:30 reservation on a Sunday evening and were seated promptly with no delay. Our waitress arrived on point and brought out bread and a relish tray. We started our meal with the teriyaki tidbits, 4 double bite-sized, melt-in-your-mouth, pieces of filet topped with Ortega chili and melted jack cheese in a teriyaki sauce. The waitress also brought out a basket of warm, garlic cheese bread which was a little over toasted, in my opinion, but still very good. My wife and I both opted to try the filet mignon, I ordered the Dal Rae Pepper steak which came topped with a seasoned mix of pepper, bacon and green onion. The steak was excellent, as was the service.",0
1086,1086,Pepper steak still one of my favorites. Nice old-time atmosphere.,1
1087,1087,"I have been going to Dal Rae for over 30 years. This time was the unhappiest experience I have ever had. Something has changed in the preparation of the food. The Dal Rae chopped salad was the best chopped salad in California, now it tastes just like any chopped salad you can get at any restaurant, something was not the same. The frog legs were very small and mostly breading. I will still probably go there again because of its sentimental value to my wife and I. I proposed to her there 21 years ago. I hope it will be a better experience next time.",0
1088,1088,"I booked this reservation when Open Table sent me an email for ""Taste of LA"" with the $25-$35-$45 dinners. I forgot about the special by the night of our reservation, but evidently our server did as well. We were not offered a special menu, and our dinner bill was $350 for for people. Our server was efficient, but just a tad impatient with our 89 year old granddad. The food, as always was exceptional.",0
1089,1089,For a reasturant that is as old as I am they sure know how to keep their customers comming back. We certainly will.,1
1090,1090,Everything was great except wait time considering we had reservations.,1
1091,1091,"It was my Boyfriend's birthday his parents treated us to his favorite restaurant. The food was great the drinks where strong. After dinner we sat at the bar to listen to live music, whatch the Lakers game. It was a unforgettable night.",1
1092,1092,"you would never know that it was there. Its a old classic restaurant.

its not HOLLYWOOD but for the food and service it should defiantly be.

price for drinks good, appetizers yummy, they make the salad at your table, the peppered corn NY steak was amazing.

you are never rushed. great to take visiting family, holidays or a special event...",0
1093,1093,As always the del rae was great.,1
1094,1094,"If you've never been to the Dal Rae, it is an experience. Expect to be there from 1-1/2 hours for party of 4 to up 2 hours for larger parties. Everything was great. However, they did only have their ""Holiday Menu"" which is limited in choice. For the first time in the many years that I have been going there, I had to send my steak back. I asked for it butterflied well done. It came very pink on the inside. When I got it back it was then butterflied and well done, the way it should have been from the start (as the waitress said).",0
1095,1095,"Anyone will explain immediately that the Dal Rae is pricy. They will let you know how much they enjoy the food and the service. It is pricy but... service, food quality and flavor is excellent. During the hollidays it is very crowded. I do believe they set extra tables in the restaurant to accomodate the dinner parties. It is an annoyance as people; servers and patrons meander the tight spaces available between tables. Keep this in mind when booking a special place for the hollidays.",0
1096,1096,"I have been to the Dal Rae many times and always have a special time especially at Christmas. We were served by Kitty who was just a hoot! She is one of those old school waitresses and has probably worked there for 50 years.

My only complaint is that they seemed to have over booked their reservations and we wanted over an hour for a reservation that was made over an earlier (we also witnessed several parties that came in after us that were seated first. I donât know why this was but it almost caused us to leave). I think that the management needs to take into account that during the holidays diners will linger longer and to take fewer reservations.",0
1097,1097,"Beautiful holiday decorations make this time of year even more inviting. Classic ""steak house"" with staff which has mostly been there many years. Hand made Cesar salad done tableside is a nice touch not seen much any more. Peppercorn steak preparation on the New York or on the Filet are excellent.",0
1098,1098,Food and service was very good. Hostess seemed a little annoyed because we arrived early for our reservation.,0
1099,1099,"when I walked in,it reminded me of place the ratpack would hang out. what a gem of a place.",1
1100,1100,"Overall we had a great time but took a long time for them to take our order and we didn't eat for like an hour from the time we sat down. Ate so much bread was full to finish food. I know it's a busy time of year but should have enough servers. Although, really enjoyed our company and atmosphere.",0
1101,1101,Service at lunch was absolutely dreadful!,1
1102,1102,"Had to down grade the sevice due to the wait. Had reservations and was directed to my seat. But i would have had to share a booth with another couple directly in front of me. Not what i wanted for my anniversary. But made the best of it in the bar. Once seated though, the waitress did a great job. And the food is always amazing. Overall, it was a great experience.",0
1103,1103,"The food is always very good at Dal Rae. They start you off with a ""on the house cold plate"" of fresh radishes, hot cherry peppers, celery..."". I have had the veal, steak and fish dishes and have bever been disappointed. The chocolate souffle' is outstanding! The deco is like something out of the past -thick drappery, dark, lots of half moon booths-but very lovable.",0
1104,1104,"The service was incredible! Server (Michelle, i think) noticed when water needed refilling, was helpful and knowledgeable about menu items and when we couldnt decide whether to have the chocolate mousse or the Grand Marnier mousse, said we could have half and half.The food..not so good this time. I always forget that the portions are HUGE, i ordered the sand dabs and the plate came PILED with 4-5 of them in a mound. not particularly appetizing, as the sauce only coated the top fish. Also ordered the garlic mash taters and the garlic was excessive. I love garlic, but i am not a vampire who needs killing! The bread, as always, was wonderful..both the garlic bread with the meal and the plain white artisan bread with the table pickles.",0
1105,1105,"Sad that they no longer have a dress code. Man came in wearing shorts, tank top, and flip flops and they seated him.",0
1106,1106,"My husband & I live in a neighboring city & love to enjoy a romantic dinner together at the Dal Rae. We started with oysters rockafeller & ceasar salad for two. Then our main entree, the surf & turf. Everything was excellent as usual!",0
1107,1107,Great food. Great catch-of-the-day selectionl.,1
1108,1108,"It was our second time to Dal Rae's and we loved it the first time. However, this time around, it was a little dissapointing. The steaks were delicious, but my potato was a little undercooked. Now, the waitress did offer to give me a new one, but I didn't want to wait any longer since I was starving and didn't want my steak to go cold. The reason I was starving was because we had a reservation for 7:30 but didn't get seated until 8:30. And it took about 30 minutes for the food to come out. So by this time, it was around 9:30 when the food came out. However, I have to say that the waitress was great and I don't think she had anything to do with food taking so long to come out.

Having said all this, we'll give it another chance.",0
1109,1109,"I would suggest that servers receive training in rules of etiquette, particularly in a restaurant of this caliber. Had we not been celebrating a birthday, we would have most definitely walked out.",0
1110,1110,"Been going to the Dal Rae for years as my husband's company was close. We met friends from Newport Beach there as a half/way restaurant for both of us. Service was truly poor, which is unusual but there didn't seem to be enough wait staff for the customers. Food as always was wonderful with a good selection. Drinks are well poured. I have no qualms about going to the Dal Rae for dinner. I think we had an off night as to service.",0
1111,1111,"the service was excellent. i was very impressed with the staff. it did take a little long for our salad to come out. and also a bit for our main dinner to come out. but it was nice enviroment, making the wait not so bad. I have already recommended the place to others. we had a nice romantic anniversary dinner.",0
1112,1112,Dal Race's doesn't disappoint. Consistently good food and friendly service.,0
1113,1113,"Went here for my Birthday dinner. A nice place for a special occasion. They did have a little problem with my payment method, the waitress input my Visa Gift card in as a Del Rae gift card. On our way home from the nice dinner I received a call from the restaurant telling me I didn't play the complete total and didn't leave a tip. I was sure the visa gift card was good, but I apoligized and gave them my credit card number to cover the tab, which they had a problem with that, (they wrote it down wrong), called again. Finally figured out the orginal payment was valid and called apoligizing to me to let me know everythhing was okay.",0
1114,1114,It's like going to a high-end steakhouse back in the 1960's.,1
1115,1115,"Recently had a nice dinner with my wife at Dal Rae. Had been meaning to go for a while. It wasn't as reminiscent of Mad Men as some reviews would have you believe. Just a nice, classic decor and great service. Definitely geared towards an older crowd. Good, classic food for a special occasion or just for a nice evening out.",0
1116,1116,Very good overall. Excellent service. Food very good. A bit noisy for romantic. Quaint and nostalgic.,1
1117,1117,"Food was great, the interior is lovely, and there may not be another place in LA that so successfully captures the feel of 1950s American dining. On the downside, service on a Saturday was very slow, with an uncomfortably long gap between appetizers and dinner.",0
1118,1118,"It was my first time there, and was a great experience. Loved the cold veggie sampler at the beginning. Dine LA week made it great to have a little sampling of everything. Filet mignon melted in my mouth!",0

1120,1120,"the food was so-so here but the service was EXCELLENT! the wait staff was very attentive and for the dine LA deal, you got a lot for your money. only thing was the food was a little bland. the steak was beautiful but it needed a little kick.",0
1121,1121,"Dinner was great. Despite us having reservations, we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. It was a busy night though, since it was the first night of Dine L.A. It took about another 15 minutes for us to get menus and another 20-30 minutes for somebody to come by and take our order. Our reservation was at 7:30, and we didn't eat until about 8:45-9:00. But, after our waiter found out we were celebrating a birthday, she came by and brought a cake and candle.",0
1122,1122,Good cor business lunch but a little overpriced valet charge and parking not necessary should have a choice,1

1126,1126,"I love this place!! A step back in time, with the food and ambiance. Forget the diet and cholesteral concerns at this place, just enjoy! Pricey, but worth it!",1
1127,1127,A family favorite for 40 years. You simply won't go wrong at the Dal Rae. I highly recommend the pepper steak which is unlike any other you may have had.,0
1128,1128,"Everything was WONDERFUL at our dinner. The food was perfect, the waitress was lovely, and the ambiance was perfect. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because, even though we had a reservation, we weren't seated until 15 minutes after the scheduled time. We got there 10 minutes early, so we ultimately waited 25 minutes to sit down. They were kind about it, but we still would've liked to sit down at our scheduled time.
We definitely will return however, since this establishment is so divine.",0
1129,1129,"Major old school establishment way out of LA proper. If you are looking for a Las Vegas sized meal this is the place to come to. The menu is vast and varied, they can cook practically anything anyway and the wait staff is fantastic. The food is real good, a wonderful place to share plates, the portions are big. Only down side was the staff at the front desk, but that isn't a reason to stay away.",1
1130,1130,"Great food, great staff, and great atmosphere! Bananas Flambe' for desert is the way to go. Prepared tableside makes for a great presentation. Spinach Wilted salad also prepared tableside and very delicious. Menu is full of great dishes that will satisfy every craving~",1

1132,1132,"I really enjoyed our dinning experience, food was excellent! I would definitely recomend the Rockerfeller Ostyers, they were amazing! The petite peppercorn filet was amazing as well. Next time I would request to sit and eat in the bar , loved the guy that was singing.
Our dinning area was a little cramped, everyone kept bumping into my chair. But overall really enjoyed the food and wine.",0
1133,1133,Good traditional steak house. No games or gimmicks just good food for the price,1
1134,1134,Server made the Caesar salad at the table which was nice. The food is way above average. I recommend the pepper filet. She handled water and wine glasses by the rims routinely :(. Very nice place with relaxing atmosphere. $310 for 4 adults and child; included drinks. Nice for special occasion.,0
1135,1135,"The Pepper Steak and Cesaer Salad were fabulous! I'm planning the next special occasion for the Del Rae so that I can try more of their other dishes. Of the desserts, I would go with the chocolate souffle (super delicious).",1
1136,1136,"We love the Dal Rae and go there for special occasions. The food and service are always fabulous, and this evening was no exception. The sea bass is outstanding and the sandabs with lemon and capers were excellent. The only drawback is that they have packed SO many tables in to the space that you feel crammed in like sardines. The wait staff does a herculean task of maneuvering between the tight space between tables. However, I felt like I had someone hovering behind me the entire night (not to mention bumping into me). I'm kind of surprised the fire marshall lets them put that many people in there!",0
1137,1137,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. It has an outstanding menu, and is a wonderful place. The service was a bit off this last time, but that's unusual. I highly recommend it!!",1
1138,1138,"Having visited the Dal Rae for many years, it's always nice to come ""home""- That's how you feel, everytime you stop in for lunch or dinner. As though you are one of the family. The staff is always thorough, thoughtful and helpful. Many have been with the restaurant for (easily) 10+ years so the consistency in service is appreciated. The menu is not avant garde, but a sterling reminder of fine dining, where the FOOD is excellent! Take a step back into a simpler time!",0

The food is from an elegant era and extremely difficult to find without traveling a distance of at least 40-50 miles from where we live in Orange County. It is always a treat to dine at the Del Rae and after they remodeled they made sure that it did not loose its character. We always try to go at least 2 to 3 times per year. My birthday, my husband's birthday and our wedding anniversary. Loren and his family always make one feel so very special while dining.",0
1142,1142,"Overall a really nice place with good food. It's great to know that places like this still exist. The menu is old-school all the way and features all the steakhouse classics. The place itself is nice too. I wasn't sure what to expect from the outside but it's been kept up on the inside and has an elegant, timeless feel. Unfortunately, I found the New Year's Eve ""prix fix"" menu to be very overpriced. Considering that I ordered the exact same thing I would have ordered any other night, I don't see why I had to pay such a large premium. They weren't really doing anything ""special"" for New Year's Eve - just jacking up the prices. On a regular night, I think the prices are fair for what you get. On a prix-fix night, it's overpriced.",0
1143,1143,"Service a little slow considering the restaurant wasn't as busy as expected for New Year's eve. However, I believe the restaurant was running on a skeleton crew. Keep hearing there was only one person doing dessert, cooking...etc. The food was good, but service was ok..",0
1144,1144,Have been there many time and it has alway been excellent. We were a group of 11 celebraing our son's 21 birthday and the service was very poor.,1
1145,1145,We made reservations for a Wednesday night and it was extremely busy. We were seated on time with reservations but it took about 10 to 15 minutes before our drink order was taken. We felt a little neglected by our waitress as she did not check back for 20 minutes after our drinks were empty to see if we wanted another. Our celebration was never acknowledged by the waitress. Each person at the table ordered a different entree. The food was very good even though it took a while before it was served. I would highly recommend the Chilean Seabass which was excellent!,0
1146,1146,"I had a very nice experience with my first time at Dal Rae so I took my family on Christmas Eve, which I expected to be crowded. We had to wait very long time but we were happy with the food, their filet pepper steak. The restaurant was very busy, especially being christmas eve, but our server tried her best to accommodate our needs. You just gotta avoid during the super busy time of the year.",0
1147,1147,"The Dal Rae manages to take you back to a happier time when three hour martini lunches were de rigueur. The bar with its sharply dressed bartenders warms my heart. The simple but excellently prepared food never disappoints. And the professional, attentive service - right up to the owners themselves, always keeps me coming back.",0
1148,1148,Decorated for Christmas. The restaurant is VERY festive.,1
1149,1149,Great food but the customer service is not always there.,1
1150,1150,Restaurant good valet parking rude,1
1151,1151,"Good Food, Great service, but a little over priced for lunch.",1
1152,1152,"This was a first date and it was by far one of the best resturants I have been to in the ""eastern Los Angeles"" area. She drove in from the OC, I was at Griffith Park so it was very fair for a 1/2 way point. It is not inexpensive, but overall, it was worth the $100.00 for 2 people. The service was good if not a bit fun. Give it a try!",0
1153,1153,Premier spot in Pico Rivera. You feel like you're dining 50 years ago. Treated very well.,1
1154,1154,Dal Rae has always been a favorite. Food & service were excellent. The waitress was attentive to our needs and the pace of the meal was perfect. It's a great place for a special occasion.,0
1155,1155,An incredible feast for the foodies. Very busy and loud. Tight quarters. Great service.,1
1156,1156,I LOVED the retro style menu. I had the Lobster Thermidor -tons of lobster perfectly cooked and the sauce was extreemly tasty-not the saltiness that I have found at other places. The chocolate souffle was fluffy/silky and was quite possibly the best dessert I have ever had. Will be returning on my next busines trip in February!,0
1157,1157,We took friends here for their first time and they loved the old school vibe the restaurant had. The food and service were awesome. We were able to split entrees without any hassle and our server was attentive.,0
1158,1158,"The food is great; however, the wine service needs improvement.",1
1159,1159,"Classic Old California steak house! Perfectly cooked, traditional flavors and large portions. The boys L*O*V*E it, and the girls can find plenty to be eat. Table side preparation of the Caesar Salad, and the fruit parfaits is a luxury of presentation missing from trendy food scene. Returns dining to a luxury experience to be savored.",0
1160,1160,"As always, Dal Rae is a great place to eat, relax and enjoy old school service.",1
1161,1161,"Excdellent service, Ceasar salad was great. Overall a great experience",1
1162,1162,"The waitress was very attentive and gracious.

The person that mixed the salad at the table and also slice the roast at the table needs some training. part of the ambiance of ordering the salad for two to be mixed and served at the table is to see the waiter doing and service the mix aas well as with the roast for two; the waiter doing these two items stood almost at the next booth rather than in front of our booth-clearly not acceptble. Also suggest that when ceaser salad they should offer real anchoives rather than paste or tiny pieces that are not detectable.",0
1163,1163,"We wanted a good steak dinner for our anniversary and found reviews for Dal Rae just by chance and decided we had to try it. It definately didn't dissappoint. We go there before our reservation time, they were willing to seat us right away, but we decided we wanted to have a drink in the bar and enjoy the piano bar and a martini (they are great, just as everyone says) When we were seated we were taken care of right away, yes you do have to ask for the garlic bread and its a must, we had the Ceaser Salad, I had Seabass and my husband had the Pepper steak all were wonderful and cooked perfectly. We loved this place it was worth the drive and can't wait for a speical occassion to go back!",0
1164,1164,"Best Prime Rib ever. Always consistent great flavor, tender and juicy.",0
1165,1165,The food at Dal Rae is fantastic. The only complaint I ever have is that we always feel rushed.,1
1166,1166,"Met friends in beautiful downtown Pico Rivera and enjoyed the restaurant immensely. Drinks at the bar were good, although the bartender seemed in a sour (and I'm not talking whiskey) mood. We had reserved a booth and had a wonderfully professional and friendly waitress. Salads were excellent and all the entrees (fish, chicken and steak) were much enjoyed. We will be back.",0
1167,1167,"A step back in time...the 50's and 60's are alive and well in this bustling restaurant. Extensive menu, generous portions, honor reservations...comfortable and welcoming.",0
1168,1168,Very nice dinner spot. My wife and I had been wanting to try it for years and we were not dissapointed. The lobster thermidor is outstanding and the medallions are very tasty albeit slightly dry even cooked to medium. It seems dated but with character. Overall a very good experience.,1
1169,1169,"The ambiance is mid-century steak House, but they offer a great list of fresh fish. Great booths which feel very private even in group discussion. Unfortunately I ordered the halibut grilled, which was served overdone, charred and dry. They redid my order without any improvement, and I finally switched to the Chilean Seabass ala Ben, which I definitely recommend. It's the house specialty style of pan seared with a lite cheese crust and topped with carmalized Maui onions. Ultimately they took it of the bill without me asking them to.Very professional and friendly service!",0
1170,1170,Dal Rae is a classic with a fantstic menu,1
1171,1171,"old fashion blue hair restaurant but boy some good food , and surprising happening bar scene with lots of cougars hanging at the piano.  To be honest this is a classy place with a 50s vibe of old Los Angeles  the food is sharable as it is a lot for one . But the quality is superior. recommended.",0
1172,1172,"This restaurant is in our top five favorites(maybe #1?). The food & service are exceptional. A great dining experience. (Note: on the night we were recently there, the normally perfect service was not up to par. Still, a great experience)",0
1173,1173,"I thought the service was terrific. My martini & caesar salad were spot on, but I was a bit disappointed with my duck in that the skin was not crispy and seemed a bit over-cooked and dry before it was put in the sautÃ© pan for warming. My friend's petrale sole was also over cooked. I would guess the steaks and other red meat dishes are their forte and I look forward to trying them in the future.",0
1174,1174,"I made the reservation on OpenTable, requesting a large booth as there were 4 adults. We were put in a booth that would have fit 3 comfortably. We requested a larger booth but was told by the hostess none were available and that they were all reserved. Two larger booths were still open when we left. Disappointed we were literally crammed into a smaller booth. Owner of restaurant aware.",0
1175,1175,"One of the things about Dal Rae that has irritated me for years is the music vibe at the piano bar. Obviously, the music can be heard in the dining room. Many people have considered Dal Rae to be a throwback of the 50's and 60's steakhouses, and I wish that was the case. To me, the music at the piano bar makes the experience less romantic and appealing. The Dresden has Marty and Elaine. They make the place what it is, and I love it. Where do the Smith Brothers go to find their weekly entertainment? If there isn't any good entertainment, Sinatra and Co. would be more than welcome.",1
1176,1176,"we had a wonderful lunch at Dal Rae! it's a little expensive for lunch. soup and salad should come with your meal, but they don't. it's kind of a pricey add on for what you get. also, the valet charge for parking your own car is a little strange, i thought. all in all, you will enjoy this restaurant, i really liked the ambiance. great for a special occasion!",0
1177,1177,Just a great place to meet centrally and have a wonderful dinner!,1
1178,1178,French onion soup and pepper steak where the best!!,1
1179,1179,A very surprising find. Was seated right on time for our reservation. Menu was limited due to Valentines Day but still many quality selections available. Signature dish was the pepper steak which was incredible! Great service even w/a packed house. Hope to come back & try other items from the menu. Overall it was a pleasant experience. Valet service ($3.50) was quick & friendly.,0
1180,1180,The food was delicious and the signature dish to try is the peppered filet mignon! Warning:it's pretty spicy with some kick due to the pepper but nonetheless delicious:) The ambiance is nice/romantic for a group or a dinner for two. In the bar/lounge there is a pianist/singer who plays very mellow music setting the perfect dining atmosphere (and she plays requests..Frank Sinatra was her specialty). The only complaint that I had was the mood of the staff. I understand it was busy but can somebody smile for me please?!?! I was really disappointed from start to finish that we were never once greeted with a friendly smile. It just would have been nice to see ONE person smile because it makes a difference in the service and experience.,0
1181,1181,"The pepper crusted steak melted in my mouth. This was a jolt of supernatural proportions, I had no idea my tongue was having a party with my taste buds. The waitress was friendly and enjoyable. The atmosphere was classic and cozy. I enjoyed their Argentinian red wine, such a delight! This restaurant is a must on your buccket list. Remember, you only live once......live a little:-)",0
1182,1182,Consistent good-quality steaks and food.,1
1183,1183,Simply delicious. Was some of the best food I've ever tasted. The bread pudding was spectacular. I really liked the pepper steak method of preparation. Great baked potatoes.....not microwaved. Just overall a really incredible dining experience. Seasoned wait staff are at the top of their game. I'd go again in a heartbeat. Cathy,0
1184,1184,"I am going to be honest at first I hesitated to go inside...a lot had to do with the restaurant's location. However, once inside the restaurant the service, food and atmosphere was great. I enjoyed my time while being at the restaurant. The outside was nothing compare to the inside. I will definitely return again.",0
1185,1185,"Great food, friendly staff, and awesome ambiance.",1
1186,1186,Always a great place for food and drinks. A real throw back to the old steakhouses. As soon as you walk into the bar you want to order a dry martini. The sea bass is the BEST!,0
1187,1187,"You won't find fusion food here, but solid preparations of classics like prime rib, herbed lamb chops, and a variety of seafood. Bleu cheese salad dressing is rich and creamy, and salads are served on chilled plates. Get tomatoes (sliced hot house ones with minimal flavor, it's true) instead of potatoes to cut the calorie load of these hefty portions. The gold brick sundae features two scoops of creamy ice cream inside a carmelized lace cookie, topped with chocolate sauce that freezes into a hard topping. Yum. Service is usually very good (though I had the worst waitress ever anywhere a few weeks ago).",0
1188,1188,"I went for my third time on Christmas Eve with family and we had an absolute blast. The restaurant is so much fun (it is wonderful at Christmas time) and the food is really, really good. Best Caesar in town, frankly. And the Oysters Rockefeller are incredible. I had a wonderful Filet, and one person had the most decadent sea bass imaginable. And the drinks are strong and reasonable!",0
1189,1189,Classic restaurant - good food and service. 1960's menu of good dining American classic food.,1
1190,1190,very dissapointed in the cesar salad.,1
1191,1191,"outstanding customer service and great food :)
we would definitely dine there again!",0
1192,1192,"Overall, Dal Rae was excellent and it was like stepping back into time. The popularity of the restaurant is amazing considering the longevity of the restaurant and its location which is not exactly easy to get to. Our server, Kitty, was charming and is obviously old school.
They know how to prepare steak and will cook it exactly as you requested it. This is a solid steakhouse and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a classic steakhouse rather than a contemporary steakhouse.",0
1193,1193,"The evening got started on the wrong foot. It took 20 mins before anyone asked us if we wanted water or anything to drink. All of the other tables had their drink and a bread basket and we had nothing. I asked a couple of waitresses for help, but they just said, ""let me find out what's going on"" and did not come back. Right before we were about to leave, our waitress finally appears and apologozes for the confusion. She was not aware that we were her table. She made up for it the rest of the evening. The food was excellent. I recommend the peppered steak and the duck. They're escargo is the best I've had in So. Cal.",0
1194,1194,Love the ambiance - old world (boys' club) feel with live jazz piano. Very slow service despite there not being very many customers.,0
1195,1195,Great food--super mashed potatoes. Nice maitre d' and waitress. Dining room is a little loud.,1
1196,1196,"As one has come to expect, food was very good. Service was a tab below expectations, but it may have been due to the fact that the restaurant became busy during its ""rush"" hour.",1
1197,1197,"This is a throwback to mid century dining- three martini lunches and waiters who weren't actors. Windows are covered so you lose track of time. Where else can you find lobster thermador?? The crudite plates are served on ice and the drinks are stiff. This is total Mad Men!! Can't say that the front desk is exactly warm and inviting, but the wait staff makes up for the scary greeting..",1
1198,1198,"The food was good, but a little heavy on butter and pricey. Gran marnier souffle for dessert to die for! Meat cooked perfectly. Excellent, friendly service. Will defintely go back for special occasions.",0
1199,1199,This is a great place for special occasions (mine was a treat for my girlfriends 65th Birthday). Keep in mind this restaurant is VERY expensive: a french dip sandwich was $19.95 at lunch. I can only imagine the dinenr prices! That does not count in valet parking.,0
1200,1200,"We have been patronizing Dal Rae's for over 25 years and have found the food (menu selection and preparation) and service wonderful (with one exception when they were admittedly having a problem in the kitchen). Unfortunately, the noise level affects the ambience. But Dal Rae's is always the standard against which we judge all restaurants except those that serve ethnic foods.",1
1201,1201,"This was my first time eating at Del Rae and I was completely satisfied. Our waitress was outstanding and the overall service was fantastic. I would definitely recommend the Pepper steak and the blackened swordfish. In regards to side dishes, try the mac n' cheese and the garlic mashed potatoes.",0
1202,1202,"I have been to the Dal Rae many times and the food is excellent. Unfortunately, our server was new and didn't quite get the order correct. The manager was aware and she did her best to redeem herself by bringing an extra dessert. It would have helped to know that the Steak Diane takes longer to prepare than other meals. We had to wait but it was divine.",0
1203,1203,"The Dal Rae is like a blast from the past.  Think the late 50's and a joint that the Rat Pack would hang at.  The menu, drinks, and atmosphere are all classic as is the service.  On my last visit to the Dal Rae the service was not up to par which was unusual.  Make sure to order the Caesar tableside.  Best traditional Caesar that I've ever had.  Well worth a visit!",1
1204,1204,"I ordered prime rib and although it was delicious, it was brought to me as medium.  I had ordered medium-rare and I even noted it to the waitress when she brought it to the table.  Everything else was very good.  I have eaten here several times and it is usually a little better.",0
1205,1205,Romantic dinner celebrating anniversary. Veal was excellent. Teriyaki chicken breast was a real/whole breast.,0
1206,1206,"A little old and dated decor but the food is quite good. The lobster thermidor is excellent though the prices can be a little on the high side. I didn't get my points from opentable either, not that it matters. The place can be romantic if you get a server that cares. It's been hit and miss for me. good luck!!!",1
1207,1207,"I've eaten here many times over the past several years and they never disappoint. Consistent service, food and experience. Old-world dining ambiance.",0
1208,1208,"Everything was good except receptionist being rude and person who packing food for left over, he was such in hurry.
But especially receptionist so rude. They don't care people coming in n out.
That definitely ruin the perfect night.",0
1209,1209,"The onions on the pepper steak were a little burnt, but it was still perfection.",0
1210,1210,"Dal Rae has been a family favorite for decades. the food is still as good as ever. the sea bass was the best we've ever had and the filet mignon was amazing. Valet parking costs you $3.50 plus tip. Service was excellent. A bit noisy, but it was packed for Mother's Day. Calamari appetizer was excellent and a generous portion. Try the ice cream and fresh berries dessert....so good!",0
1211,1211,"MY wife and I were there to celebrate our 15th yr. anniversary and it was all worth it!! As many times that we have passed through the area I had never paid attention to Dal Rae until Saturday evening. Helga was our waitress and she was the best of the best. Our compliments to the chef, the foor was delicious....we are already planning another date at Dal Rae. Thank you!!",0
1212,1212,"A long standing favorite. The perfect place for my wife and I to celebrate 22 years of marraige. Great food, great atmosphere, great service.",0
1213,1213,We've been to the Dal Rae many times and have never been disappointed. Food has always been delicious and cooked to our specifications.,1
1214,1214,"Caesar salad, made in the kitchen not tableside, had way too much dressing. Crab cakes were drowned in sauce. Club sandwich and lamb salad were very good.",0
1215,1215,Can never go wrong at the Dal Rae!,1
1216,1216,"This place is old school. We had Cesear Salad tableside. The right way. Our waitress, Pat, was great. Sort of like ""Flo"" at a diner. She had us laughing all night. Not hard to do on some pretty stiff drinks. I had seabass and it was cooked perfect. My guest had peppercorn steak that was wonderful.",0
1217,1217,"Very good food and good service, a bit overprice but good overall",1
1218,1218,Dinner was above expectations. The filet mignon was tender and delicious. A hint of pepper. Service was good. The butter limon sauce was tasty. The chocolate souffle was sweet and delicious. It was firm and moist inside.,0
1219,1219,"Dal Rae is a great place for a date or simply a nice dinner out with anyone. The meal pricing is expensive on any normal day but I dined at Dal Rae during dine week LA. The 3 course meal offered at only $34 dollars is a steal. I had the Ahi Tuna on toasted bread, it was delicious, followed by whitefish topped with caramelized onions and a sweet sauce that was to die for. For dessert I had the sundae cookie ice cream, it was only so-so. Overall, I enjoyed my meal at Dal Rae and would most likely come back next time for dine week LA. Parking required valet, which is $3.50. Dress is casual nice.",0
1220,1220,"We always go 2-3 times yearly, never a bad meal or bad service.",1
1221,1221,"Good food. Old-time, upscale dining. Excellent service. Our waitress had worked there 32 years!",1
1222,1222,"Classic throwback in the very best sense. Food is great and very reasonable (fantastic swordfish including sides under $20, filet under $30. Wait staff has been there for years, so they are well informed and have a friendly, casual, but professional familiarity.",0
1223,1223,"Always good. Welcomed and courteous greeting, manager drops by your table to ensure all is fine, food is delicious, well presented and affordably priced.",0
1224,1224,Good! was last there approx. 25-30 years ago and it was as goood this time as i remember,1
1225,1225,"Great dining experience, great food, and excellent service combine to make it a special evening.",1
1226,1226,The only thing missing from using the Open Table medium to make reservations is the ability to ask for a specific waitress/waiter of choice.,1
1227,1227,"The Del Rae is an older, established restaurant. Our food was excellent, service equally as good. It was filled with holiday diners and the only flaw I found was an extremely limited menu which contained just a handful of items. The old favorites didn't appear. I understand this because of the holiday season, but one of our party was hard pressed to find a suitable meal. Otherwise, the caesar salad is a classic, the scampi spectacular as well..",0
1228,1228,"Food was not as good as it had been in the past, but maybe that was because it was the holidays and the restraunt was very crowded. I have been there many times and this was not its best. The piano bar was good while we waited. I was disappointed that even with reservations, I still had to wait 45 mintues.",1
1229,1229,I am never disappointed when I eat here. This place is a treasure fro the area thats worth traveling to.,1
1230,1230,The service was excellent!! Food is delicious and the atmosphere is warm and friendly. Would definitely return again for more.,1
1231,1231,"This place is a regular stop for us. Always great food & service. Only complaint this time
was I didn't have change for Valet so I gave a $20 at the car desk & asked for change. My car comes out, opens the door & expects me to drive off. I ask for my change he talks to the other valet & gives me $16 back. I give him a dollar tip. The Valet charge is $3.50
I don't mind giving the valet $6 or $7 but I want it to be my decision.",0
1232,1232,"The food is always great, especially the steak and the chilean sea bass ""a la Ben."" Reservations are highly recommended and on this occasion, the food took a long time to come out because it was busy, so if you are in a hurry, don't eat at this restaurant on a Friday night.",0
1233,1233,"Although we have been to Dal Rae many times, we went there to experience DineLA pre fixe dinner. DineLA website did not mention that they do not offer the deal on fridays. Have we known that they did not offer the menu on fridays, we would have made our reservation on another day. We ended up ordering from the regular menu spending more than we wanted. Waitress told us if we wanted to leave after finding out that they do not have it on fridays. How can we leave? We drove all the way from San Juan Capistrano to Pico Rivera.

We like Dal Rae, we would go back but DineLA should mention that they do not offer the specials on specific days.

Food, service all overall experience at Dal Rae is excellent. Mario Batali needs to eat at Dal Rae.",0
1234,1234,"the service here is SUPERB and VERY professional. the waitress was very genuine and kind and i loved her! (mary jane). the food was always prompt with every course, they scrap your bread crumbs in between. even after all our dessert and we had already paid when my dad mentioned it was my and my brother's birthday she brought us cake.. appetizers were great so was the garlic cheese toast.. get the pepper steak.. of all entrees it was best... definitely an enjoyable experience",1
1235,1235,We always enjoy Dal Rae's and we weren't disappointed. Their anniversary special was very popular and the place was filled on a Tuesday night. Good for them. The owners came by to say hi to everyone and to make sure they were happy. That is a very nice touch. The food was very good and the drinks generous. All 6 of us had a good time.,0
1236,1236,Most excellent food and service. The sea bass was to die for...,1
1237,1237,"The food was great! Our server was awesome. The only thing that bothered me is that we were near the area all the servers hung out and they talked and gossiped the whole time. It was a bit annoying to be at a very nice restaurant and have to hear 4-5 servers stand around and gossip. Other than that, it was wonderful!",0
1238,1238,"My boyfriend and I celebrated his 30th birthday with a fancy dinner at Dal Rae. The food was good, but I expected more in terms of taste. The lobster was average and the steak was alright. The service was excellent overall. On my reservation I asked for the restaurant to present my boyfriend with a banana sufle and a birthday song. Well the hostess understood that it was suppose to be a surprise, but the waitress did not. She recomended that my boyfriend order a ""petite filet mignon"" if he was planning on having the banana sufle. My boyfriend just turned to me puzzled and asked, ""What banana sufle?"" I simply turned to the waitress and informed her that it was suppose to be a surprise. Other than that, we had a good time.",0
1239,1239,Food was incredibly good and the service was excellent as well.,1
1240,1240,very good experience as well as food and wine. will visit again for sure.,1
1241,1241,"A bit pricy but worth every bite. The scene is on the mature side. Can't miss for date night,romantic or that special birthday or anniverary. I not sure who's in the kitchen but after 10 dinner experiences, I would go again.

1242,1242,Service by the waitress was not quite up to par with the usual helpful and welcoming attitudes of other servers.,1
1243,1243,"Wasn't excited about my Cesear Salad, but my lunch companion loved his sea bass.",1
1244,1244,Great dinner. Wonderful service. Consistantly great food. Big ash tray at the front door with nasty stale tobacco stench is a real turn-off. The smell carries into the restaurant.,0
1245,1245,"An institution in Pico Rivera, what can be said that hasn't already been stated about the famous Dal Rae... bit of a trip into a time machine, even the waitresses put on the sass that gives it that throwback feel to 1950's Hollywood. You're not here for the heart-healthy vegan offerings; their famous pepper steak is worth the trip alone. Definitely make a point of going there at least once; I'd go back again, but wouldn't make a frequent habit of it; who can afford to, the tab is not recession-friendly.",0
1246,1246,Great Food!! One of LA's best kept secrets!!,1
1247,1247,"A great experience as always. We did for the first time have an appetiser that we were not thrilled with, but everything else was wonderful. Truly one of our favorites and we will be back.",0
1248,1248,"a reminder of the good old times, during the frenetic saloon days that offered up generous portion of excellent american fare... the steaks were delicious and the seafood fresh... i especially enjoyed the pasta dishes and would not hesitate to sample the many other dishes from the extensive menu...",0

1250,1250,friendly and prompt service. Food is consistently very good.,0
1251,1251,"This is a restaurant that is consistent in the quality of its food and service. An older restaurant with a homey yet elegant atmosphere, the wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable and very helpful in assisting the customers with their choices. I've returned to this restaurant several times to host out-of-town and out-of-country guests who want a taste of good American/Continental food. In particular, their beef choices are high quality and deliciously prepared every time and some of their signature appetizers, such as the ahi on toast points, and their entrees have always been excellent. The garnish tray is a wonderful ""old time"" touch and the cheesy bread is to die for! I would highly recommend this restaurant.",0
1252,1252,"my reservations were for valentines day. sure, i do understand they were busy. i did get there 10 minutes late. so they told me to wait. i went to the bar to order drinks but nobody paid attention to me. i had to really catch their attention. after getting my bill, it was wrong. went back to see what was taking so long with the table, and the hostess told me the table had been ready for some time. they should have let us know, but they didnt. my partner went to the bar to get a couple of drinks after we had already sat down, and the bartender told him that we better tip him good next time. not such good customer service.food was great.",1
1253,1253,The peppered steak filet mignon is a must try!,0
1254,1254,"Much better experience than the last time we here. We were seated within 10 minutes of our 7:30 reservation (we waited almost 1 hour the last time!). Our server Rose greeted us in a timely matter and made sure our experience would be better than before. We did not wait long for our appetizer and entrees. We did not feel rushed or hurried. Overall, we enjoyed our romantic Valentine's Day dinner.",0
1255,1255,"Being Vaentine's Day, the menu was restricted and the place was very busy. These things tended to diminish the overall experence. My Filet was undercoooked which I attribute to the semi-bedlam of the evening. I feel that the restaurat is really better than it showed on that Saturday night. I was a little upset that they did not have my reservation and happy that I had printed it out from my computer. None the less, we were promptly seated at a nice booth. I recommend Dal Rae.",0
1256,1256,"I really enjoyed my experience at Del Rae. If you would like some ideas on what to try here you go: Cesar Salad, Prime Rib,Pepper Steak, and then as a side choose the Garlic Mash. If you would like to try sea food try the Lobster thermidor or scallops A La Ben. The ambiance was excellent and wasn't too noisy. Take someone you love and enjoy yourself.",0
1257,1257,"Although the food was great as always, I was not pleased that my husband and I were seated in a room which had two large parties celebrating birthdays. We were looking forward to a nice quite dinner which was ruined by the noisy parties near us.",1
1258,1258,This is a retro throwback to the three martini crowd. (Like that's a bad thing?) The room is large and dark with no sign of external light - lose track of hours and martinis. The food is classic-picture duck l'orange prpared tableside or lobster thermidor. The relish tray is a treat- ice cold crudites served up front with the bread. It's a genuine old school treasure.,0
1259,1259,"Both the food and service was excellent at Dal Rae. We had a really good dineLA lunch. Maybe weâll visit again for special occasion. One thing I didnât really like is that they only have valet parking. But other than that, I like Dal Rae a lot.",0
1260,1260,"Excellent night out, very good food.",1
1261,1261,"Service was outstanding. Food portions were generous and the quality of the food was excellent. Pepper filet mignon was tender and full of flavor. Orange sauce on the duck could have been cooked a tad longer to burn off the alcohol after it was flambÃ©ed. The duck was very moist and tender. Very formal, wood-paneled walls, and ""old school"" atmosphere would most likely appeal to an older/business crowd.",0
1262,1262,"The Del Rae is by all accounts, ""Old School"" dining at its best. The normal menu is very extensive, the ambiance has all the charm of an upscale 60's dinner house of yesteryear and the service is the best. It is well worth the trip for all those who live in the city. Make sure you use OpenTable for your reservation, otherwise, you will have a very long wait, but well worth it. We have been long time patrons and highly recommend this place to all.",0
1263,1263,Always a great dinner - the staff is very knowledgeable and helpful especially with dietary restrictions.,1
1264,1264,This restaurant is known for Business professionals and appears to attract mature clientele.,1
1265,1265,A+ experience.  This is a place where the food can always be relied upon.,1
1266,1266,"Overall, food was good.  We had the Tower of Fillet Mignon w/Shitake Mushroom.  That was great! The Lamb Chops...not so HOT! Speaking of HOT...I ordered a decaf coffee to have with my Bread Pudding, coffee was COLD.  Bread pudding was outstanding! Also, on the dress code, I was under the impression the restaurant asked for Business Casual.  I saw several people wearing jeans...that seems casual to me!  Nevertheless, it was nice!",0
1267,1267,"The owner came to our table for a chat following the meal. I not normally a meat eater, but tried one of their specialties which is ""pepper steak,""  and it was truely excellent.",0
1268,1268,"The group of three women in the booth next to us was very loud and obnoxious during our entire meal.  The Crab Louie salad was rather small. The ground steak with bleu cheese was wonderful, as was the Ahi salad.",0
1269,1269,I've been going there for many years and it is an excellent place for food and the service is really good. Amazing mashed potatoes and the lemon cake or strawberries dipped in chocolate with Grand Marnier for dessert are the best.,1
1270,1270,"I love Dal Rae and have been eating there for years, 20 to be exact. It was a holiday week-end and my usual order of ""a la Ben"" was not prepared as usual. The server was very accomedating.",1
1271,1271,Kimberly was an outstanding waitress.,1
1272,1272,"A true 1958 gem still unspoiled by time. A relaxing, enjoyable atmosphere, very good bar, excellent service and a unique and unusual menu featuring traditional restaurant fare such as Lobster Thermidor and Oysters Rockefeller, make visiting the Del Rae like opening a time capsule full of cherished treasures or a pleasant journey back to simpler, more civil times. I've loved the Dal Rae for years. It's a top notch steak and seafood house with the warm, hospitable glow of vintage neon. The Dal Rae is what people want in a restaurant not the pitiful excuse for restaurants and nation wide chains we are expected to accept. Long live the Dal Rae!",0
1273,1273,We'll be back........from Arcadia,1
1274,1274,"We have been going to the Dal Rae for over forty years and our special birthday dinner did not disappoint.  They use the freshest ingredients and the wait staff was attentive without being intrusive.  

I would recommend this as an old school fine dining experience that you don't find much today.",0
1275,1275,"Repeat visitor. Great old Hollywood feel. Classy and elegant without the stuffiness. Friendly staff. Great food! Love the ""tableside"" touches.",0
1276,1276,"Best steak restaurant for the price.  Why go to Mortons and pay a'la carte for everything when you get a Prime cut steak with every option included.  Never had a bad steak there and I have had a bad experience at more notable steakhouses.  Not the best location, but ignore the address and go for the food.",0
1277,1277,If you live or work in the area you have to go to the Dal Rae.  It is one of the original great steak houses that chains like Mortons try to imitate.  The food is good and the service is great. It takes you back in time and delivers a great experience.,0
1278,1278,food is outstanding,1
1279,1279,We liked the food and the service and we were very happy with our evening at the Dal Rey.  We will return soon.,1

1281,1281,O was somewhat disappointed with the Crab Louis Salad.  I've had better.  Not much of anything on it.  It was also fairly small to what I'm used to.,1
1282,1282,"A swingin' place thats a total flashback to the Rat Pack, in a ggod way.  The made at your table ceasar salad is amazing.",1
1283,1283,This place is a classic for old school style service and dining.  The Lobster Thermador was amazing and came in a generous serving.  And of course the steaks great - no wonder this place has been around so long.,0
1284,1284,"Went for my birthday, curious about restaurant that has been there forever, and was very happy about entire experience, food excellent, great and friendly service and love the authentic Mad Men vibe of the place.",0
1285,1285,Everything we ordered was delicious and service was amazing! Prime rib is definitely the same caliber to Lawryâs. Might have actually found a new place for prime rib!,0
1286,1286,"Great food, great service!  The filet mignon ï¿¼was on point. Caesar salad was great.",0
1287,1287,I've eaten here many times and it never fails to impress. The food and service were incredible.,1
1288,1288,"Having first going to Dal Rae as a 21-year-old it was a joy to return to the states from Australia at 70 and find this gem still flourishing with the most Splendidly efficient helpful waitstaff and managers to begin an exceptionally delicious meal and wines in an enveloping ambience, full tables everywhere and a buzz of conversation that never was intrusive. My husband loved the Deceptively unobtrusive lighting to see what he was eating but it didnât feel highly illuminated. Fantastic!!! Going Again tomorrow",0
1289,1289,Fun dinner. Enjoyed the restaurant. Great menu and very good service,1
1290,1290,"Another exceptionally special evening at the Dal Rae. From the bar to the table, service is excellent. Tableside Caesar is not to be missed. The relish dish is by request these days which is absolutely fine - still a nice way to start the meal. If you order the Caesar, skip the bread service because the cheese bread that is served with the salad is so good! Two at our table had the 10 oz prime rib which looked amazing, one had the veal osso buco - a beautiful presentation with a marrow spoon included! I had the Chilean Sea Bass a la Ben. How I wish I could make that at home - I would eat it daily. The thing I like the best is that the Dal Rae is consistently a wonderful experience - we save it for our special occasions and they always deliver. Note - do not skip the butter cake! It is new to the menu in the last two years. The four of us shared it and collectively agreed that it could possibly be the best dessert ever. Also note - when you have three wine drinkers with different tastes, it is nice to be able to order good quality wines by the glass from in and out of California. I've been coming to the Dal Rae since I was a kid and the fact that it is consistently an amazing meal means a great deal to me.",0
1291,1291,Delicious! This place is a perfect place to celebrate something or someone special. We will definitely be going back. I recommend the sea bass.,1

1295,1295,Order the surf and turf or Top Two. You will not be disappointed. Their level of service is back up! Great dinner.,0
1296,1296,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. However, in order to maximize profits, they have crowded the dining room with more tables. The wait staff couldnât get by, even spilling my drink on one pass. The Thursday pianist is on vacation. Her replacement is a guitarist with music so loud, one cannot have a conversation in the bar.",0
1297,1297,"Dal Rae has always been our family's favorite restaurant to dine, celebrate special occasions and has never disappointed us.",1

Very interesting savory (and tasty) baked brie, the crab cake was quite large and actual crab (rather than fillers).  For our entrees, we had salmon, swordfish steak, and lamb chop, all came with just the right amount of sides.

1407,1407,"This was our first experience at the Dal Rae. We live in Orange County but had heard about this restaurant many years ago when I lived in Downey. I misunderstood the name to be Del Ray and thought it was Mexican food (which I love)

What a surprise to read the menu on line! Steaks, Seafood, Duck, etc and all looked great. Very classic old school entrees with that old Hollywood flair in decor and service.

When we arrived we were met by the very courteous Valet staff.

Seated as we entered. The were no reservations available except for 4:30 on a Saturday night but we took it. So glad that we did it was a great experience.",0
1408,1408,This place has been on my list for a few years now and I'm glad I finally went.

Now it's in my rotation of places to go eat.,0

With its mid century modern setting, old school atmosphere, and staff. Not to mention the food. Table side Caesar, oysters Rockefeller (to die for) topped off with seared ahi, sea bass and lobster tail that literally melted in our mouths. The worst part of the evening was giving up beef for lent. Canât wait to go back for the prime rib and filet mignon. Our meal was ended with crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e all brought to us by Brenden who ensured we were treated to the best experience. I can only add that this place is worth the drive and a shocking surprise in the city of Pico Rivera. Thank you Brenden you made sure this will be our new celebratory restaurant.",0

Everybody knows what they are doing, especially the kitchen staff who prepare consistent, exquisite meals that never disappoint.  The servers are the best I've encountered anywhere in the L.A. area.  Add to the fine food, menu selection and wonderful service, the fact that the ambiance is elegant, refined and has perfect lighting for a romantic dinner setting.  One of the last of it's kind in greater Los Angeles, this dining establishment checks off everything on my list of what I want in a place to take out clients or loved ones for a delightful fine dining experience.  Cocktails were great. The BEST Martinis!  The wine list is comprehensive and sure to have your favorite vintages and varietals.   I had escargot for an appetizer, filet mignon with bernaise for my entree, and unlike other steakhouses, it was not ala carte.  It actually comes with a vegetable and many potato choices as well as rice pilaf.  I've never had better mashed potatoes with perfect seasoning and butter built-in than that provided by the Dal Rae.  Even better than granny's.  Can we talk dessert?  Try the Gold Brick Sundae.   Cheers to your next fine dining experience.  Make it the Dal Rae",0

I hadnât been to Dal Rae in a very long time and it didnât disappoint although the restaurant and valet parking were surprisingly busy and crowded for Thursday lunch.  Nonetheless, I had been able to make a 1 pm reservation just the night before, and we only waited about 15 minutes after our rsvp time.  The hostess said our wait was a bit longer because we had requested a booth.  The holiday lights were still on, lending a very festive and magical air to the dining room, while the booth seating, service and food were excellent but also comfortably relaxed.  We thoroughly enjoyed our leisurely lunch of French dip (very tender and juicy) and seafood salad which we split.  I will definitely keep Dal Rae in mind for other special occasions!",0

1515,1515,"Absolutely fabulous evening from beginning to end. This was not our first time here, so it was like returning home. The entire restaurant had a festive happy vibe and we had the perfect seat to watch it all. Several mangers continued to stop by our table and it reinforced the level of care and service we have always received. 

The first thing we noticed was that guests who had requested outdoor seating were being taken through main dining room. We asked and discovered that an additional patio area was added as result of COVID. 

Of note would be the Christmas menu. In past when we dined on holiday, the menu was scaled down, sort of greatest dishes.  We were very happy to see more choices and it gave us opportunity to try something new - including a scrumptious desert! 

We quite enjoyed live music. It began with Pink Panther, and slowly progressed to AWB and John Lennon among other classic rock tunes.

Dining consisted of Crab stuffed mushrooms, Lobster Thermidor and medallion steak, followed by coffee and Lemon Flute. 

On this busy night, we did not feel rushed to finish our meal. Our server was friendly and didn't rush is either. She shared fantastic story about opening bottle of champagne and how cork almost hit one of antique ceiling lights...

As we enjoy this restaurant, there is no doubt we will return here. They are a testament to classic fine dining experience that my husband and I enjoy: great food, excellent service and ambience!!",1

Instead, I told the hostess my mane and that I had 7:00 reservations for four.  We were early (6:45) so we were amazed when we were seated immediately.  When I ordered diner I asked for Osso Bucco.  I always seem to order it but the waitress notified me that it was not on the menu but if didn't mind a little wait the chef would make it for me. Not only did the chef make it, but it came with the other meals and it was one of the best Osso Bucco I have had at the Dal Rae. Needless today, our dining experience was wonderful.",0

We had a 7 pm reservation but arrived at 6:30 due to the lack of traffic. We were prepared to wait since the restaurant was busy but the hostess offered us a wonderful table.  The restaurant is festively yet elegantly decorated for the holidays.  We are not huge steak people, but we all enjoyed our steaks. They were among the best in LA, and very reasonably priced.  You get more value for price here than you do at the overpriced steak chains that don't include a side or even bread.

For the Dine LA menu, I had the calamari, pepper filet and cheesecake.  ALL were excellent.  The calamari might have been one of the best I have ever had.  The pepper steak was real yummy, but beware if you don't like green onions because there are a lot.  The cheesecake was real good except I was so full I only took a few bites and brought it home.

The ambience is like an old school fine dining steak house.  It's dim and lots of people moving around.  It is on the louder side, but I expected that.  The bar side had live music which was nice.

I look forward to coming back again and trying different things on their menu.",0

I had the Dine LA menu Parmesan Crusted Sea Bass which is always a favorite of mine and it did not disappoint.  He had a delicious prime rib with a side of shrimp scampi that was also delicious.  We learned that if you want the relish tray that you have to ask - so we did and we enjoyed it.  
Only issue we had was that our server disappeared for quite a while from the floor - really no sight of him anywhere for what seemed an eternity.  We wanted plates cleared, more water, another beer etc and he was just gone.  We got what we needed from other staff but it was strange how he was no where to be seen.",0

They make things you don't see much of these days, such as tableside Ceaser Salad, Lobster Thermidor, a relish tray and chateaubriand for 2! Its been there since the late 1950s and is a welcome throwback to simpler times when it was such a pleasure to dine out and enjoy a fine, traditional meal! (My personal favorite is the bone-in, broiled veal chop with morel mushroom sauce.) The service can't be bear, with many of the staff being there for 20 years! One of the two owner-brothers is always on site. We saw Loren last night.

And at Christmas time their holiday decorations are unparalleled!

Respectful, knowledgeable staff.  My friend and I started off with Vodka Martiniâs and had an unrushed conversation before we even opened the menus.  We ordered an appetizer of escargot (the best!)  and later decided to split a meal which included a delicious salad of baby mixed greens with baked goat cheese and an exquisite raspberry vinaigrette including whole raspberries, then Dal Raeâs famous Pepper Steak filet mignon served with asparagus and tasty mashed potatoes for me and a lovely baked potato for my friend.  They have a great wine list and we found that the 2017 Rodney Strong Alexander Valley Reserve Cabernet hit the mark.  For dessert, apple tart with vanilla ice cream & coffee.  I am so thankful that the Dal Rae continues serving its customers a consistent, elegant dining experience in a world that seems to be increasingly less consistent and elegant.  5 Stars isnât enough",0

1726,1726,"Phenomenal!  We started with Escargot (garlic butter heaven!). 
 The Prime Rib and Sea Bass are the two best sellers, so we opted for them and were not disappointed.   The Prime Rib was juicy and tender - you could cut it with a fork!  The Sea Bass was perfection - flaked at the touch of a fork, and just about melted in your mouth.  Juicy, flavorful and just a hint of lemon butter. 

Desserts of Tira Misu and the Dal Rae Butter Cake had to be taken home, as we didn't have room to eat it there.  I have only 3 words to say about the desserts:  Butter. Cake. Yum!

This is a classic steakhouse,  of which there are, sadly, few remaining.  We were celebrating our anniversary and wanted something special, and we got it!",0

But one bite and it was like I never left. Ambiance is a very old school Vegas steakhouse vibe. Live band, amazing bar, outstanding service. Comfort and style from beginning to end. 
Classy joint for classy people with the best food I have ever eaten. Tonight was no exception. Crab cakes are delicious. Caesar salad is still something special even though thereâs no more table side prep (likely due to Covid). 
Steaks, lobsters are fall apart, melt in your mouth decadence. Side dishes hold their own and are full of flavor. TRY THE TOMATOES! They will change your life, man! 
The service I cannot say enough about. Even those that arenât servicing your table are extremely generous with their time & cordial to you as if you were royalty. 
All in all, a perfect 10 as a dining experience. I promise I will be back!",0

1828,1828,"Food was delicious!! Hands down the best steak Iâve had. The waitress gave us excellent wine recommendations for our taste. The only thing, and obviously I will not hold it against them, is that now that they have an outdoor patio the usually dim romantic ambiance was interrupted every few minutes by the door to the outdoor patio opening and closing.

A great way to celebrate being back at the Dal Rea.â¨â¨We started off with the chopped salad, (Crisp Bacon, Peeled Tomato, Avocado, Turkey, Onion, Egg, Grated Bleu Cheese & Marinara Dressing). We asked to split the salad as it is quite large (EntrÃ©e size) and big enough to split.â¨â¨They delivered a breadbasket that was plentiful w/ delicious sourdough bread & spicy cracker bread.  It went perfectly with the chopped salad.â¨â¨For my entrÃ©e I had the poor man's pepper steak. It is a ground angus beef patty smothered in green onions and bacon, omg so good!â¨It came with their extra creamy mashed potatoes (very similar to Robuchon mashed potatoes) that looked like clouds and they taste amazing light airy and smooth. It also had roasted asparagus on the side, which I gave to my wife, it is her favorite.â¨â¨My wife had the Chicken piccata it looked delicious. It came with the mashed potatoes and my wifeâs asked for the zucchini sautÃ©ed rather than prepared fried Dore style. My wife said it was excellent. â¨â¨From the valet to our server (Dawn) the service was exceptional as was the food , I would definitely recommend it.â¨â¨Thanks Kevin and Lorin for keeping the tradition for all these years at such a high standard",0

2103,2103,"Once again a great meal at Dal Rae, great food, great service, pretty good value for the money(2 of us, it was $175 and we split salad and desert, with 3 drinks).  Our waitress was Racquel and she was fantastic.  Only negative is we waited for about 15 minutes for someone to initially greet us at table, other people were seated after us and were asked for drink orders and were given bread.  Also, the garlic bread was given to us about 15 minutes after we were given bread.  I wish she would have told us garlic bread was being served and I would have not eaten the regular bread.  Those are relatively minor complaints, as the Prime Rib and Lamb Chops were superb, as well as the Iceberg lettuce, Baked Potato and Creme Brule.  Have been going to Dal Rae for 50 years and have always enjoyed atmosphere, food and service.",0

2167,2167,"We had our office Christmas party here and it was awesome. Everything about the place was great. Ambiance, staff, appetizers, everything. Two downsides. Due to their being two parties outside they left a side door open that was some what an issue as a table behind us complained and I also asked if they could close the door which they couldnât. Lastly and most unfortunate was that my filet was not a center cut or anything close. We all ordered the dinner filets and mine was about a 1/3 of the size and was not tender or melted in your mouth. I wouldnât of come back if it wasnât for me trying the person next to me steak. Thereâs was amazing.

We explained to her that we wanted to enjoy a cocktail before we ordered and she was very accommodating. She checked with us to make sure everything was OK and when weâre ready to order she was very accommodating with questions about the menu. During our meal Angie checked in on us to make sure we were OK and she opened a bottle of wine for us that was 24 years old and the cork had disintegrated. Without a beat Angie got a carafe and  was able to save the wine. Angie also brought out a special dessert for our anniversary.

Our server seemed a little pushy but, he was young and probably does not have the experience of the other servers weâve had in the past. Thatâs the only reason I gave the service 4 stars instead of 5. He was still courteous and friendly but lacks the intuition. Experienced servers donât interrupt a table while enjoying a starter to take your entree order. Dal Rae isnât a quick in and out kind of place. You enjoy the time you spend there.",0

Dal Rae became a reward to myself after cancer appointments, your food gave me something to be grateful for, seriously.  Rose was our server yesterday, she was FANTASTIC. The food was, as always, THE BEST. The lunch atmosphere was everything I expected, first class all the way. The service was unexcelled.

If youâve never been to Dal Rae, you need to step back in time and enjoy your âRat-Packâ exciting dinner with a 1950âs era feel and have a wonderful time!  Youâll be glad you did!

PS: to the classy manager greeting guests at reservations, thanks for your polite patience as I unloaded my irritation over LA Countyâs latest unconstitutional overreach where youâre forced to show your vaccine card to be able to dine. More wokeness punishing the Awake Americans who actually work and pay taxes. Your friendly understanding and warm reception was sincerely appreciated!

2234,2234,"The ""Dal"" is a step back into time, to a restaurant that is really a restaurant. People come to enjoy the cuisine, the energy, the great service, and for me and my friend, the lovely and most talented Dianne Gire at the keyboards on Thursday evenings only, in the lounge. The long drive on a Thursday evening from anywhere in the city is what I consider a ""field trip"" to a journey worth enjoying. I have loved this place for years, and will continue to love it.",1

2339,2339,"I took my beautiful wife to the Dal Rae last night. There are no pictures because we decided to just be in the moment like the old days. It was our first time there and we have to say that it was every bit as good as everybody says. Food was excellent. Service was great. I will just give one warning for those who have never been there. Donât eat the food they bring out at first. Itâs a trap! I still canât figure out their desired end result, but there are definitely some diabolical machinations going on. They continue with the cheese bread but that part is worth it. Just ask them to only bring out two pieces and hold them to it (like that scene in Young Frankenstein). I will start saving my shekels for another visit, but we will go in much wiser next time (and properly trained and prepared). I skipped lunch to enjoy the dinner and went it too hungry. Lesson learned. At least I was wise enough to avoid the appetizers (which all sounded amazing).",1

2369,2369,"Our meal was top notch and our server was great, as usual. We did notice that the restaurant seemed to be running behind and, as a result, it took longer than usual for each course to come out. Our server was working so hard to keep up, we could tell the service time was out of her control and she apologized several times for the delays. There was a large party seated around our table that made the space feel more crowded than usual.",0
2370,2370,"Took my wife out for her Birthday on 8/17. Our server Val was very helpful and assisted us on the various cuts of meat. I am not much of a meat connoisseur and usually order seafood.

Then moved in for dinner.  Had the pesto and Brie appetizer and it was excellent!  Iâm trying new items each visit and had the halibut and it was so delicious!  Friends had the filet (which was huge) and the famous sea bass that Dal Rae is known for!  Both were very happy with everything!  Also had beautiful dessert and they had to roll us out of there!

Lily was attentive but not obtrusive.  Seafood and prime rib were good, too much sauce on the fish and while they gave us a bigger piece of prime rib, prefer leaner, smaller portion without the bone.  The wait staff made us feel very important, thank you!",0

2390,2390,"Excellent food service and decor.  It has always been one of my two favorite restaurants for 30 years when the twins were running it.  I havenât been able to get there for about 7 years and I felt the same sense of history and decor  fresh but unchanged.  Perfect service and food.  Change in the lighting of the outside sign was a sad part of history lost. I was surprised to see the bar area changed into a hot spot.  Very loud but didnât bother me in regular restaurant while eating.  Itâs different in the bar but it was quite wonderful to see people enjoy themselves so much.  The only comment I have is that the bar was packed with people like sardines dancing with no masks on,  I am vaccinated but with delta I still have COVID fear.  I have no idea if the people in the bar in such a large group close together with no masks not knowing if vaccinated or not and with the delta scare was a good idea,  it was scary especially when I went to the restroom and forgot to wear my mask and had to walk through them.",1

My husband and I had the tomahawk steak while  our other two guests had the ribeye steak and the pepper steak. We had mashed Potatoes as a side, creamy corn, and baked potato. Our appetizers included a Caesar salad and an iceberg wedge salad and also Calamari. Bread was served once we were seated, and cheese bread was served once we received our entrÃ©es. Everything was great.

The servers were very attentive.

I feel this place is perfect for anyone going on a first date because of the ambience. 

Our party of four enjoyed this place.

However, the Parking valet was horrible - upon arrival, the parking attendant was extremely rude, setting the tone early on - fortunately, I was in great company and was able to shake the experience off - the attendant was opening my door and practically forcing me out of the car!

We were very fortunate to have Jennifer as our server. She is the best!
We started off with drinks & ahi on toast with avocado. It was absolutely delicious!
With COVID, things at high end restaurants are done differently. Jenniferâs service was so perfect, that one didnât notice the difference.

Our server was welcoming, professional, efficient and she was very attentive. The Chilean Sea Bass has never failed us and we always look forward to going to Dal Rae. They have valet parking and the attendants are also very accommodating, professional and friendly. The reason for my 4 star is although our food was amazing, it was a bit cold.

We asked if we could wait for an in door table and in a very serious expression said no. I did not bring a sweater because I was looking forward to eating in doors.

Do, having gotten our vaccines and waited the required time for max immunity, we made a reservation at Dal Rae's.  Unbeknownst to us, there is now a rustic addition to the eating area and we got seated out there.  I told the waiter that it was our 50th and he made magic happened.  They brought in an extra small table and set it just 6 feet away from everyone and we had a lovely dinner in the ambiance of the original dining area.

The server (Eileen) went out of her way to make our experience a pleasant and memorable one. Abalone is a special at the restaurant, and my dining companion (sister-in-law) ordered it, and said ""It is out of this world!"" It was rather expensive as abalone is not in abundance! But, we indulged! I had the double cut pork chop with whiskey rosemary sauce and they accommodated my request to put everything rosemary on the side.

I remember them getting dressed up for New Year's or a special occasion and going to the Dal Rae. I took my Mother there for her 99th birthday this last Friday,  despite her end stage Alzheimers, she knew where she was when she tasted her favorite Vodka Gimlet. This is a fine dining establishment that serves the best continental cuisine. There are very few places like this anymore. I hope I can take my mom for her 100th. You can bet in-between I will visit at least 5-6 times.  I live in Southern Orange County and I am not limited by taste or budget, I pass a lot of places to eat here because it is truly the best.",0

2747,2747,This has got to be one of our all time favorite restaurants.  Their Chilean sea bass is magnificent and so is their pepper corn steak.  Due to Covid they now have a wonderful outdoor covered patio which is beautiful and inviting.  I highly recommend.,0

2749,2749,"We were seated right away. The service and food are always great!  Iâm taking into account, that because of covid, Dal Raeâs dress code wasnât being enforced. Kids in sweats.

2753,2753,As always the food was fantastic and the service was excellent! There are not too many places left where the owner will walk the floor and make you feel like an old friend but Lorin always takes the time to make his rounds.

2756,2756,"Dal Rae never disappoints.  We enjoy celebrating special occasions here, whether itâs a birthday or anniversary.  This time we took advantage of the DineLA menu.  The menu offered an enticing selection for each course.  I usually order the prime rib, but I went with the filet mignon and it was perfectly cooked and the pepper sauce was delectable.  My boyfriend was went with his favorite Chilean sea bass entree which was cooked to perfection.  The service was excellent and we were extremely satisfied with the quality and freshness of our meal.   We were seated in the outdoor patio dining area which had a beautiful wall fountain.  The ambiance made for a romantic dining experience.",0

Feels like you have stepped back in time! :)",0

I was able to take my filet home for later, the portions were very generous. We even ordered calamary which was super fresh and we shared a Caesar salad for two. I really enjoyed the bread-and-butter and the garlic bread they brought before our food. The ambience was amazing considering the corona virus. I highly recommend this as a date night for anybody. The meat quality was superb and not one ounce of nasty fat anywhere, it was premium beef and cut smooth like butter. I also ordered tirimisu  and that was heavily soaked in alcohol. My boyfriend ordered a paloma and I ordered a mojito; both had a lot of alcohol in them. I highly recommend this classic steak house.",0

2804,2804,"First time dining here since the COVID-19 restrictions. Very nice set up, on a covered patio with plenty of air flowing in and air conditioning. It was about 90 degrees outside when we went but very comfortable in the outdoor dining area. 

Only difference from prior dining experiences was it took over an hour to bring our food--however the wait staff were apologizing for it saying it was due to a great number of take out orders. Wasn't a problem for us, so if you don't mind waiting, it's great.

Service and food was spectacular as always. This was a wonderful break from our ""no going out for dinner"" routine. If conditions regarding COVID remain the same for awhile, we're planning on making dining out at Del Rae a regular experience.",0

Limited menu with plenty of great choices. I do miss my poor boy steak however. 
But you will never go wrong with their pepper steaks.
Had the ceaser salad for 2 which we get each time we dine there, love it.
The salad wasn't made tableside but had no effect on how great it was.

2828,2828,"Dal Rae never disappoints, especially if you are looking for a ""fancy"" restaurant but you don't want to spend a ton.   Usually around $50-$75 a person, but you could spend a lot more at another steakhouse and the food is not even as good.   If you have never been, you must try once!  I go a few times a year!",1

2839,2839,"The food as always was exceptional. The restaurant has implemented cleaning standards that I can only describe as above a beyond what they are required to do. I especially liked the face shield worn by the assistants who wore them. Waitress was friendly and personable. Sevice was outstanding.

The Chilean sea Bass was cooked to perfection and my wife's prime rib was almost as good as Lawry's (which specializes in prime rib).

Overall it was worth the 350 mile trip i make every year to celebrate my birthday at this establishment.",0

We tried the wedge and the hearts of romaine and they were both exceptional. 
I also enjoyed the grilled artichoke, and flourless chocolate cake. Their signature pepper steak was a little disappointing. It was very thoughtful of  our server to bring us a cheesecake on the house for the occasion that we were celebrating.

What a super nice touch to begin the evening.  We were warmly greeted by Ruben who took time to ask how our day was. He was very personable and paid attention to every detail throughout our dinner.  Ruben is a wonderful asset to the Dal Rae restaurant. We were at the restaurant about a month and a half ago and were talking to a Buser whose name is Axel. He recognized us and drop by to see if there was anything we needed at our table. We thought that was so  Nice to be acknowledged. As our  evening progressed we could see  Axel working many tables throughout the restaurant with ease. He seems like a very professional young man and also an asset to the Dal Rae.  We  just love the Dal Rae restraunt.  People like Ruben , Axel and the young lady at the hostess desk made our evening even more special thank you very much !",0

The wait was more than we would have liked as we werenât seated until 8.30 for a 8 pm reservation but we understand they donât have much control over people hanging around after dinner.But the food and value made up for the wait. We both ordered their famous Pepper steak fillet and it was just out of this world. I have been dining at Dal Rae for over 40 years and have never been disappointed with their Pepper steak. The appetizers and their signature Gold brick Sundae as well as the garlic mash were just outstanding. Another great meal at Dal Rae, thanks!!",0

2931,2931,"Our server gave us awesome service.
The food was good , however because of the holiday, our caesar salad was pre-made ( not tableside), so it suffered in the transition. My salmon was tasty, asparagus okay. 
I have been coming here for many years, so the differences were apparent to us. 
At the end of the day, Del Rae is still an amazing restaurant to have dinner, or celebrate an occasion/event!

I would  have preferred  more dill and lemon  juice- keep it  simple and healthier. Cocktail  for $17 seems  exorbitant,way  overpriced. Loved  those  flat bread pieces.",0

2992,2992,Always a great experience to dine at the Dal Rae. Everyone gets treated like theyâre special from the moment you pull in the driveway to the moment you get in your car to leave and thatâs because every guest is special to everyone at the Dal Rae; itâs not the kind of thing that can be faked.

3002,3002,"I hadn't been to Dal Rae in many years, but I read a review in the LA Times that took me to Pico Rivera. I decided my daughter needed to see how it was done in the days of my misspent youth, so we went for a Saturday dinner of table-side delights. Is Dal Rae the last restaurant in Los Angeles to start you out with a cut glass oblong bowl filled with crushed ice, raw veggies, pickles and peppers? We proceeded to the Caesar salad for two, prepared on a rolling cart next to our table. Not shy on the garlic, the dressing was delicious and the lettuce was crisp and fresh. Our next course was steak Diane, also prepared table-side, with Bordelaise sauce augmented with (yes) garlic, butter, other seasonings and some flaming brandy. The steaks were very good and the sauce was delicious. The dish included whole mushrooms, asparagus (nicely cooked) and (for me) a baked potato. We saw Bananas Foster prepared at another table, and were tempted by a flaming dessert, but ended up with the chocolate souffle, which was served with a delicious hot fudge sauce and unsweetened whipped cream. Our table-side chef was funny and knew his way around a rolling table. The other servers were also helpful, and the service overall was excellent.",0
3003,3003,"Good food. Great service. Good restaurant to take a date, wife or other.  It's expensive",1
3004,3004,"An old time steakhouse that has kept the charm but has kept up with the right changes. They continue to serve the best steaks and seafood; and did I say ""pepper steak"". Where can you still go and have a nice round booth; the Dal Rae. How about a Caesar salad made at your table. If you are looking for a fine dining establishment with the freshest and top quality food then go no further. The service is impeccable as well. You won't be disappointed!",0

Weâve now brought several couples for an amazing dining experience.",1

3008,3008,"Date night with the love of my life. We are having a tough week with work and life. Our waitress asked how we were and I said terrible, she said â We are going to change that!â She did. We had great drinks and eats. A perfect Martini. The relish dish is a classic at the Dal Rae. The cheese bread has not changed since last century, seriously. I had not had Prime Rib for a while I am not sure why. Perfectly medium rare. Tomato slices with blue cheese yum yum yum! They changed my day from a â1â to a â10â",0

I had the halibut and it was excellent. Lydia was our server and she was excellent, friendly, accommodating. We loved the tableside caesar salad prep.",0
3037,3037,"It was just a little crowded and crammed. We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and we had waiters bending over/prepping food next to us in the middle tables which was a little uncomfortable, not very personal or private which was what we were looking for. Other than that the food as always was great, and the service was amazing.",1

3042,3042,Service is exceptional as is the food. Caesar salad prepared table side is tasty.,0
3043,3043,"As always, the food and service at Dal Rae were excellent.  Our waiter, John, was most attentive and provided superb service and food suggestions. We noticed that the prices at Dal Rae have increased substantially and found our meals to be very, very expensive, although the quality of the food was great. More importantly to me, there was no soap in the ladies room and, therefore, neither I nor the servicers who used that restroom could wash our hands properly!! That thought disgusted me and I reported the soap issue to the front desk and although they said they would take care of it, I noticed they weren't rushing to do that!!",0
3044,3044,"It's often difficult to make our entire family happy, but Dal Rae exceeded! Crab claw appetizer, the claws were HUGE, fresh and delicious. Every meal for our party of 6 was done to perfection. Wilted spinach salad prepared table side was fresh and tantalizing. The desserts...well you just cannot go wrong with any but the #1 winner is Grand Marnier Supreme also prepared tableside. Service is top notch. One note of caution, wear stretch pants.",0

3046,3046,"Kevinâs team is first rate and all class. Kevin (one of the owners) or another of the family are always there overlooking the service and food quality. Have Barry (who also tends bar on the nights he is not on duty in the dining room) make a table-side salad for you. The only restaurant left that I know of with true table-side service (salads and flaming entrees and deserts), caviar and abalone. The bar and lounge is old school and welcoming. Iâve been a customer since â71 and keep going back.",0

It's something special that you don't really see any more at restaurants.",0

for the last 25 years I have gone there. There is nobody in the LA area that does abalone like Dal Rae. Try it with the caper sauce. Mmmmmm! The friendly staff makes you feel VERY welcome there.",1
3051,3051,I went to celebrate my 30th Birthday with my friends this place is very elegant food is delious and service is amazing ð,1

3056,3056,We had a really nice night there. We will definitely be back again but with friends. ð¥°,1
3057,3057,"We try to make it a point to go to the Dal Rae at least once or twice a year. We go for both the food-- which never fails to be exceptional-- and the ambience-- which has kind of a 60s Vegas steakhouse vibe. I always imagine that you could see Sammy Davis or Dean Martin sitting at the bar on any given night. The Caesar salad, prepared table side, is probably the best salad I have ever eaten in my life. And what a treat it is to watch how it all comes together! My wife had the petite filet with mashed potatoes, and I had the large filet with a baked potato. For something different, I opted for the pepper sauce. While not bad, I decided that I much prefer to savor the unaugmented flavor of well grilled beef. Your tastes may differ. I won't be ordering this sauce again, but it was a nice change. The meat was so tender it could, to use a well worn cliche', melt in your mouth, with a beautiful sear and a consequent flavor one can only find in a well broiled piece of beef. For dessert, we opted for souffles-- order them at the start of the meal because they take time to prepare-- chocolate for me and Grand Marnier for my wife. They come with a sauce on the side (not surprisingly, chocolate and Grand Marnier, respectively) and a healthy dollop of whipped cream. Service was top notch, with never a wait for drink refills, nor even a need to ask for them. We left pleasantly stuffed and VERY happy! All in all, another 5 star experience!",0
3058,3058,Date night with the wife!,1
3059,3059,"Food was spot on. Everything we had was excellent.   We had the seafood tower, Sea Bass and bone in filet. Desert was great also. Service was also exceptional",0
3060,3060,"I have been coming to Dal Rae for decades and it never fails to impress.  The food is always top quality and they can usually adjust an item to your needs. Our server was wonderful--Friendly, attentive and efficient. The only criticism this visit was the noise level.  It was difficult to hear people at our table.

This is probably the best overall restaurant in the San Gabriel Valley area.",0

3064,3064,I love going to Dal Raes. They have the nicest people that work there. Our server was so nice and so observant an attentive. The food is always delicious and cook perfectly to our liking. The managers stop by at each table to greet their guests and they chat with you.,1
3065,3065,"Another great experience at a great restaurant.  The service level was a little less than normal. The dining area was not full on this past Sat. night.  I could see that the server had a lot of tables to keep happy. With the number of tables and the server having to dash out to the bar, she was really earning her pay Sat. evening. Our server was very good and I hope she feels we rewarded her for all her hard work.        The food was normal------great! We brought an out of town guest because it was her birthday. Dal Rae graciously  brought her a treat. Dal Rae is a great place and has been for many, many years-----THANK YOU!",0
3066,3066,Friends birthday,1
3067,3067,The Dal Rae is as good or better as it was in the mid 1960âs.  My parents brought me here for a special occasion and the tradition in our family continues to thus day. Our boys and their families love it as much as we do.  You can always count on the best of everything when it comes to the food and the service.  Not many restaurants still have table side preparations for salads and certain meats. I can only hope that things donât change at the Dal Rae.,0
3068,3068,"Food and service were outstanding.  It was very crowded on Thursday night which surprised me.  It felt more like a Saturday night.  Portions are quite generous, so even though items are on the pricey side, I got to take home leftovers which always is a plus.",0

3130,3130,"Iâve been here several times.  Dal Rae never disappoints.  The servers are all excellent, and the bar makes great drinks.  I ordered the âpetiteâ cut prime rib with mashed potatoes last night...it was HUGE! AND DELICIOUS! and I could only eat half of it before it put me into a food coma. 
     Itâs as old school traditional as a restaurant can get, but thatâs its unique vintage charm.  Think circa 1959 dark leather booths, real linens, live piano music, Caesar salad made from scratch right before your eyes, and cherries jubilee flambÃ©d at tableside.
     Itâs an expensive night out, so be prepared for that.  If âoldâ isnât your thing and you want avant-garde molecular gastronomy, you should find another place to go.",0

We were both disappointed with the ambiance and the steaks were both extremely undercooked (not how we ordered).  It was a shame we had a negative experience for $250.00.  I found the Dal Rae and we read great reviews.  We tried it Friday before Mother's Day.  Our table was ready when we arrived, despite being crowded.  The service was great.  Little things like water refills, bread, cleaning plates off when needed, etc.  The food was amazing.  Sourdough bread and butter, relish tray, fire roasted artichoke, ceasar salads to start.  I had the parmesan crusted Chilean sea bass with garlic mashed potatoes.  It was perfect and a good sized portion.  My wife had the peppered filet mignon.  Outstanding flavor, good size portion and you could cut it with a fork. Cheesecake for dessert with fresh berries.  Best meal I have ever had and a new favorite spot.  Cheaper than the high end chain we went to and much better.",0

They went above and beyond and I would definitely go back for another special occasion.,0
3194,3194,"Again, another great dining experience at the Dal Rae. The table side prepared Cesar salad is phenomenal, the New York strip prepared medium well was juicy, tender and full of flavor and the Rigatoni Romano is a hidden gem on their menu. The service was spot on as usual and one of the owners even stopped by the table to ask how our dinner was. Low light ambiance and an old school 1960âs vibe make for a unique dining experience.

The portions here are generous so pace yourself if you want dessert! Enjoyed Thanksgiving dinner and my husband's 60th birthday most recently, and was pleased with fixed menu on Thanksgiving and lunch choices.

3258,3258,"Dear Kevin and Loren, You may not remember Karen and Peter Masters from San Diego. We had not been to the Dal Rae for over two years so we were really looking forward to dining there again. When we arrived Marcie greeted us with "" There are the Masters. We have missed for such a long time. I am so glad to see you both again. I do have your favorite server Mary Jane taking care of you tonight"". Wow! We were blown away by Marcie's reception and her remembering how much we liked having Mary Jane as our server. 

When Mary Jane came to our table she gave us such a warm welcome and then said "" I bet you both would like Stoli's on the rocks and in a bucket?""  We congratulated her on her great memory and agreed that was our drink of choice. When they came they did not only have two olives in each but the pick also had an onion attached which only made the cocktail taste better.

After we ordered our second drink we were ready to order our dinner. Mary Jane came back and I ask if we could order now. She said of course and I thank that each of you would like the Filet Medium rare with pepper sauce and a baked potato and cheese sauce but, I think that you would like to share a wilted spinach salad first. Well, again we thanked her for her great memory and then went about enjoying our relish tray. (It was not as we remember it because it had fewer vegetables but it was good).
 
After our wonderful spinach salad our main course arrived with all the trimmings. It looked wonderful and the pepper sauce smelled so good we dove right into the steak. After a few bits we looked at each other and said ""This is not the same type of filet that we had when we were here last time."" It was the same size as before but it was not nearly as tender as the ones we have had in the past when we could almost cut the steak with our fork. This time we had to work it with our knifes. 

We did not mention our disappointed to Mary Jane because she did such a good job taking care of us. Peter",0
3259,3259,"Service and food, entire dining experience at 100%.

Thank you, Dal Rae!",1

3265,3265,"The Dal Rae was recommended to us by a friend, so we went there for our 33 anniversary. Their signature New York steak with toppings(peppercorns, green onion, and bacon) was cooked perfectly and just exceptional. For dessert, we shared a souffle, which we had never had before. It too, was just wonderful. The atmosphere is a little dark, but leans toward the romantic side. However, at our age, we needed our reading glasses and a flashlight in order to see the menu, lol. We would like to return someday, but on our budget, it's only a SPECIAL occasion type of place.",1

We had another server as well but I can't remember her name...only that she had a flower in her hair:)  My aunt and uncle and  their friends, in addition to my parents, always used to go to Dal Rae so it was quite special to be able to go and recall all the old memories.

3273,3273,"The Dal Rae is  an amazing restaurant - where you can see a couple dressed to the nines, sipping champagne at one table, and see a table for four, with everyone wearing sweatpants and t-shirts, and receiving the same great service.

3352,3352,Amazing food and service. Really shouldâve brought my wife there much sooner. Was a bit noisy but was New Yearâs Eve so canât knock them for that. Iâm so glad I was able to get a reservation for NYE. Wife is a tough critic and she had nothing negative to say. A+!,1
3353,3353,"We have been coming to Dal Rae for many years and it is still one of my favorite places. It feels like you've taken a time machine back to the 40s when everything was polished, including the amazing staff. This year we went for New Year's Eve.  It was a limited menu but still worth every bite.  We dined late so that we could ring in the new year in style so a few options had run out (Clam Chowder and Creme Brulee). Not to worry...We all had incredibly delicious back up plans and were not disappointed. The cocktails are old school and definitely not for the amateur cocktail drinker. The best cosmopolitan in the country.  So with every perfect review comes one thing that could be improved. Since it was New Year's Eve and people paid a nice penny for dinner (well worth it) I would have expected a small glass of bubbly to ring in the new year. They did pass out hats and noisemakers but every place I've ever been to on New Year's Eve gives a small glass of champagne or prosecco just for the toast. Surprising but not a deal breaker. Just a minor suggestion from a long time and continued patron who loves Dal Rae! Thanks again for a lovely evening!",0
3354,3354,"Better than Mastros, Ruthâs Chris and the rest of the Beverly Hills fine restaurants.
Problem areas: In the middle of nowhere for those on the Westside and a long ride. A portion of the restaurant is in dire need of an upgrade. We were seated there and asked to be moved. They were nice and moved us. Awesome food, service and reasonable prices for what you get.",0

Very clean but you are in a restaurant you went to in the 70s. There is so much on the menu to select from you might be overwhelmed, but donât be just know everything is good you canât make a bad choice. The wine selection is good and they have good wine at the right price point you donât have to go high to make a good choice. They do desserts the old fashioned way also chocolate soufflÃ© got it cherries jubilee got it Banana flambÃ© yep got that too done at the table so you watch them make your masterpiece.

3498,3498,It's been years since we've been to a nice restaurant like this. We were seated immediately and our relish tray and Bread Basket was delivered immediately. Our server Helga was so delightful and we had the tableside spinach salad which was scrumptious and we had Chateaubriand which was out of this world tableside and then we each picked our desserts which were out of this world as well. I can't say enough about this restaurant it's been a long time since we've come to the restaurant where they wait on you hand and foot.,0

Best restaurant in my book and I do frequent Mastroâs due to closeness of where I live.,1
3505,3505,"The Dal Rae has the ambience of an old-time gents club. Think Musso & Frankâs. It is in the middle of nowhere you would consider for a restaurant. But at lunchtime itâs always packed.  When I walk in,  I always think to myself, âwhere the hell did all these people come from?!â The menu is expansive and the food is always great and generously portioned.  Iâve never been for dinner but lunch is always spot on. Best to have a reservation. Count on valet parking because there is NOWHERE else to put your car.",0

And as usual the service was excellent 
The food was good. This made for an excellent experience. Thank you",1
3517,3517,"Best restaurant within a 10 mile radius. Went with a small group and had the chance to sample a lot from their menu, including their go-to classics and cocktails. Everything was great and we were actually pretty blown away. Add the awesome service, super-duper staff, and mid-century modern charm factor and it makes for a terrific experience. Easy to see why it makes the âBest of LAâ type of lists you see all over the place these days. In fact, I would argue it gets underrated and largely overlooked for geographic reasons. Itâs actually a helluva lot better than some of the more famous classic LA spots in Hollywood or Downtown. Canât wait to go back.",0

Do you remember the old saying, "" You get what you pay for "" Well the Del Rae goes above and beyond that old saying. It's a little pricey, but when you taste the food, feel the comfort, get waited on hand and foot, you won't even think about the price.

3544,3544,The food was amazing! My filet mignon was cooked to perfection! I will go back for sure!,0
3545,3545,I have been coming to the Del Rey restaurant for many years. The overall experience here is always second to none. This is an iconic restaurant within the city of Pico Rivera. This title still holds true after all these years.,1
3546,3546,"Outstanding! Dal Rae is always outstanding! Service, food and ambience make for an enjoyable lunch or dinner. 

This time we were here for dinner. We all went for seafood and all options were delicious. Sea bass, halibut and probably the best salmon ever! Yum!! 

We love this spot and will be back again soon.",0
3547,3547,"I've been so many times I've lost count. We go every Christmas Eve and I usually also make it another 2 or 3 times a year, if I'm lucky. Yes on certain nights (weekends, holidays) it can get insane and even if you have a reservation you may wait, but the bar is wonderful so who cares. The staff, the food, the entire place is worth it. As many have mentioned, the old school aspect - relish trays, many table side presentations if you order such dishes, the booths - is so comforting and special. But the food is really terrific and the staff makes it all worth it. 

I'm a big fan of the classic pepper steak, though the green pepper aspect can throw some people. We love starting with both the calamari and the Oysters Rockefeller, both so good. And the table side caesar is justifiably famous. As is the twist on bananas foster for dessert. But, really, you can't go wrong. The seafood is also wonderful. 

Special mention must go to Marci at the front desk. How she manages the tables in the chaos with such calm grace amazes me. She rocks. And recently Christina gave us some of the best service at the table I've had there, which is saying a lot. 

Great place!",0
3548,3548,"Dal Rae is such a wonderful old-school restaurant, especially for a special occasion. Husband and I enjoyed dinner here on Saturday night (we've been before) and had a wonderful time. The food, with a good variety of options, but we particularly love the ""1950s Continental Cuisine"" menu items that are hard to find anymore. 

In terms of food, husband started with Raw Oysters, while I had the Crab-Stuffed Artichoke Bottoms. For mains, he had Frog Legs and I had Bone-In Filet Mignon with Bearnaise Sauce. We had to order the Tableside Caesar Salad (best I've ever had) and Grand Marnier (amazing). We started with cocktails (Manhattan for me, Vodka Martini for him) and then had enjoyed a celebratory bottle of Veuve Cliquot Brut Rose.  All the food and drink was delicious.

The service was just as wonderful. Our server, Liz, was friendly, helpful, and professional.  When making the reservation on Open Table, we had requested a booth (rather than a table) as it was our anniversary - and we were happy to find ourselves indeed seated at a booth. Valet parking is affordable at only $4-$5 (I don't remember exactly). The only negatives I have are, first, the woman who sits at the front podium. We have been to Dal Rae on multiple occasions over the years, and I have never seen her be friendly. Her attitude always seems to be sullen, as if she is doing you a favor when you check in for your reservation. The second negative is that, when you check in for your reservation, you are given one of those buzzers, the type you find at chain restaurants like PF Changs. I understand that Dal Rae can get really busy on weekend nights, but I don't expect to be given a buzzer at this price point.",0
3549,3549,"Took my wife for her birthday.  Dawn was our waitress. She was Excellent,  Friendly, Helpful. We asked her to explain a couple items. She was Great. Food was Amazing. Loved the Ambience.  A gentleman came by a few times to also check on us. Everything Was Exceptional!!! Alittle Too Dark to read the smaller print on the menus, but that a is small thing and kind of funny.",1

3554,3554,I live in the OC and have been making the drive to the Dal Rae for years. It still is my #1 favorite restaurant!,1
3555,3555,"The Dal Rae is an absolute diamond in the rough.  Driving by, you might not give it a second glance, but inside the ambiance is incredible.  Combine that with the exceptional menu, kind and courteous staff and you have a real winner here.  

The speciality is the Peppercorn Steak and it is amazing.  My favorite is the Lobster Thermador, a true treat.  For starters, I recommend the tableside-created Caesar Salad and/or the Calamari and white sauce.  So tasty I dare you to leave either unfinished.  My family and I ate there again this past Saturday and as usual, we left full and satisfied.  

The prices are not cheap, but you get what you pay for.  For a real treat, try this place out, just not on a Saturday night.  That's when my family and I go and I don't want even greater competition for a table.

The Dal-Rae is a WINNER!",0
3556,3556,"My wife and I went for the first time, for our wedding anniversary. It was really very good. All of the food was fantastic, the service was fantastic.

All in all, I can assure you, this restaurant is a tradition in the family and for very good reasons.",0

One of my favorite appetizers is the Fried Rock Shrimp cooked extra crispy. Itâs kind of like an orange shrimp from the Chinese restaurants but better. 

For salads, you gotta try their Caesar Salad. Made fresh right in front of you. Itâs the best Caesar salad Iâve ever had. 

For my meal I shared a tomahawk steak. Itâs 38 ounces of greatness. Super thick and tender with full of flavor. My business partner loved it. 

For Dessert, a must order is the Banana FlambÃ©. They make the sauce and dessert right in front of you. Itâs incredible. Canât wait to come back again soon!",0

24,3654,"Started out at the bar for Happy Hour.  Our waitress, Sonia, was very attentive and professional.  She made a point to make us feel we were important and she addressed our needs quickly and efficiently.  She answered questions we asked and provided information and suggestions in response to our situation.  She came back often and asked if we needed anything and if everything was OK.  The receptionist at the desk by the entrance was also very helpful in making sure we got the booth we requested and she even came into the bar area to let us know that the booth was ready when it was time for us to leave the bar and go into the restaurant for dinner.  Our diner waitress, Erin, was also very attentive and provided excellent service from introducing herself to us and going over the menu options, providing information helping us select the perfect dinner choice for each of us.  She was very patient and an excellent server.
She paid extra attention to detail and her personality was very customer friendly.  She was obviously very experienced at her job and professional.  She paid attention to our needs from the time we arrived at her table until we left.  We were extremely pleased with the wine and beer selections.  The meals we ordered were excellent.  The ambiance was pleasant and elegant.  We were delighted at the overall experience.  We plan to return for special occasions.  We were celebrating Bev and Jeff Blossom's 25th wedding  aniversary (a bit late because their actual date was in November, but we wanted the place to be Del Rae & we finally made it there).  The waitress made sure we were treated  with a complimentary slice of delicious chocolate cake, lighted with a candle and she personally acknowledged their anniversary with sincere congratulations.  So, thank you very much, Del Rae for making our dining experience special and memorable :-)    Carole Blossom (Mother of Jeff Blossom)

40,3670,"*Real quick note before i begin* While it wasn't a problem  for me it might be for some. It is valet parking only.

Chose the Dal Rae because of its high ratings and i Had a blast at with my family. We were a party of 8 celebrating my wife's birthday and  the restaurant was very accommodating. Amazing food, great and patient staff, Romantic setting. Highly recommend :).",1
41,3671,"The Lobster Thermidor is absolutely delicious.  I also love the cheesy garlic bread.  Many of the dishes are prepared table side including the Cherries Jubilee and Bananas Foster.  It's always buzzing on Friday and Saturday nights.  If you want a quieter evening, go on a weeknight.",0
42,3672,"The staff was friendly, and they were always close by to attend to your needs. The meal was great, had the peppercorn steak. They had a piano player in the bar area that was extremely friendly, and made our date that much more special. I will be returning to visit my friends again.",0
43,3673,We celebrated my husband's birthday at Dal Rae. Food was excellent albeit on the pricey side. Service was excellent. The staff was most attentive as we were inquired of our dining experience several times by different people. The only downside is their parking situation. There is a required parking fee of $4.50 with or without valet parking.,0

47,3677,"Dal Rae is a classic old school establishment that is thriving and has been for years. Family owned and operated & it shows. 
My 4 Stars on food is judged on my Lobster Tail being served partially cooked. Ruined if by having to send it back as Lobster doesnât reheat/cook well.
The Petit Pepper Filet was very tough for a filet. 
Overall 2 out of 4 meals were excellent.",0
48,3678,Been a customer for 24 years and they never disappoint. Will be back soon.,1

57,3687,This is a great place to have lunch or dinner. The food is delicious!!,1
58,3688,"Had not been back to Dal Rae in a long time and the food was just as I remembered, excellent! I had the Chilean Sea Bass, my wife had the Prime Rib and our daughter had the Filet. All cooked to perfection.",0

65,3695,Wonderful Valentines lunch. Our favorite place to go every year for good food and attentive but non intrusive service.,0
66,3696,"This is truly one of the last of this style of restaurant left in Southern California.  There used to be more of these, including ""Tail of the Cock"" in Beverly Hills area.  The old standards that are still around are Musso & Franks (which has lost it's charm and the food and service the last time was way below par).  ""Lawry's"" has also slipped quite a bit from where it was once.  So, the Dal Rae is now the place to go if you are looking to turn back the clock to mid-century.  The decor is right, the service is exceptional and they still make certain dishes table side--Caesar Salad and flaming Bananas Foster are two examples.  Plus, yes . . . a relish tray to start.  Want to impress your friends, this is the place. Make it special and dress up and get ready for a retro experience.  Their Pepper steak keeps me coming back.  Well worth the drive.  Enjoy!  Denito",0
67,3697,"My wife and I went for a early Valentineâs day lunch today. Doing this today avoided a Special Valentineâs Day menu, long waits and the  crowds. 
We started out with delicious old school cocktails from the bar, that were prepared perfectly.

We started off with chopped salad, (Crisp Bacon, Peeled Tomato, Avocado, Turkey, Onion, Egg, Grated Bleu Cheese & Marinara Dressing). We asked to split the salad as it is quite large (EntrÃ©e size) and big enough to split.

They delivered a breadbasket that was plentiful w/ delicious sourdough, spicy cracker bread & traditional wrapped breadsticks. It went perfectly with the salad.

For my entrÃ©e I had the poor manâs pepper steak. It is a ground angus beef patty smothered in green onions and bacon, omg so good!
It came with their extra creamy mashed potatoes that looked like clouds and they taste amazing light airy and smooth. It also had roasted asparagus on the side....simply great 

My wife had the Chicken piccata it looked delicious, but I actually didn't try it. It came with the mashed potatoes and sautÃ©ed zucchini. It was a little different presentation for chicken piccata as it was prepared with an airline chicken breast (boneless chicken breast with the drumette attached). My wife said it was excellent. 

From the valet to the server the service was exceptional. I would definitely recommend it. Lorin the owner dropped by to say Hi.

Thanks Kevin and Lorin for continuing the tradition for all these years.",0
68,3698,When my wife and I want to sit down and experience a delicious steak thereâs no other place we would rather go. This is an old-school steakhouse experience that you canât pass up,1

106,3736,Dal Rae never fails. We live in Denver but always try to find a reason to go to LA so we can eat here. Prime rib and Caesar salad are amazing. Never had anything else!!  Service is great and the manhattans are killers.,0
107,3737,"Came here for the 2018 DineLA Dinner, and it was fantastic! I ended up getting the Chilean Sea Bass, and was super pleased with this dish! The sea bass itself stayed tender, moist and flaky throughout the meal, and even when I had it next day for leftovers. The French Onion Soup is superb! Plentiful amount of cheesy goodness, and inside of the soup was a generous amount of carmelized onions and bread. I definitely recommend getting this soup. The dessert was a Gold Brick Sundae. The chocolate shell covering the vanilla ice was delicious! My only gripe to this was that the lace cookie shell holding the ice cream was too hard to break into, and impossible to eat. They need to soft that shell a little more. As for service, it was excellent and on point. Our server, Jacki was sweet and professional. I would definitely come back here again!",0
108,3738,"I come for business lunches but rarely at night. It was a special birthday occasion and we had a party of five.  Everything was top notch from beginning to end including tableside specialties,(Caesar salad and Banana Flambe.)

116,3746,"As always, the DalRae was a lovely dining experience.  This visit we brought some friends along that had never experienced the DalRae.  The looks on their faces as they ate each bite said it all.  From the Caesar salad to the Surf n Turf with Chilean Sea Bass all the way through dessert, they were pleased!  Certainly can't complain about that!!  Our visit was extraordinary, our friends loved it and so did we!!",0

HAD A 7:00 PM RESERVATION AND WE WERE SERATED BY 7:15. VERY FESTIVE HOLIDAY ATMOSPHERE.   I WOULD REECCOMEND DAL RAE TO ANYONE ESPECIALLY FOR A ROMANTIC DINNER, DATE NIGHT OR AN ANNIVERSARY. THE FOOD WAS WONDERFUL JUST AS IT HAS BEEN ON EACH OF THE THREE OTHER OCCASIONS THAT WE HAVE DINED THERE. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THE CEASARS SALAD WITH THE TABLESIDE PREPARATION. BEST ONE I HAVE EVER HAD.  I HAD A RIB EYE STEAK WHICH WAS PERFECT AND MY HUSBAND HAD TRHE PRIME RIB WHICH WAS HUGE AND PREPARED PERFECTLY. HAD CREME BRULEE FOR DESSERT AND IT WAS SCRUMPIOUS, VEERY CREAMY AND LIGHTY. ALL IN ALL A GREAT ANNIVERSARY MEAL.",0

134,3764,"Had a lovely late supper at the Dal Rae. Food was great and the service was excellent. The only thing I was disapointing was the music, I thought a pianist or a trio. rather than a guy singing karaoke. Especially on a Saturday nite.  Otherwise it would have been perfect.",0

The bartenders know what they are doing and the cocktails are flawless.  The wait staff are so experienced that even a bustling crowded holiday scene runs like a well-oiled machine.  My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed her birthday lunch there.  The ambience, especially at a time when decorated for Christmas,  was the best.  I appreciate the lighting and cozy feeling at the Dal Rae even with a full dining room.  Why don't other restaurants know about lighting like they do at the Dal Rae?  (i.e. I don't appreciate Stadium lighting when dining out!).  If I could give MORE than 5 stars for the Dal Rae I would.  Looking forward to my next visit!",0

The wine list was very good and we indulged in 2 bottles.  I would highly recommend this place for a special occasion because it is a little expensive, but as they say, you get what you pay for, and at this place you get every penny's worth!  A 5 Star all the way.",0
147,3777,The food and personnel and service is absolutely the best..plus the nice ambiance.,1
148,3778,"The only complaint I have is the menu change.  They have a holiday menu that is VERY limited. I ordered the turkey sandwich and it was very bland and the bread was very hard and dry. It was difficult to bite into the sandwich. I had to switch out the baguette bread for the bread they bring you when you first arrive. I loved the Christmas decorations, they are very festive and beautiful. I will be there again soon for  a business meeting and will order something different. Our server was not very attentive but, maybe because they were busy. Still, for the prices at this place, we should have excellent service. 

Alicia",0
149,3779,"I was there for a business lunch and it was very busy.  I was a little sad that only the holiday menu was available, but understand given the extremely busy atmosphere of the season.

This is a ""Go-to"" spot for business meals for me when in SoCal.  They have a great menu, so ""fru-fru fusion"" stuff here - great fish, seafood, steaks, chops with the classic sides.  Relish tray and bread (flatbread, garlic bread) served to all.  The atmosphere is as it has been since the beginning; these places are hard to find.  The quality of the food and service is impeccable and old school.  I will always return when in SoCal.",0

Then, one day a few months ago my friends and I were in the area and I remembered the lunch date years ago and suggested we make plans for dinner at Dal Rae.  We finally made it and were not disappointed, we'll be back!! Thank you for a really delicious dinner and a very nice evening with friends.

227,3857,"This restaurant was a very nice surprise.  Friendly and attentive service from the moment you arrive. I also appreciate the table side food prep, as this is a lost art nowadays. 

Portions are generous and delicious. Be sure to try the hot cheese bread and the chocolate soufflÃ©.",0

242,3872,The food was great and the atmosphere was amazing.  The only problem here is that the evening lighting needs to be brighter.  I was really a bit ridiculous how dark it was in there for dinner.  I noticed people using flashlights to read the menu.  Many of their clients are elderly. I am far from elderly and I had a tough time.  Perhaps management will take that into consideration.,1
243,3873,It was my dads 92nd birthday.  He has talked about the Dal Rae for ever.  When he was still working they would go to the Dal Rae for meetings and taking clients out to dinner.  He has always talked highly about it so what better place to celebrate him.  Our whole experience was amazing!,0
244,3874,"Nostalgic time travel to the 1960's -- in a good way.  Tableside preparations, dim lighting, luxurious booths.  I visit the Dal Rae about once every two or three years, and I think I like it more each time.  This time I shared the chateaubriand, which came with a sizzling tableside performance.  The meat was perfectly cooked, prime, and evoked jazz saxophone.  Velvet on the palate, draped in a trio of wonderful sauces.  I usually think of this restaurant at Christmastime when they have stuffed decorations everywhere and the bar is packed, but it deserves more attention than it gets during the rest of the year, when its retro elegance takes center stage.  A wonderful evening.",0

Will come back again and highly recommend",1

248,3878,"The Dal Rae never disappoints.  
The old school ambiance starts with the valet service, then when you step in to the restaurant you walk in to a large bar with an excellent selection of liquor, then sitting down you have huge dining rooms that have 1950/60's decor  to view.  What an entrance.  
The Cesar Salad table side is fun to watch and another way to interact with one of the many wonderful personnel at Dal Rae.   The varied menu for all types of foodies to the wonderful desserts and lastly the world class level of service make the Dal Rae a winner and a must visit.",0

Enjoy!!",0
264,3894,"Poor Man's Pepper Steak and Mashed Potatoes are Delish!  The NY Cheesecake was smooth, creamy and very tasty also.  The crab lump filled mushrooms as appetizer are my favorite here.

283,3913,"Great steaks, prime rib and seafood. This restaurant consistently gives a quality meal with the perfect ambience for all types of events as well as everyday dining. The only ""flaw"" I can comment on is that our waiter did not mention the specials and once we overheard another waiter present them we changed our order. Fortunately the staff was very accommodating. However, our waiter did double charge us for the meal we ultimately changed to and had to ask for a revised bill. Otherwise, a great restaurant based upon the large selection of entrees and the consistent quality of the food.",0

342,3972,"I had not been here in 47 years!  Yes, 47 years. ago I came to this restaurant for my 10th Birthday and loved it then and love it now.  Like a walk down memory lane but the best part was the food was incredible.  Example of above and beyond service?  I asked for sliced tomatoes to go with my filet mignon and expected a couple of plain slices on my plate...  No - that's not this restaurants level of service.  Instead, I received a side plate of beef steak tomatoes with a fab balsamic dressing drizzled on top and crumbled bleu cheese.  Yummy.   My friend ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and it was incredible.  When I mentioned it was her birthday upon arrival they were sure to bring a piece of chocolate cake with a candle lit at the end of the lunch.  Very enjoyable and the place was packed.  I will definitely be back and very soon.",0

346,3976,"An icon in the valley, and for a good reason.  Has a slightly older nostalgic vibe, yet elligant as well.  My ribeye was cooked to perfection.  I relay liked that the meal came with  vegetable and a side, unlike most steak houses that serve everything a la carte.  Our server was outstanding, friendly, informative and attentive.  While the restaurant has the look of elegance set back in an era before my time, it was not stuffy.  This is a true diamond in the ruff, a place I was always curious about growing up.  I will definitely go back.  And by the way, the crembrule is delicious!!",0
347,3977,"Our meal was just outstanding in every way from the lemon-drop martini's, to the wine with dinner & the wonderful entrees (especially the Chilean Sea bass which is beyond exquisite).

352,3982,"Dal Rae has been doing the same great job for years. It is well worth the drive from Orange county. Compared to computable restaurants , I think your drink prices are ""a  
Little "" high.
Don't change anything. ..great place.",1
353,3983,Had an anniversary dinner and it was amazing. Great service and great food. Followed by delicious desserts. Pepper steak is a must. Carrie is the best!,1

355,3985,The food was impecable. The servicewas outstanding. Doesn't get any better than this.,1
356,3986,"This wonderful destination has been around for decades.  First discovered it in the '70s when I was working in Whittier.  This is where I will go if I have company in town that I want to experience what a ""special night out"" used to mean.  Great steaks and fresh seafood.  Beef is prepared the way it used to be done in the '60s-'80s.  They even start with a relish tray; who does that anymore?  You've got to visit this place when you want to enjoy a wonderful meal in a classy setting.",0
357,3987,"My husband and his friends use this restaurant as a convenient get together spot.  The men drive in from a little bit of everywhere in order to have great food, great drinks.  It's been a favorite for yers.",1

361,3991,Engagement celebrations,1
362,3992,"The Dal Rae is what restaurants used to be and should be. A classic, cozy and elegant interior with great service. Caesar salad made tableside. Great pepper steaks, assorted seafood, prime rib and everything else that steakhouses are trying to copy, but the Dal Rea was there many years before to create the menu. For what you get the prices are very reasonable. If it's a special occasion or just out for a great meal, this is the place. If you want to surprise someone and you are coming from the San Fernando Valley or the Westside, the Dal Rae in Pico Rivera will be an unexpected treat!",0
363,3993,We have been going to this restaurant for over 40 years..  Even though we moved further away we still go back.   It is only one of a few old time dinner houses but is not out dated.    They have a great menu and we have never been disappointed.,0

367,3997,Was just as great as I remembered it. My daughter loved it and can't wait to go with me again. It had so many things on the menu that we love that it was hard to pick what to order. The service was so good that it felt like we had our own private server. It's a place that will be in my top pick for the rest of my life. I hope it never changes.,1
368,3998,Another wonderful meal at Dal Rae! My husband and I love bringing friends and family to DR... especially if they have never been to DR before. This is what brought us to DR once again.  And it never lets us down. It's hard to try new items on the menu because each time we order something it is so yummy and its hard not Rio order the same dish. The N.Y. steak with peppercorns is an easy choice and is delicious everytime.  Slam dunk. One of our guests tried the Veal Picata and was in heaven. TheVeal coupled with zucchini rounded out the simple but delicious dish. Another had the pork chop and said they were in heaven while eating it. The Seabass is also a frequent request and DR delivers it perfectly every time.  Pairing great food with an excellent wait staff makes dinner at DR special every time we arrive. Price doesn't matter because we know that an evening at DR will be an evening to remember.,0
369,3999,Excellent menu and all in our party thoroughly enjoyed entrees. Service was great and DO NOT miss out on the chocolate soufflÃ©ð,0
370,4000,"What more can you say about the Dae Ray been coming here for over 35 years lunch and many dinners.....Great food with great servers our last server Dawn was a jewel she was attentive without being to pushy. The drinks were great my wife had the Shrimp Louie and she compared it with Buzios in Vegas which she though was the best she has ever had....Here she liked it as well I had meat as i normally do this time the small pepper filet....Outstanding can not eat like I did  when I was in my 30s and 40s Smaller but fantastic....Next time have to try the lobster large one again...table next to us had it and it was huge. All in all this is a place that you have to try even if is not a special occasion.... its like you have to go to New Orleans or Rio before you expire
Enjoy",0
371,4001,"A night at the Dal Rea is one of the best dining experiences in the San Gabriel Valley.

385,4015,This was our second time at the Dal Rae.  Food was great!  Service was great!  Our dinner guests ordered the made at the table caesar salad.  We will be getting this next time.

Great service, great food.
I will definitely be returning.",1
388,4018,"Always great food, but the reservation is only good as a backup because you have to wait around 20min to get seated regardless of your reservation",0
389,4019,"From the relish dish to the bread basket followed by the delicious cheese bread plus the courteous and trained to please the wishes of the diner friendly servers, DalRae's is the
first choice of our family to celebrate special occasions.  There aren't many restaurants
remaining that are a blast to the past.  One is never disappointed by the preparation of
their delicious meals.

We usually order their prepared at your table Caesar's salad.  There aren't many restaurants
that make this salad as delectable as DalRae's.  An added attraction on our last visit was
to have the youngest members of our family help to make it.

I highly recommend DalRae's!",0

Looking forward to going back.,0
397,4027,"Although this is an excellent restaurant, I will only visit every few years from now on. I do not appreciate having to wait 35 minutes for a table even though I have reservations. I usually go for special occasions such as New Year's and Valentines Day and it's always the same BS.  I can go to other 4-5 star restaurants without reservations and wait 30-40 minutes, so why keep putting up with it here?",1

Wonderful to see the diversity in diners---young, middle age, older, families, couples, large groups, people celebrating---with everyone appearing very happy with their meals and experience.

It is located in the City of Commerce, which can discourage you, but it is worth the unsightly drive.  We were very pleased with the quality of the steaks we ordered.

466,4096,"Absolutely beautiful winter holiday decor added to the restaurant's ambiance. Dinner was smartly served on an oversized dinner or charger plate thereby avoiding piling up the food. Service, at times, was a little bit slow, but what does one expect on Thanksgiving Day.

Very easy access from the 605 Freeway. This is my newest favorite restaurant.",0
467,4097,"We had a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner with the folks at Dal Rae. We were seated timely, according to our reservation. The food, service and entire experience was top notch!",0
468,4098,"The food was absolutely amazing. It is not cheap, but well worth the price. The service was excellent. Our waitress Heidi checked on us often, for drinks, to see if everything was going well and to see if we needed anything. I had the 24 oz. Lobster Tail, it was the best I have ever had. So big, I had the other half for lunch the next day. We will go again, and as often as we can. Just loved it.",0
469,4099,Caesar salad and Bananas foster are fantastic and fixed table side. Great atmosphere for a 50's style place.,1
470,4100,"The food is always outstanding!  Great atmosphere.  Throw back to those old steakhouses.  Our server, Sylvia, was fantastic!",1
471,4101,"WOW, How do you start?  We thought we left home with plenty of time and the LA Freeways had another idea.  Call Dal Rae and they cordially told me to ""Drive Safely"" they will be waiting.  The Valet met us on arrival and we enter to an exceptionally warm reception and were promptly seated.  Drink orders were taken and a Relish tray and wonderful bread basket arrived for munching as we perused the menu. The Maitre 'd welcomed us to the Dal Rae and we had a wonderful conversation about the Dal Rae.  We actually started going to the Dal Rae for Special Occasions in the late 1970' and have thoroughly enjoyed the Cuisine and the attention to perfection, which is one of it's trademarks.  A throw back to the Era of Fine Dining. The elegant booths and tables welcome you to a dark paneled interior and a sense of luxury.  My wife ordered the Trademark Peppered Filet with baked potato and asparagus and I selected the most scrupulous Chilean Sea Bass with baked potato and asparagus.  We ordered a Caesar Salad which the Maitre'd prepared at our table.  It was excellent and was accompanied with wonderful garlic toast.  The waitress was phenomenal  and the pace of service ensured that every item we ordered was at the optimum temperature.   It was my Bride, of 52 years, 75th Birthday and the Dal Rae presented her with a delicious lemon cake with delectable lemon icing and a candle.  This really took us back to the era of Fine Dining that existed in the Mid 1900's. Truly ""Putting on the Dal Rae"" like the ""Ritz"".",0
472,4102,"Dining at Dal Rae is always a special occasion. The cuisine  is incredible, the service is impeccable, and the entire staff  goes out of their way to make their guests feel special. We had the steak Diane, and as usual, it was perfection.",0

488,4118,I brought my 19 year old granddaughter to dinner to celebrate her birthday and she was impressed with the ambiance and astounded by the petite filet as it melted in her mouth! She gushed all evening about her dinner and taunted family members at her good fortune of dinner at Dal Rae's!,0
489,4119,We have been going to Dal Rae's for years and it never disappoints.  The food is great.  The fish and beef are especially good.  It is not cheap but it is worth the price.,1

Can't wait to come back!",0
491,4121,"Food is always exceptional. Service seems to be a priority with management.

492,4122,This restaurant and their staff never disappoint!!  Been coming here for the last 20 years...,1
493,4123,"This is my all-time fav. restaurant.  I have been a patron for at least 50 yrs.  Both my daughters were introduced to the Dal Rae  @ an early age & they still enjoy it.
Good place to celebrate any occasion or just a place to enjoy life.  My girlfriend and I started a tradition a few years ago of having Christmas meal there and enjoying our friendship instead of gift exchange.  
Iâm wishing them many more years of a successful business. 
bon appetit",1

496,4126,"Always a lovely, special place for dinner whether it be a special occasion or just an excellent meal.  The food is always good; the service is attentive.  I always feel that the Dal Rae is happy to have me come; someone from management always stops by.  We had the prime rib, which I think is some of the best.  I also love their medallions and their chilean sea bass.  The extra touches of two different bread baskets, an iced relish tray, and a baked potato prepared table side make for a special dining experience, but not a stuffy one.",0
497,4127,Good food and excellence service.  Location is central.  Great for special occasion and family gathering.  Friendly personnel from top to bottom.  Great wine list.  Chop salad is the best in town.,1

504,4134,"Have been to 10 Zagat 20+ restaurants in July-Sep. Service by Mary Jane was the best among all ten servers. Examples: Quickly moved us to another booth when our booth was in direct AC flow. Our rez was for 9pm, but she never rushed us; nice pace throughout entire meal. Explained unfamiliar menu items clearly. Packaged to-go leftovers to our special spec; held Caesars in fridge so it remained cold. At most restaurants, to-go packaging is treated as afterthought, but not here. This is important because Dal Rae portions are very generous.",0

521,4151,"The food and selection is fantastic.  Very pricy but great for special occasion.
Old style, booths which are small for 4 people ask for the bigger booths.

Had the sea bass and filet mignon combination that was expensive and I would not do the combination again and just get one or the other.  

The only complaint on the food, and everyone in my party agreed that the bread basket was horrible bread not what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant, even the garlic bread that came with dinner was terrible.  The need to have better bread presentation that tastes good.

Food otherwise is excellent.",0
522,4152,Much better than my other recent dinners elsewhere,1
523,4153,"We went with another couple and all of us raved about our dinners.  We had the ahi tuna on toast appetizer and baked brie.  Two had the Dal Rae Pepper Steak, one had prime rib and one had a New York steak.  All were excellent.",0

544,4174,"The Dal Rae is one of our favorite restaurants, we've never had a bad meal. 
It's a throw back to a hipper time when folks dressed nice and enjoyed a true dining experience. The best advise? Go hungry, really hungry. I love the relish tray & bread basket they deliver as soon as you're seated, it's great to sip your cocktail and have a little something while you browse the extensive menu. 
Most times we've dine here we've had either the prime rib or their famous pepper steak, if you're a true corovore you'll love both! 
I have also had the lobster tail, crab legs & the lobster club sandwich. Everything I've had here has been delicious.
For the shrimp lovers try thr Rock Shrimp appetizer it's crispy and the sweet spicy sticky sauce is the perfect compliment. The scallops are great too, as is the elephant garlic & Brie appitezer. 
The salads are HUGE, best advise here is to split a salad, the wedge, the crab Louis & table side Cesar salads are fresh and delicious.
Try and save room for dessert too!",0
545,4175,Great service and wonderful food in the beautiful old school way.,1
546,4176,"Other reviews have said it before- this place is a steakhouse from the days of yore. Dark, quiet, with a formal atmosphere, it is as though the place was transported straight from the 60s to it's present location. Completely unprepossessing on the outside, looking like a rundown coffee shop really, it is 1960s elegant inside. The food, while on the pricey side, is exceptional. We ordered the Caesar salad for two, prepared table side by the manager, and it was the most delicious Caesar either of us had ever had! That was followed by petit filets, cooked to a perfect medium, flavorful and tender. We ordered souffles for dessert-- Grand Marnier for her and chocolate for me-- and they were hot, fluffy delights! The service was as wonderful as the food, unobtrusive, but Johnny on the spot when needed. All in all, a perfect way to celebrate our tenth anniversary!",0
547,4177,"Excellent in every way. We had an 8:00 rez but my friend arrived late, so we were not finished by the time the kitchen closed @ 10. To their credit, no one at Dal Rae rushed us or even pushed us in the usual passive-aggressive way to wrap it up and leave. One of us ordered from the DineLA menu, one from the regular menu. Both meals were exceptional. Everyone was cordial. At departure, the valet thanked us for coming & invited us back. A+ attitude by all. There's a reason Dal Rae has prospered for so long: Food/Decor/Service...I'd give Dal Rae a Zagat 28 which would put them in the Top 20 for all of LA.",0
548,4178,"Been going to Dal Rae for over 30 years!  Food is fabulous & the service is perfect!
Looking forward to our next trip back!",1
549,4179,"Dal Rae is a classic place and there are not that many remaining. It's dark, the drinks are traditional and the food is rich and delicious. The service is highly recommended and the place is always full. There is nothing trendy or ""foodie"" about Dal Rae. They have and maintain high standards.",1
550,4180,"As always, my friends and I found the food and service at the Dal Rae to be great.  The fact that it's open late on weekday nights is a plus because it allows us to get together for dinner and talk after work.",1

554,4184,"The location is very convenient, easy to access, and great find. The service was wonderful from valet, to hostess, waitress, and back to valet. The food was delicious, and the waitress was knowledgeable about the preparation of the meals, making it easy to trust her recommendations. Highly recommend.",0
555,4185,The experience was good as usual.  Unfortunately we had a reservation for 7:30   and had to wait.  We finally decided to remind  the hostess  that we were still waiting  about 40 minutes later. I think they had forgotten about us because we were then seated right away!  Food and service was great.,0
556,4186,I have been coming to the Dal Rae for years as my Father lived in the neighborhood and he and I dined there often.  The food is always wonderful and the service couldn't be any better.  My husband and myself have introduced many friends and family to the restaurant and everyone loves it as much as we do.  This last Saturday we met my college roommate and her husband there (they drove in from Huntington Beach and we came in from Beverly Hills) and it was another terrific night at the Dal Rae.  It was especially nice since it would have been my Father's 100th birthday that day had he lived.  We raised our glasses to him for lots of reasons and one was introducing me to the Dal Rae years ago.  I hope there will be many years for all of us and other generations to enjoy.,0
557,4187,We had a great lunch and a good Server Dawn.  My friend and I had not seen each other for several months so we wanted to catch up.   Foot was so good.

560,4190,Classic steakhouse. Really excellent professional servers serving very high quality food. Enjoyed the mid century ambience and clearly a very regular customer base.,1
561,4191,"I enjoyed everything, just one problem, my husband ordered the fried shrimp boat. The shrimp was not completely cooked and it was soggy and stringy, he should have sent it back but felt funny doing that. And by the time the rest of us realized his dilemma it was too late. He is handicapped and in a wheel chair.",0
562,4192,"OVERALL: great experience, my date and I decided to try something different as far as as food goes. She ordered the duck which was a great experience. It tasted like a mix of chicken and turkey and I Ordered the veal. The veal needed a little salt for my taste but  overall fantastic. I did feel a little rushed towards the end with our waiter but I can't blame him the place was packed and I'm sure people were waiting to sit. We then decided to go over to the piano bar, the chairs  are a little to low but the singer was great. Overall, great experience and ambiance. Would recommend to others.",1
563,4193,"Dal Rae has been a favorite dining spot for many years.  The food is outstanding.  My friend ordered a big steak which he was delighted with & some left over.  I ordered crab cakes from the appetizer list and the serving was ample size to satisfy me as an entree.  We shared the delicious  wilted spinach salad which was prepared at our table.  We both enjoyed our meals immensely.
The restaurant was dimly lit for a romantic date night dinner.  We will definitely return!",0

I have never been here before but was so impressed by the whole experience - from the time I exited the car at the valet (he was such a gentleman helping me out of the car!), to the server, to my food, to the amazing soufflÃ© dessert! Everything was top notch. It was nice to see the manager constantly walking the tables to check on the patrons and even helping with setting tables.

I ordered the Chilean sea bass, it was so good! Highly recommended! The only thing I would change is the bread basket. The bread is ok, but there are these triangle crackers that tasted hard, dry and stale.",0
591,4221,"Decided to come here for dinner with friends. My husband and I hadn't seen our friends for a number of years, so we wanted a special place that was elegant but not too fancy. We had a great time. The wait staff was friendly and attentive, the meal choices were plenty and everyone in our party had a great meal.

602,4232,"My husband and I celebrated our 10th Wedding Anniversary by enjoying a delicious dinner at Dal Rae. We had been once before and decided it would be a perfect place to return to for that special occasion. We were not disappointed. Oysters Rockefeller were outstanding, their signature Pepper Steak - exceptional. Our server was very professional and accommodating. The noise level was a little more than what we would have liked, but our overall experience was wonderful.",0
603,4233,Always the best service and delicious food.,1
604,4234,"Outstanding menu,food,service, ambiance, etc. One of the best restaurants in Los Angeles!",1
605,4235,"We will be coming to Dal Rae more often. There is such variety on the menu.  Everything from cold seafood appetizers to escargot, veal Marsala to prime beef to seafood and abalone.   Dal Rae still serves a vegetable relish at the same time as their breadbasket.  Nice to have the option if you are passing on bread (but he bread is so good). 

If you enjoy the old style continental cuisine with traditional excellent service, this is one of the few left in Southern California. This is the place not to miss",0
606,4236,"Great food, awesome service, food presentation excellent!!!",1
607,4237,This place beats some of the well-known (high priced) steak houses that I have been to. I will definitely choose Dal Rae over the others. I have been telling so many people about my experience this past week. I cannot wait to return!,1
608,4238,"had earlier arrived for business meetings in LA and the group wanted steak, dozens of great ones in LA, but someone mentioned Dal Rae. well 45 minutes inn traffic we found Dal Rae.  Im glad we did.  The atmosphere is delightful, clubby, warm and traditional.  a place where you would feel comfortable with family or friends.  a relish tray (throwback to the 50's) is put on the table first with warm bread. The menu is extensive with something for everyone.  Our group tried the Sea Bass, filet mignon, veal chop and more. all perfect.  Im a wine snob and there was enough of a selection to make me happy.  Its a little out of the way to find but well worth it.",0
609,4239,"We went here to celebrate an anniversary, the food was awesome. My wife ordered the Chilean Sea Bass a'la Ben, very flavorful and probably the best fish dish ever had. I ordered the Brady Cut prime rib and wow was it huge, the end area of this meat was my favorite as the inside rare piece lacked some seasoning, maybe a side of au jus would've done the trick, the good thing is I took home the big piece left of my prime rib and had steak and eggs for breakfast the next day so it didn't go to waste. All in all, great time had.",0
610,4240,Love Dal Rae!  The food is excellent and the service is outstanding.,1
611,4241,"This is a FANTASTIC steakhouse!! Reminds me of Golden Steer in Vegas ... Great service (Jacqui) and attentiveness ... quality and delicious from drinks to food!!

Best escargot I've had in years ... make sure you try the garlic toast ... well poured drinks:)) That ain't no shrimp, they were shrimp on steroids. Steaks were right temperature and prime rib = WOW!

This place is BETTER than Morton's. So GOOD, I'm going back next weekend.",0
612,4242,"What a delightful experience! There aren't too many places that create your Caesar salad and bananas foster tableside anymore. I certainly enjoyed that! The food was wonderful, but what really stood out for me was the service. The staff at Dal Rae is top notch. I have been in customer service for over 20 years and because of that I am very critical of everything that has to do with customer service. I have experienced both the good and the bad and I have to say the service there is exceptional. For one thing, they work as a team and although we were served by waitstaff other than our own, they always had a smile on their faces and truly seemed to take pleasure waiting on us. Thank you for the awesome experience and the next time we visit LA, we'll be sure to make a reservation!",0
613,4243,"Seafood here is delicious. Ahi on toast, Chilean sea bass and scallops. The Caesar salad is great too made right at your table by one of the owners. This place never disappoints with amazing service.",0
614,4244,My family and I have been going to this restaurant for many years.  The food is always delicious!  My favorite is the Halibut A La Ben accompanied with a Moscato.  For dessert I recommend the Bananas FlambÃ© they're to die for!,1
615,4245,"Nostalgic, hidden gem!  Delicious  food, great ambiance and excellent service.",1
616,4246,"Had a great meal, great service. Never does the Dal Tae disappoint. Tried the famous pepper steak for the first time, it was great! Wife had the Seabass alla Ben which is a repeat from other visits, and in my opinion the best option on the menu. Will definitely return in the future!",0
617,4247,"The Dal Rae continues to be my go-to restaurant when meeting friends from all over southern california.  It's a good halfway spot with great food, a great bar - perfect in all respects.",1
618,4248,"We love going to This place for special occasions. We are always impressed with the food quality. Highly reccomend, pricy but worth every penny.",1
619,4249,"Came on V-day knowing it would be crowded but the food and service was not compromised at all! Each plate ordered in our party of four was perfect- rib eye, New York steak, steak Diane and prime rib - cooked as ordered, juicy and tender! The salads are a meal in themselves- must try the mixed green salad with old fashioned blue cheese dressing . We had dessert and they were scrumptious too! If looking for a special place to eat ,this is it! Money well spent!!!",0

The assortment to bread and crackers, garlic bread and the relish plate were also very excellent! Looking forward to spending every special occasion here!",0
624,4254,We enjoyed another fine dining experience at Dal Rae restaurant. I recommended this restaurant to many friends and acquaintances many have been there and They say they love it.,1
625,4255,"This would be a wonderful place to take parents, grandparents-it is like entering an era gone by.  There are several menu items which are prepared table side.
We enjoyed the escargot (nice and garlicky), filet mignon (so tender) and the caesar salad.  All was very good.  
Recommend for a special occasion dinner.",0
626,4256,Great waitress. Outstanding food. Exceptional dining.,1
627,4257,"My friends and I frequent this restaurant because the food is great, the service is excellent and the restaurant is open later than most during the week.  We are able to visit as long as we choose without any problem from any of the restaurant staff.  The noise level, however, is sometimes really way too loud and the restaurant does pack a lot of tables into the dining room, so you are very close to your neighbors when dining.  That said, we still love this restaurant.",0
628,4258,"Dined last Sunday evening, the final day to take advantage of the special deal for restaurant week.  What a pleasant surprise!  This establishment is a throw back, especially with the Sinatra tunes playing in the background; a good old-fashioned steak house.  The courses were large, not pinched like some restaurants serve during this period.  Filet mignon and the sea bass were prepared and presented flawlessly, served with the best baked potato I have had in some time.  Our server, China, was personable and attentive.  Well done people!",0
629,4259,"This is the only place I've been where everything on the menu is good! Great ambiance, great service, great food. Wanna go somewhere for a truly vip experience, this is the place!",1
630,4260,"Eating at DalRae is great. The service, food and knowing the history of these restaurant makes it a special night each time we go. I like the managers coming around to ask how things are going and don' t hesitate to help put when they see the need.",1
631,4261,Our group had a memorable dinner here.  The tableside Caesar salad is served with a generous amount of dressing with great garlicky flavor.  The Chilean sea bass alla Ben was cooked perfectly.  Ended the meal with the Brick Sundae which is served within a cookie. Our service was impeccable too.,0
632,4262,They haven't let us down. Great food at a reasonable price.,1
633,4263,The food is outstanding and the service is top notch .  China was our server and she was just excellent  definitely will go again.,0
634,4264,"We finally made it to Dal Rae!  Long on our to do list--but not visited until last week.  We went Restaurant Week to cut the cost some.  Service was wonderful.  Everything was delicious.  The $49 prix fixe menu was a good deal.  For our entrees we had the signatures dishes--pepper filet and Chilean Sea Bass.  We would recommend both.  As our two favorite special occasion restaurants nearer to us have closed, Dal Rae will be our go to place--liked it way more than 555, PF Flemings, and Ruth Chris--which has been our alternatives.  Only negative--$4.50 for valet parking?  Seemed to have a big parking lot and not really needed.",0
635,4265,party of 5..each had a different entree...all superb...brought back good memories!,1
636,4266,"As always, never disappointed. We dined during the the Los Angeles Restaurant Week, I had the special menu for the evening. $49--Lobster bisque, Filet mignon pepper steak (with sides), New York cheesecake--it was all amazing. And, the portions were plentiful. My dining companions enjoyed Ceasar salad, liver and onions, and veal Oscar. Where else in LA can you get this meal? To top it off, I had a fabulous Justin Cabernet.

After dinner, we enjoyed the music of Dianne in the piano lounge--all in all, a perfect evening.

The service was perfect--we were treated like the queens that we are!",0
637,4267,Best over all restaurant experience we've had in 10 years!! Bravo!,1
638,4268,"We had a delightful evening at Dal Rae.  Some of us had the pepper steak and declared it delicious!  I had the filet medallions -- they were wonderful: tender and perfectly prepared.  The meal came with vegetable and potato -- all prepared with the right amount of seasoning.  

The server was friendly but not overly so -- the restaurant is open, in the 50's style; which is not surprising since that is probably when it was built -- not cozy.  They were tolerant of our granddaughter's foibles and she ate heartily too.  We were stuffed but not so much that we passed on the yummy chocolate souffle.  

We will definitely return.",0
639,4269,"Both my wife and I cannot think of a better place to celebrate our anniversary, we will be going back!",1
640,4270,The French Onion Soup was delicious.  The broth was light yet very flavorful.  The cheese was plentiful and delicious.   My Crab Louie Salad was full of crab and the dressing was classic.  The bread basket had various choices of bread and crackers and they were all wonderful.  The service was excellent and our waitress brought me a complimentary lemon cake that was light and delicious.  I can't wait to go back and take my husband to this wonderful restaurant.,0
641,4271,We miss the standard continental cuisine which offers table side service.  Dal Rae is a gem.  The variety of the menu and a few of the classics table side make this one of the rare restaurants which appeals to a wide range of classic tastes.  Not everyone wants cutting edge or nouveau,0
642,4272,"After losing the Dal Rae in Fullerton, CA we thought there would never be another place so perfect for that special occasion, with great food and ambiance.  Dal Rae Pico Rivera is a sweet find that is family to the one in Fullerton.  We were so pleased to find all the items we loved so much on the menu here.  Everything just as delicious and presented just as beautiful.  Our server, Mary Jane, was very attentive and genuinely interested in our special day.  
Watching our Cesare salad prepare at our table was an event in itself.  Our brie and garlic appetizer was so good and flavorful!  The garlic shrimp and the peppered steak was perfectly prepared.  The great thing about Dal Rae is that it is a fine place to eat anytime, not just for special occasions.  We did see young children there, so it is a place for the whole family.  I know there are items for children on the menu, so I would say bring them along and let them experience the art of fine dining.",0
643,4273,"If you want a traditional old school fine dining restaurant, this is the place.  Impeccable service and outstanding food.  Old style, deep leather booths or tables if you prefer.  Great cocktails, made just to your liking.  Cesar salad prepared fresh at your table with all fresh ingredients.  Garlic cheese bread you can't find anywhere else this tasty.  Steaks are to die for whether they are charbroiled or their signature pepper steak, just delicious.  Their fish is also amazing and don't forget to have dessert, even if you must unbutton your pants.",0
644,4274,Christmas decorations were beautiful.  Will be returning.,1
645,4275,"The vibe is the 50's with expertly preparded food! Fantastic steaks and seafood. Tableside service for amazing carfted salads!

646,4276,"I've been to the Dal Rae a few times before. It's a a destination restaurant as there isn't much else around it. 
However, it's without a doubt the best food and seriously amazing service like you've never experienced. 
We had a group of six for dinner. The food was outstanding, I had the crab legs (which I also enjoyed the next day for lunch!) the others ordered the sea bass which was apparently  awesome, or their famous peppercorn steaks- which was noted to be the ""best steak I ever had"". We all shared a beautiful Caesar salad prepared tableside by a very distinguished gentleman. We also enjoyed the shrimp appetizer, which I thought would be heavy as its fried, but actually a very light batter. Their bread...oh, seriously amazing bread. 
For desert we shared the creme brÃ»lÃ©e, a decadent chocolate on chocolate on chocolate concoction, and ice cream served in a lacy sugar shell. Heaven. 
They have a team of servers who discretely cater to your every need. These are professional servers, not aspiring actors, and we feel like a VIP every time we visit!",0
647,4277,"We highly recommend Del Rae.  Our server Dawn was welcoming, friendly and professional. The food was incredible.  We had the grilled filet mignon and the pepper steak. Melted in our mouth.
We celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary.  Very romantic. Quiet. We had a late lunch. 
Will definitely return.   I'm sure they are kid friendly but I would not bring my children. 
The ambiance was wonderful and very adult.  Very classy. We do not drink alcohol and we were very happy that they still catered to us. Take the time to go.",0
648,4278,"Been going to the Dal Rae for many years, since I was a teenager, actually. I am now a senior citizen and still enjoy an annual visit. Sometimes you just need that seasoned ambiance and very respectful and polite service.  Of course, the food is always good or I would not have been returning for 50 years!",1
649,4279,"Lovely evening of dining was had by  myself and two friends. We had a 8pm reservation but had to wait a little after to be seated, which wasn't bad considering it was Christmas Eve. The place was every prettily decorated. Can't say enough about the Cesar salad, it was amazing best I ever had. Every one enjoyed our meals and the service was good.",1
650,4280,Very old school steak house but with a nicely maintained and appointed interior.  Great bar.   Escargot was fantastic;  hasn't had that in years.   Caesar salad was peppered tables idea and had the perfect combination of garlic and anchovy.  Christmas duck was tender and not gamey.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Hadn't been here.in 30 years but will be back!,0

655,4285,Great place for a business lunch or dinner.,1
656,4286,"I have been coming to Dal Rae for over 50 yrs. In fact I am your oldest customer since I went to the Colony Club in Omaha in the early  1950's when I was a medical student at Creighton. I particularly enjoy tour fish selections- they are the best!

It's so good to have a fine restaurant so close to home!",0
657,4287,"Really enjoyable!  Excellent food, great service!  I would definitely recommend this place, especially to anyone who is celebrating a special occasion or holiday.  The restaurant was decorated beautifully for Christmas!",1
658,4288,The extra amenities like the relish tray and two bread baskets were an added treat. The menu is a little pricey but well worth the money. Christmas lights were just beautiful lending a special atmosphere. We will return as often as we can but especially to celebrate special occasions.,0
659,4289,"Everything we ordered was absolutely amazing; we got the oyster Rockefeller, the famous peppered steak, and the seared ahi tuna steak. The atmosphere was on point and every time I passed the bar it was going off. Our server was a little cold at first and seemed to be lacking humor but she was still nice and efficient. 
I've been thinking about our dinner every night since. I can't wait to go back.",1
660,4290,"Great meal, ambiance and service, will certainly return.",1

669,4299,"Fantastic menu with classic recipes, many of which are prepared table side, including caesar salad, steak Diane, and cherries Jubilee.  They are known for the pepper steak and prime rib, both of which looked amazing.  They have chocolate soufflÃ©.  Need I say more?  The only problem for us is the location....way out in Pico Rivera.",0
670,4300,"It was our 50th wedding anniversary.  We've been to the Dal Rae many times before and knew that we would be very happy with the service and the food.  They did not dissapoint.

The menu is wonderful and never disappoints.  My all-time favorite is the Lobster Thermidor served at dinner but, if you don't find something you want at lunchtime, just ask for it as we did and the chef may just make it for you.  We had Chicken Cordon Bleu which was off the menu but the Dal Rae accommodated us because we remembered how good it was from a past visit.

Our suprise was the bill...much lower than we had expected.  A place we need to make more of a habit again instead of just special occasions.  And next time I'll call ahead a couple of days so I can treat myself to the amazing sweetbreads that left the permanent menu a few years ago.",0

We had a 50th birthday party there several years ago for about 30 plus people and food and service was outstanding.  We usually go for family birthdays or special occasions because it is on the pricey side, but well worth it.  Reservations recommended!",0
707,4337,"This place reminds me of the old Arches in Newport Beach. Classic old style steak house with all the great dishes. Ceasar salad made table side, flambaed dish made table side and classic flambaed desserts. Creat special occasion dinner spot and an awesome lunch place.",0
708,4338,"It was my 1st time and everyone that had been there recommended the pepper steak. Well, I ordered it and I must say it was the best steak I have ever eaten.  I will go back but will try other items I'm sure but the pepper steak I will have again.",0
709,4339,"What a fantastic place to go, for business and pleasure.  We were very impressed with every aspect of service, food, selection.  In the finest tradition, classic, with the nostalgia of Musso & Frank, but it's own perfection and unique style.  Highly recommend, my new favorite restaurant in this part of Los Angeles.  Bravo!",1
710,4340,"This is one of our all time favorite LA area restaurants. It is well worth the long drive to step back in time and have lovely service, a great menu with super specials, and that Caesar salad prepared next to your table. The bar also know how to make a martini! Three of us shared the Tomahawk steak special, and the 4th person shared her Petrale Sole. We can't speak highly enough for the quality of the food and the wonderful service.",0
711,4341,"Open table made it very convenient to make a reservation.  Arrived on a busy evening and reservation was perfect walked right in from friendly valet, checked in  and were seated immediately. The whole dining experience was a perfect way to celebrate our anniversary.

714,4344,It does not get getter than dinner at Dal Rae's! Wonderful servers delicious food and happy ambiance.,1
715,4345,"This is a treasure of a restaurant that consistently serves outstanding cuisine with an amazing dinner menu.  A variety of items makes a final decision a most difficult one, but seafood entrees, veal and steak dishes are the best and expertly prepared.  Table side Caesar Salad by the master restaurant manager is phenomenal and noteworthy.  Consistently good food has sustained this long established restaurant for many years and will into the future.",0
716,4346,Must have the ahi on toast and the Chilean sea bass!! It's the best!!,1

718,4348,"My friends and I frequently dine at the Dal Rae.  The food is delicious, high quality, and always prepared the way you want it.  The service is impeccable.  Both server and bus person are always exceptionally attentive and never rush you.  This is leisurely dining at its best.  The restaurant is always crowded so reservations are a must.",0
719,4349,So nice to still have a place like this to go   Elegant and great food and service,1
720,4350,this is the place for fine dining in a casual setting,1
721,4351,I decided to take my family  to this restaurant because I had heard great reviews from close friends and because we were celebrating my daughter's 18th birthday. She loves and appreciates a good steak and this place did not let me down.  Thank you for making my daughter's birthday a memorable experience.,0
722,4352,"Dal Rae is truly a diamond class dinner house. Food and service, always excellent. It is always a treat and joy to dine here. Been coming since I was a kid in the late 60's. Wish they would expand their ""table side"" and ""specialty dishes"" a tad more. That is what puts Dal Rae ahead of the crowd.",0
723,4353,"Dal Rae is our special spot for celebrating. Without fail we will order the same thing every time. I highly recommend the table side Caesar salad. It is the best salad you will ever have. The service is impeccable and the floor managers always make sure you are being well taken care of. For us, this is our place. Its a gem, a through back to when people would dress to dine in a fine restaurant.",0
724,4354,"The food and service are outstanding.  Friendly service with an outstanding menu is the Del  
Rae's hallmark.  The pricing is very reasonable.",1
725,4355,Started with the Teriyaki Tidbits which were tender and delicious. Moved on to Prime Rib and Lobster Thermidor. Prime Rib was HUGE and perfectly cooked. Lobster was succulent and delicious. But the dessert was just WOW! Bananas FlambÃ© = heaven! They make it right in front of you. It's quite the presentation especially when it is lit on fire! Very cool and absolutely delicious!!!,0
726,4356,"My friends and I frequently meet for dinner at Dal Rae where the food is excellent and the service even better.  It's a well established restaurant in Pico Rivera and they are know for their pepper steak and Chilean sea bass.  That said, all the different dishes that we have tried are well-prepared and the meats and fish of fine quality.  They also make a veal Oscar that is very noteworthy.    No matter how crowded the restaurant is, the table service is always excellent.  A good place to go or try if you haven't been there.",0
727,4357,"We gather here as a mid-point restaurant 1-2 times a year.  This year the 2 birthday boys had the prime rib and it was EXCELLENT!  
The one issue that evolved was a major one: a waitress dropped a couple of wine glasses right by our table and glass flew all over the place....with some landing on our table and one of the guests.  Everyone took a very lax attitude to this problem, from management to waitress, that I was very surprised by this.  It wasn't until quite a while later that apologies were noted and some free dessert was offered; I just thought that more would have been done.",1
728,4358,"We were never rushed and the food was near perfection. Our waitress was helpful, courteous, and very efficient! Wine selection was very good and the Grand Marnier Suffle was scrumptious, what a great way to end a superb dinner experience...",0
729,4359,"We go to Dal Rae OFTEN, as it is probably the BEST restaurant in Southern California.  Service 100%  Food 100%  Ambiance 100%.  I eat out 5 out of 7 nights a week and I ALWAYS go back to Dal Rae ! !  You can't beat it ! !",1
730,4360,"We came in 2 short of our reservation party and we were seated within 5 minutes. Everyone is so nice and welcoming.
We were greeted by our waitress Monica and ordered cocktails right away and shortly our relish tray arrived along with bread. We really enjoy the relish tray. Refreshing!
Monica took our order for the evening (Dine LA) and as always the food was amazing! Salad was cold and fresh, dinner was spot on delicious and desert was very good! 
We will return very soon with our daughter. 
Thank you for a wonderful dinner!",0
731,4361,We went as part of the DineLA event and the Dal Rae never disappoints.  I've had their signature pepper steak several times in the past and it's so good it's hard not to order it!  They offered salmon for DineLA so I figured I would try it.  Surprise!  They also do seafood very well!  Our server was outstanding as was the food.  This was an exceent experience al around as has every other time we have been.  I highly recommend the Dal Rae!,0
732,4362,"second time at Dal Rae and once again I was amazed by the owners and managers checking up on my table every so often to make sure I was enjoying my meal. The waitress was busy, but she kept on top of our needs. Also, we arrived ten minutes early, but we were seated right away. Oh, almost forgot, the portions are huge and delicious.",0
733,4363,"Superb dining, a beautiful room, excellent service, what more could a person want?",1
734,4364,"Great food and service as it is supposed to be! From table-side salad service to Steak Diane and the best Prime Rib around! A terrific menu from steak, seafood AND vegetarian!!",0
735,4365,"This long standing establishment is consistently outstanding in every respect.  The food remains wonderful - including the table side Caesar salad preparation which is presently extinct in almost every restaurant to the amazing seafood, beef and veal dishes.  Every aspect was orchestrated to perfection, including the service exhibited by Jacqui.  She is truly an asset and credit to Dal Rae, as she clearly demonstrates the art of courteousness, customer service and attentiveness to the guest.  Be sure to request her on any future visits, as we always do when dining in this landmark restaurant.  Superior in every way, especially in wait service.",0
736,4366,I have been going to the Dal Rae for over 30 years.  Yesterday I ordered the Special Salad and asked to have it tossed with blue cheese dressing.  It came and it was pure blue cheese dressing...couldnt even taste the salad.  Very disapointing.  First  disapointment in all the times I have been there...so I'll give them a pass on this one.,0
737,4367,"My Husband and I dined here for the first time for a date night without the kids.  We enjoyed the food, and our Server China was very friendly and pleasant.  We ordered escargot, scallops and bone in filet mignon.  Everything was absolutely delectable.   The garlic cheese bread came out nice and hot.  Then we ordered chocolate souffle for dessert with vanilla ice cream a la mode.  Yumm!  We are definitely coming back and bringing or Children with us next time.",0
738,4368,"Two weeks ago my husband and I moved to California from Minnesota.  A friend recommended that my husband take me to DalRae for my birthday.  We read reviews online and it sounded very good.  We are self-declared foodies and keep our expectations low when we are going somewhere for the first time.  Well, from start to finish this restaurant was impeccable.  We started with Hendrick's Gin and Tonics while we enjoyed the fresh tray of vegetables and homemade sourdough bread.  We ordered baked brie in a pesto sauce for an appetizer and it was lip-smacking good.  For dinner I ordered the filet medallions in a mushroom and bernaise sauce with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes.  Just writing this makes me salivate!  My filet medallions were cooked to perfection (medium rare) and truly I  didn't need to use a knife to eat this tender meat.  My husband ordered the sea scallops with asparagus and baked potato.  The giant sea scallops were prepared with their house preparation: light breading with garlic lemon butter. Again, they melted in our mouth they were so fresh and good.  The ambience was as expected, a throw-back to the 1950's supper club, but charming and very quiet, light music in the background.  The service was very attentive but not intrusive.  For over two hours we enjoyed, delighted and proclaimed out loud how fabulous each part of the meal was.  The valet parking was a plus and I'm already wondering when we can go back.  Exquisite from start to finish.",0
739,4369,"Service was excellent as always.  When my son's steak was not cooked to his liking, they offered to make him another one, but what he really wanted was the Chilean Sea Bass after tasting mine.  They were more than happy to switch his plate.  It is always a great dining experience at the Dal Rae!!",0
740,4370,Last minute reservation and well worth the visit. Dal Rae never Dissapoints us. Pepper steak delicious and good service too.,0
741,4371,"Steak, fish, potatoes and veggies  but all delicious . The bread basket always works. And my filet mignon stroganoff  was not the Betty Crocker garden variety...and the filet mignon pepper steak is a must! The bar scene is loud and the  disc jokey has personality plus!",0
742,4372,"Went  to celebrate a late Father's Day. Had the Veal Chop...OUTSTANDING! The Dal Rey NEVER dissappoints. Lorin, Barry, Dino, John, Monica and Jesus deliver  eager, warm welcoming service. I mentioned to Lorin that I challenge any of the current popular places to measure up to the the Dal Rey in terms of service, ambiance and food quality. NO CHANCE! NO CHANCW!",0
743,4373,You can't find a better spot for Australian lobster tail and the Steak Diane is prepared table side..,0

746,4376,"There were four of us, including my six year old and the staff was very gracious and accomodating. The food was delicious including dessert., and the ""heavy pour"" from the bartender was well appreciated. No watered down cocktails here!",0
747,4377,Loved the prime rib and Chilean Sea bass...definitely melts in your mouth.,0
748,4378,We always enjoy the Dal Rae- one of the last true dining  establishments with great food and staff. Management is always present - restauranteurs at their finest. I am a Velvet Turtle Manager from the past and I know my stuff- The Dal Rae is a top notch restaurant and I have never experienced a problem . I highly reccommend it.,1
749,4379,"Great food, service, drinks - what's not to like. We love to eat at the Dale Rae and will be back soon.",1
750,4380,Best dinner and overall experience we have had in a long time-a perfect evening,1
751,4381,We've been coming hear now for roughly 50 years and although we've searched far and wide still have not found a better special occasion spot.,1
752,4382,"This place never disappoints. Our favorites are ahi on toast with avocado & Caesar Salad. If we are still hungry we'll split an entrÃ©e. Desserts are fabulous if you have enough room. Like going early, before the crowds hit. Can't miss!  Find your favorite servers!  I'm not sharing mine!",1
753,4383,Went for Mothers day weekend our server was so great! Very Attentive. Food was delicious! Def recommend the Rockefeller oysters  !,0

755,4385,Lobster tail and it's the best,1
756,4386,"Every time we go we have a 5 star experience. I am both happy and sad that it has become so popular, but the crowds of people never dampen the experience. Dal Rae always delivers on food, service, and of course ambiance. One of my favorite spots in LA.",1
757,4387,"Been coming to Dal Rae since the last 1950's and used to eat there (or drink) several times a week when I worked at Northrop and was in town.  l still  have the gold Christmas ornaments of ""Dal Rae""  that used to be given out at Christmas  as proof.  .One of my all time favorite restaurants.",1
758,4388,"Always top notch!! This type of experience is becoming scarce, top of the line dining.",1
759,4389,"Have you ever been to a restaurant and asked the server what's good? Then they reply. ""Everything is good!"" Don't you hate that, when 9.99 times out of 10 it's not true! 
The waiter starts off with one strike against them, because they don't have an opinion, or aren't aware of their own food and don't care!

I've been to Dal Rae many times over of the last 10 years...and it's never disappointed me! This is one of the few places I've been where literally everything I've had on the menu, so far has been at the very least good, and most of the time great!

This 1950s style steakhouse always delivers fantastic quality steaks and fish!
I spent a lot of time thinking about were to take a friend who is the general manager of a quality chain restaurant with very high standards and even he was impressed!

We ordered the Oysters Rockefeller and the crab cakes for starters. Some of the best crab cakes I've had on West Coast. It's full of sweet lump crab, a good crispy exterior and very tasty sauce. The Rockefeller was excellent as well, I could've eaten all six by myself..

We were celebrating, so I had the surf and turf, of a petite filet pepper steak and the Chilean Sea bass ""a la Ben""
The pepper steak was excellent Prime beef cooked perfect ! What can I say about the Sea Bass, if you haven't had it you've truly missed one of the great culinary experiences!
My dinner companions had the sea bass with a piccata sauce, and the veal chop; both reported they thoroughly enjoyed them.
 
Dessert was Cherries Jubilee and Tiramisu which we shared. 
The Cherries Jubilee was good, but not a strong enough brandy flavor, and a little skimpy on the cherries. The tiramisu was one of the best!

The service is excellent, but a little casual for the price point. It was more like something I expect at lunchtime, but overall Dal Rae is a solid 4.5 and many times a 5-star experience.",0
760,4390,We will return.  It is hard to find excellent food with outstanding service.,1
761,4391,I simply forgot how good it was.  We were celebrating a  birthday.  Two of us had the pepper steak and it has to have been the best I have ever had.  I can see why LA Magazine has singled it out as one of the essential tastes of LA.  The guest of honor had the veal picata and raved about how the seasonings were perfect and the veal tender.,0
762,4392,"The food always lives up to the high standard that is expected whendinning here. The Signature Pepper Steak is to die for, but a the Chilean Seabass was beyond beleif. OMG what a taste, melts in your mouth!

Fantastic job Del Rae!",0
763,4393,Great food; server could have been nicer and more personable.,1
764,4394,Hadn't been there in quite a while. A little skeptical with bar re-do and new crowd. Had a great time. The food and the service was as excellent as I remember. (35 year patron) Will return ASAP.,0
765,4395,Ha ha - no view.  But it doesn't matter. .xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,1
766,4396,Dal Rae is a gem. The service is impeccable. The food is to die for. Their table side prepared Caesar Salad is the best I've ever had. Their Prime rib is flavorful and moist. Their Chocolate souffle is Heavenly well worth the 30 minute wait.,0
767,4397,"Dal Rae is a real gem- a blast from the past restaurant straight out of Mad Men. My husband and I went there recently to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. Our dinner was delicious and the service was impeccable. I had the double cut lamb chops which were cooked perfectly. My husband had the surf n turf- filet mignon and Chilean sea bass. He couldn't decide which was better though I was very partial to the filet. We both had garlic mashed potatoes as a side. The restaurant surprised us with a complimentary slice of cake for celebrating our anniversary. We also ordered the flourless chocolate cake dessert which was quite decadent, served with coffee ice cream and creme anglaise.
We hope to come back for our next special occasion. I want to experience the tableside caesar salad!",0
768,4398,Memorable experience.  Great food and service.  Must enjoyable.,1
769,4399,Would have preferred for the background music to be softer...lunch crowd was noisy and coupled with the music it was nearly impossible to visit with my guests....without shouting....,0
770,4400,Celebrating 12 years of marriage with style. As usual the service at the Del Are was excellent. The food was amazing. The Teriyaki Tidbits were like heaven in your mouth. The peppercorn filet mignon and double crusted lamb chops melted in your mouth. Finally the Banana Flambe was an experience worth coming for all by its self. The atmosphere was delightful and I would recommend this place to Antone with taste!,0
771,4401,"Perfect evening!  Our reservation was honored with the special requests we had made & we had the good fortune to have Lydia as our server. She totally made the evening for us with her friendly helpful service. At our table we had the blackened swordfish which as always was fresh, succulent, cooked perfectly & paired with a baked potato & asparagus. Our birthday girl (her 50th) had the strip  Pepper Steak & it came covered with the pepper topping we all crave. Cooked to a perfect medium rare. Vegetable was more than a side dish, the asparagus was cooked al dente & was fresh & tender. Garlic mashed potatoes were by far the best I've had. Fluffy, creamy & garlic infused. Lydia recommended the Prime rib & it did not disappoint. Served medium rare with au jus & a side of excellent horseradish sauce. Definitely a prime cut of beef. Juicy & tender, a portion large enough to require the take home bag. Dessert  was ordered by  only one of us, the rest of us were too full. The creme brulee was a delight & the chocolate cake presented to the birthday girl was delicious & served with 4 forks. I must repeat, perfect evening! Thanks Lydia for making it so.",0
772,4402,Our go to place of a special occasion meal or friends are in town.,1
773,4403,The Dal Rae is so predictably great!  We go there at every possible opportunity knowing the food will be excellent and the service great.  We love the bread basket and relish tray.,1
774,4404,Great as always my wife and I love this place.  The service  was excellent as always. We have been going there for about 3+ years.,1
775,4405,I really like Dal Rae's for its melt in your mouth steak and caesar salad which is mixed at table side. The ambiance is perfect and customer service supreme. It's an instant favorite.,1
776,4406,"This has been our go to place when meeting friends from grad school.  One couple lives in Newport Beach, the other in Clairmont and we  drove from the San Fernando Valley.  This has been the perfect meeting place.

If you like old school steakhouses with traditional menu items like Lobster Thermadour, Steak Diane, and Ceasar Salads still made table side this place is perfect.  The food is plentyful and delicious and the restaurant is always packed.

Make sure you have plenty of time, as they do not rush you.  Food can be slow coming out of the kitchen, but it's worth the wait.  Staff was friendly and attentive, and the owner works the floor, and is happy to add a touch of Dal Ray history if asked.",0
777,4407,"We were on vacation and went to Dal Rae with relatives.  It was amazing food.  The Caesar Salad, a flambÃ© dinner and dessert were made at the table.  It's pricey, but the food is very worth it.  A really great way to end our vacation.",0
778,4408,Excellent food.  Very generous portions.  The Chilean sea bass is amazing .  As is the pepper steak.,0

780,4410,Love this place. Everything was fabulous. Food was excellent.,1
781,4411,"We made a reservation and were seated immediately. Asked for a booth on line and it was waiting for us on a packed Saturday night. As always, Greeted warmly, Water, Bread, and Relish tray were there without asking. We both had the Signature Sea Bass prepared Ala-Ben style entrÃ©e; this is the dish to try on your first visit. Now, If you want meat: The Classic Pepper Steak Filet is amazing. Great table-side Caesar  Salad for two or the Wedge with Dal Rae's Old Fashioned dressing with Blue Cheese crumbles. For Dessert, the Gram Marnier Souffle is wonderful. Enjoy!!",0

First rate service and the food was five star all the way.  Highly recommend for a romantic special occasion.",0
784,4414,"The Dal Rae has again proven to be at the top of the game, providing the two most important qualities for a restraurant: good service and good food. They also have a great selection of wines and desserts. A very happy repeat customer.",0

787,4417,Dal Rae never disappoints.  We had a delicious dinner with attentive service even though the place was packed!    Another nice night.,1
788,4418,"The only problem was waiting for a table.  We were minutes away from leaving.  Had reservations at 7:30pm on Friday night 1/31/15.  Got there at 7:15 and got a buzzer thing.  So we wait standing thinking it wouldnt be long.  But 7:30 passes and nothing.  We see others being seated, sometimes just arriving and being seated immediately (must be regulars or family because the hostess was very friendly with them).  She did not take the time to inform us that our wait would be long or advise us to have a seat at the bar or apologize for the wait.  I think that was important.  A little communication goes a long way.  We were finally seated at 8:15. We were starving and Lydia did take very good care of us.  Had the DineLa menu and will return for the other items.  Maybe not on a busy Friday or earlier.",0
789,4419,As always the service was impeccable and the steaks fantastic.  The Dal Rae is a gem of Los Angeles culinary history and never disappoints.,1
790,4420,"I was invited to lunch at the Dal Rae a couple weeks ago, just brought back my hubby and parents for a special dinner. 
This place is such a gem! The decor is comfy and retro classic. The service (Rose was our server) was outstanding, the food was delicious. 
My dad had the pepper steak and said it was probably the best steak he's ever had. My mom loved the shrimp scampi, my hubby had chicken, and I had salmon which could not have been any fresher, and also was great in a salad the next day! 
However, one of the best things is their timing. They don't rush you from course to course. They are very attentive, refillng drinks, delivering fresh bread, etc. We spent 2-1/2 hours on our dinner and even though they were full to capacity they didn't give the impression that there was anyone but us in the restaurant. Wow. That's just so rare and truly appreciated for a nice night out! 
We were there on a Friday evening and the bar was hopping, very lively friendly upscale crowd.",0
791,4421,"Food was excellent, as always.  Really enjoy their seafood.  Always fresh.  Service was excellent.  Very busy on a Monday night so it was a little noisy but its to be expected.  Overall, great dining experience.  One of my favorite restaurants in the area.",1
792,4422,"We started at the piano bar for a pre-dinner cocktail. The music was wonderful and the artist was very interactive with the guests. When we moved to the table in the main dining room we found it
to be warm and lit perfectly. Everything we ordered was excellent and our server, Michelle, was definitely top-notch. She covered it all. This is definitely a first-class restaurant.",0
793,4423,"This restaurant has been a special occasion choice for years, since the 50's that I know of.  Many of the older residents of Orange and LA counties and adults who went as children have fondly spoken to me of their many family celebrations at this restaurant.  It retains an ambience of quiet graciousness that makes me want to dress up when I go there.  The food is excellent and the service is always a joy.  I would highly recommend it for a quiet anniversary or an adult birthday party.  I have also met friends there to celebrate promotions and retirements.",1
794,4424,Never been disappointed. Food and service always top notch. Dal Rae's prime rib is absolutely the best!!!!,1

The service was fabulous and there was no rush to get us out...we just leisurely enjoyed it all. I may need to celebrate my 6 months b-day just to get back sooner. LOL",0
797,4427,We celebrated 2015 with lunch with friends.  After some initial confusion as to which waitress was serving us (a rare occurrence) our lunch was promptly and efficiently served.  The food is always excellent and the owners are usually there to greet everyone...a very nice touch.  We will be celebrating a Birthday there.  It is great for lunch and dinner. They recently remodeled and it looks great.,0
798,4428,"We arrived on Saturday early evening and were seated immediately.  Our server checked in with us right away, took a drink order, and then the assistant brought bread basket, butter, and garnish plate.  Their flat bread is fantastic.  We had a relaxing pre-dinner conversation and then ordered dinner.  My duck a'la'orange was flambÃ©ed tableside and turned out perfect.  My wife had the Chilean sea bass which is always terrific.  Our server brought us a basket of their signature garlic bread.  Both of us took a portion of our dinner home, as the portions are generous.  As a result, we did not partake in dessert.  It was a very pleasant experience.",0

802,4432,Had a wonderful time at Dal Rae's. Great food and very good service.,1
803,4433,"Everything about this incredible institution is noteworthy.  The food remains consistently the very best now for a number of years.  The lamb chops were cooked to perfection; the Caesar salad - prepared table side is the very, very best; the calamari - nicely prepared.  Cappuccinos - nicely created.  Best of all, our wait person, Catrina was absolutely, positively amazing.  When dining here, be sure to ask for her - every whim, need, want and dining desire is fulfilled.  Water topped off, dishes taken away and every nuisance and request was addressed.  Dining is all about the food, but sometimes it's the service, it's the kindness shown and displayed by the staff that puts it in the stratosphere.

We are happy to give the Dal Rae our highest recommendation and we are looking forward to sharing this outstanding dining experience with our friends.",0
818,4448,"Our anniversary dining adventure began with the Rock Shrimp appetizer. What a dish! It is the best anywhere. Both of us order the filet mignon pepper steaks. I also ordered a side dish of bordelaise sauce for mine. These legendary  steaks were prepared perfectly. The Dal Rae is certainly the only steak house I think of when I want to celebrate with steak. They do it right. It doesn't get any better than here. And their pepper steaks cannot be equaled anywhere. The price for last night was about $130. For us, that's a high price. But we were celebrating. This is the only place I would consider spending that much. And that's without wine. I heartily recommend this 1950's dÃ©cor treasure.",0
819,4449,"Dal Rae has been our special place for over 14 years. We have celebrated anniversaries, birthdays and many other great with Dal Rae and are never let down. The food is incredible.

822,4452,"We have been coming here for 30 years and have never been disappointed.  The food is consistently good, the ambience old-school/classic.  It is quiet and great for a business luncheon.  The service is always spot-on and unobtrusive.  
The only thing we miss is the relish tray!",0
823,4453,"I was impressed by the elegant ambience of the restaurant.  The service was outstanding all night long.  The food was exquisite, like I haven't had in a long time.  The presentation was very artistic worthy of a Four Star Michelin. My compliments to the chef and entire staff.  Fenomenal restaurant worthy of special occasions",1
824,4454,I love this place. Consistently excellent food and amazing service in a great ambiance. I can't tell you how pleasant it is to dine somewhere and have such excellent service. Try the pepper steak which they are know for or the sea bass ala Ben but you can't go wrong. Table side prepared caesar salad and bananas flambe are also just delicious. The singer in the piano bar area is also quite nice. If you haven't bee here you should go visit this hidden gem in Pico Rivera.,0
825,4455,This place is in the worst neighborhood in the city Pico Rivera. Once you drive your can on to the lot you get this feeling like your not in Pico anymore. Valet greets you and experience begins. Once inside your treated to a throwback to the 50's wood dÃ©cor. Old but very well kept. Servers and wait staff are at your service. Pepper Steak was my meal and didn't disappoint. I brought my Wife here for our anniversary and rate this place very high against your chain steak houses. My suggestion is always try for yourself.,1
826,4456,We aren't talking contemporary here- think mid century modern with a menu to go with it. I LOVE THE CRUDITE PLATE!! You won't go away hungry and offerings for every budget and taste.  A rep back to the 1960's in service and food.,0
827,4457,This is a gem of a restaurant with terrific food.,1

831,4461,"We enjoyed our dinner, as usual our Dal Rae pepper steak was cooked to perfection and the shrimp scampy was so good we had seconds.  We took our friends with us and they were amazed at what a great place the Dal Rae was and how you don't find restaraunts like this anymore anywhere.",0

The service and cuisine was exceptional, as always....and we will look forward to returning to the Dal Rae soon!",1
836,4466,"I started going to the Dal Rae with my parents, in my early years.  I have been going now for 40+ years.  When I think about what a restaurant should be, this is what comes to mind.  Family owned.  Consistently good.  A grand dining experience in every respect.  Only place I go where truly EVERYTHING on the menu is awesome!  I live in Orange County and come from afar to get there, but it is well worth it.  If the Dal Rae were on the moon, I would become an astronaut so I could go!  It is out of this world!",1
837,4467,"I've been coming to the Dal Rae since 1983.  The service and food is always top notch!  Great for a business lunch, but also great for an evening dinner too.",1
838,4468,"Great food as always.  All those working there seem to love their jobs and are quite friendly and helpful.  Caesar salads were done at the table to perfection.  One person in our party had the Sand Dabs, hardly seen on the west coast, prepared with a light breading and very tasty.  The other two people in our party had fried shrimp and shrimp scampi.  All three were delicious.  Atmosphere is old world elegant.  The menu is very extensive.  We will be back!",0
839,4469,"Dal Rae kind of feels out of place in this neighborhood, but don't let that fool you.  This place knows how to cook steak!  In fact, they know how to cook period!  Everything we ordered from the steaks to osso buco to the souffle was done to perfection, even all the side dishes.  Complements to the Chef!",0

842,4472,"If Sinatra would have walked in he'd have felt right at home.  This place is very old school classy.  The Dal Rae fish was THE BEST.  Service is extraordinary, and the live music in the lounge suitable to the decor.  Dal Rae is class without the stuffiness.  I took a business client but it's just as good with a special someone for an occasion.  No kids here.  This is an adult restaurant.",0
843,4473,Always enjoy dinner at the Dal Rae. Been going there for years! Great food and wonderful service.,1
844,4474,"This restaurant was a favorite years ago when I worked in the area.
When a friend suggested dinner somewhere close to both of us, I thought of Dal Rae! Even though it had been years I trusted the recent rating from Open Table and made the reservation. We were not disappointed! Food and service were excellent!! I suggest the fresh Caesar salad prepared at your table. Given the opportunity I will be back whenever possible.",0
845,4475,Dal Rae offers very good food and the service is exceptional.  I try to take my most important clients and my senior managers to Dal Rae because of the great steaks and portions that are fit for a king.  I will difinitely be coming back for more.,0

848,4478,"Everything was delicious, except our steak was a little bit over cooked. other that we had a good dinner, celebrating a birthday..",1
849,4479,"Like my Aunt always said look for a man with a great pickle! This is the first restaurant in 35 years that I have gone to that actually has a relish dish. No folks it's not for pickle relish. For those of you not born or related to Iowan's this is a dish of radishes, pickles, celery and carrots. The good stuff Grandma would have pulled from her garden then topped with beautiful dill pickle slices that are so mellow you ask the owner for some to take home. I asked, ""how does a girl like me, get some of those great pickles to go? He told me all you have to do is ask. I did, and they sent me home with a box of them. Ah yes, and all the food we ate, was fantastic! What more could a girl ask for? Lots of left overs. Patricia Lardy",0

853,4483,I love taking my wife here cause she absolutely loves the food.,1
854,4484,"We had to increase the size of our party from 4 to 5 upon arrival.  The staff was most accommodating and accomplished that in the space of five minutes.  The food was excellent and the service superb.  We were seated in a section of the restaurant that had just reopened after refurbishment, so it didn't have quite the atmosphere that we have enjoyed in the past here.  Also, the air conditioning needed some adjustment as it was blasting on us.  The wait staff went out of their way to make the evening particularly enjoyable.",0
855,4485,"Excellent food and service!! From my dining experience, it wasn't surprising to see why most of the people dining there were regulars, I think I just turned into one too.",1

We highly recommend this restaurant",1

863,4493,"This is one of the only resturants left that still provide a great expeience in dinning out for dinner. Many of the old resturants have closed, due to redevelopement, or other reasons, but Dal Rae not only serves the finest food, but the service and ambience is second to no other. The menu is so diverse, andI cannot wait to get back, just to try something else on the menu.",0
864,4494,"Has been here forever and deserves to be.  Great, friendly staff.  Classic old school menu prepared well.",1
865,4495,"Dal Rae is the restaurant equivalent of a time machine.  It would be totally at home in the 50's or 60's; nevertheless, it is fresh and inviting today.  The food and service are both top notch.  The place was packed on a Saturday night which I understand to be normal.  Be sure to make a reservation.  While it may be a bit out of the way, Dal Rae is well worth the trip.",0
866,4496,"This restaurant is old school ""Rat Pack"" era with all first class faire for your meals.  Steak and Fish are cooked to perfection along with a special occasion Grand Marnier soufflÃ© as the crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me for a night cap. 
Groovy baby groovy was to night.",1
867,4497,"Perfect dining experience. Great service, atmosphere, and the food was just delicious. We started with crab cakes and the rock shrimp.

I had the sea bass and it was prepared perfectly. No room for dessert this time!",0

The steak here never disappoints.   I brought clients from out of town - they were amazed at the quality of the food.
I need to come back more often ...",0
870,4500,"This is a really good restaurant, always busy.  The steaks are a 10 plus and the dessert- a chocolate concoction was fantastic.  But the Cesar salad made at the table was over dressed and the server could have been a bit more attentive even though she was probably very busy.",0
871,4501,This restaurant always has excellent food and service. They have an extensive fish selection prepared in several ways and the BEST prime rib!,1

879,4509,"We had Steak Diane and it was delicious. I could have made a meal on the relish tray, the freshly baked bread and the warm garlic bread.

881,4511,"Always great to return to Dal Rae.  Never disappoints.  It was unbelievable to see the restaurant crowded on a Sunday night.  Almost every table was taken, even the banquet rooms were occupied.  Dal Rae knows how to treat their customers with great care, service and fabulous food.  For this reason, they have no problem in having a thriving business.  My husband was a happy camper with their Hearts of Romaine salad to start off the meal.  As usual, he ordered the Alaskan King Crab Legs.  I ordered the Swordfish with the Alla Ben sauce.  We have dinner there for special occasions, and occasionally have a late lunch during the week.",0
882,4512,"Expensive but worth every penny.  Osso Buco - fantastic; steak tartar - wonderful;  liver and onions - perfect;  pepper steak - delish.  Have never had anything but the most delicious food here.  Drinks are great, too.  Fantastic service on top of everything else.",0

I love steakhouses, specifically old school steakhouses. Taylor's in Koreatown is a favorite and now, for sure, Dal Rae is. 

Best baked potato I've ever had. Next time I will ask to sit in the piano bar, where there are dinner tables. Martini was excellent. 

GM (I think he was) very cool guy from West LA like me.

Thanks Dal Rae!",1

888,4518,"Dal Rae has been one of my very favorite restaurants for many years.  My girlfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday.  We were seated as soon as we arrived in one of their large, comfortable booths.  Our server, Michelle, was terrific.  She was pleasant, upbeat, informative, funny and very attentive - a true professional, and the kind of server one would expect at a very nice restaurant.  I ordered the ""surf and turf.""  The pepper steak was excellent as always, but the Chilean sea bass was a wonderful surprise.  I expected it to be good, but it was far better than that.  It was cooked to perfection and very tasty.  The chocolate covered strawberries infused with Grand Marinier were a nice, refreshing way to end the meal.",0

Love the Cesar salad prepared table side, the deli tray is the trademark of the Dal Rae.  I've been to the Dal Rae about 6 times, and I've ordered the Peppered Filet Mignon every time... it's that good.  The bartenders have a heavy hand, so if you're looking for a stiff drink, this is your spot.  Best time to try out the Dal Rae is during LA Restaurant Week, it's usually crowded but worth it.",0
910,4540,I have been going to th Dal Rae for many years and I have always found their food consistently wonderful. The service has always been perfect along with being very helpful when discussing the menu. I would say the Dal Rae is like the old dinner house of the past but yet modern in every other way. I will be going back soon.,1
911,4541,"This place is awesome, and is a perfect place to meet friends from Orange County and Los Angeles (it's about a 45 minute drive).  I was introduced to this place a few years ago, but my 82 year old father knew of it from the ""old days.""  If you're looking for classic steak house food, good portions at a reasonable price (it's not cheap, but relative to Maestro's or some other place it's a bargain and you will not feel cheated).  If you're old enough to remember Chasen's and Scandia you'll love this place.  My wife and I had the filet mignon which was cooked perfectly and our friends shared the rack of lamb that they loved.",0
912,4542,"Came here for a business/social dinner after staying away after our last,âless than anticipatedâ experience.  We must have just hit Dal Rae on an off night, because they knocked it out of the park on this trip.  The drinks are poured old school.

I just wish you all were closer to Huntington Beach, but we now have a new favorite.  Well done folks!",0

915,4545,"I've been coming here since I was a kid. It is so nice to know that some things never change. This is truly a classic dining experience. We started with Martinis in the bar. At the table we had the escargot. My girlfriend never had them and agreed it was one of the best things she ever ate. Then we cleansed our palates with the chilled crab claws. So delicious. Then we split the ceasar salad, made table side. Another great compliment to the meal. After that we split the Filet Mignon. Every bite was amazing. Take it from me, finish the meal with the Bananas Foster, again made table side. Unforgettable.",1

The booth was so comfortable. I wish this restaurant was in MY neighborhood as it takes a very long and crowded freeway drive for me to get there.,0
918,4548,"This restaurant was a great find and I am very glad that we found it. Im only sad I did not find it earlier. Go, Have a great time and enjoy you're self.",1

Love the crowd.",1
922,4552,Great food and friendly service.,1
923,4553,"Took a good customer there for lunch, he was so happy with service, food, ambiance that he started suggesting more items we should sell him. While we were there two friends came in with separate parties got to say hello. Definitely a good place for entertaining.",0
924,4554,"I loved the leather booths and the rich wood walls- but most of all the food. We had a party of five and each one of us loved our dishes. The Caesar Salad, made from scratch, was one of the best I have had in years. The couple that shared the Steak Diane said it was one of the best ever. My Pepper Steak was delicious, cooked to perfection, and I ate everything to the last bite. Ger's- Osso Bucco was tender with a flavorful sauce and he couldn't stop raving about it. They don't make restaurants like this anymore. I wish it was closer to home. but well worth the one and half hour drive.",0
925,4555,"Went here for my husband's birthday. I was hesitant at 1st because of its location but it turned out really nice. The prime rib was amazing and the portion was bigger than I expected. My husband really liked his prime rib, juicy and tender. My son ordered frog legs and was surprised that there were 4 legs on his plate. We ordered the cherries jubilee for dessert which they prepare table side which was a nice show and provided a complimentary Birthday dessert for my husband and sang "" Happy Birthday"". We left stuffed considering they give you complimentary bread and relish dish.",0
926,4556,"My husband and I went to Dal Rae for Valentine's Day, and had such a wonderful time that we returned for our anniversary a month later. A rare gem with tableside preparation. Their signature pepper fillet is huge and melts in your mouth. I would recommend any of the tableside prepared dishes, espeically the Cesaer salad and Bananas Flambed. The bananas dish is different than Bananas Foster as they prepare a caramel tableside and it hardens over the ice cream. It may be one of the best desserts I have ever had. And then there's the Cesaer- Yum! I cannot say enough about the service. You wait for nothing, yet they are not intrusive-just friendly and attentive. Finish off your evening with a night cap at the piano bar in the lounge.",0
927,4557,"We had a lovely birthday celebration lunch at the Dal Rae......the cuisine was outstanding, as always, and the service was impeccable......highly recommended!",0

930,4560,"Tucked away on Washington Boulevard this gem serves the best Caesar salad north of the border. We've been several times and have never left disappointed nor had a meal not fit for a king. Ambiance is nice, leaving you feel as if Sinatra, Martin, Davis should be sitting in the booth next to you.",0
931,4561,We enjoyed the relaxed feel of this place comfortable seats and ease of communicating with each other without the noise usually found in other restaurant. Food was cooked to our taste. Will be coming back with other friends.,0
932,4562,"Old school steak house. Dark wood and comfortable booths. We got a table. Crowded that night so loud. Four other tables next to us also celebrating b-days. Order the Washington Apple martini. Known for the steaks, so one person ordered chicken. Started with the wilted spinach salad, enough for 4 people. Chicken person didn't like the meal due to the sauce. 3 others got steak, mmmmmmmmm good. If you go, MUST order Grand Marnier Souffle for dessert. Decadence in a white pot.",0
933,4563,"The Del Rae is a true gem. After so many years in business it still has the same charm, great food, great service and the best piano bar in town! We will definitely be back and recommend this restaurant to everyone!",1
934,4564,"Coming to Dal Rae is like stepping out of the hustle-bustle world we live in and stepping back to a calmer, 3 martini lunch kind of world. The atmosphere is fantastic, top notch service and many patrons are greeted by name. The food is just as wonderful, had the filet and the hubs had swordfish. Both were thick, hearty portions of perfectly flavored protein. The mashed potatoes were fluffy and delightful, the asparagus was the right mix of cooked but still crunchy...too bad we were too full for dessert! What a gem this place is!",0
935,4565,The quality and consistency of the food and experience at the Dal Rae make for a wonderful evening every time.,1
936,4566,"It never changes, it's always a nice place to take friends",1
937,4567,This was my 2nd time here. My parents and grandparents use to come years and years ago together. My Mother is the only one left that is alive and we brought her here for her 83rd Birthday. Everything was as she remembered it and brought back many good memories. The service and food was excellent. My husband brought me here for our first wedding anniversary last New Years Eve. It was just as good that night as well!,0
938,4568,The service was very good. The food was even better. I recommend this to all my friends.,1
939,4569,"I had only been here once before and I must say, the experience gets better each time. We were dining for a sisters night out, celebrating a birthday and everything was great. The wait was minimal and we did not mind at all as the bar is welcoming and the service was great. The patio area is so nice and relaxing. The dining room was busy, but we were never waiting for anything. The food was FANTASTIC and we ordered a lot. I cannot say enough about how great this dining experience was. I will definitely be back.",0
940,4570,"This blast from the past is a welcome pleasure. Owner works the floor most every night taking care of guest and managing the store. I think the selection of menu items, corresponding prices and quality of food is a great value. Often it seems I pay more for less in at other establishments. Give Dal Rae a try I'm certain you will not be disappointed.",0
941,4571,"I have been at Dal Rae many times. Always a pleasure with great food and wonderful service. We were celebrating a belated Valentine's Day with a couple of friends. The restaurant was quite full for a weekday lunch so I believe others are of the same opinion that Dal Rae is an exceptional restaurant. The restaurant does not serve free garlic bread during lunch, but does during dinner. If you are there for lunch, be sure to order the garlic bread.",0

950,4580,This was my first time going and I will look forward to returning. excellent service our server was very attentive. .,1
951,4581,"Fantastic lunch of crab Louie (real crab with NO shell and real Louie dressing). Rose, our waitress, was helpful with explaining things and caught the bartender's mistake of pouring a vodak instead of gin bloody Mary. She and the bus staff were very attentive without bothering us so that we could enjoy our lunch. They had been closed to refurbish AND they did it without spoiling the wonderful vive that makes Dal Rae so special. Thanks you for a wonderful meal and can't wait to return.",0
952,4582,"I have been going to the Dal Rae for years, it is a wonderful place to take friends and family for special occasions and sometime just for a drink and appetizers. Loren who is one of the owners is always there to greet you.",1

The chef cooked my steak well done and full of flavor I could eat here every night, the shrimp scampy is amazing with their garlic butter sauce I could eat two orders. I had flowers delivered to the Resturaunt for our 17th anniversary (3rd anniversary in a row we celebrated there). I had a booth reserved for us and they had the flowers their ready to go and made the evening special. I can't complain about the food not one bit, as our pallet is addicted to their food!! They could probably get away with charging me triple as I would gladly pay! Thank you again Dal Rae!",0
955,4585,Food was great and staff was very attentive!,1
956,4586,The service and food at this long time icon is consistently excellent.,1
957,4587,WE HAVE BEEN DINING AT THE DAL RAE FOR MORE THAN 50 YEARS. WE GO WHEN WE FEEL LIKE THE DRIVE OR JUST CRAVE THE LOBSTER THERMODORE.,1
958,4588,The dinner was amazing and the service was excellent. We were seated right away and were seated close enough to the music.,1
959,4589,"This is my third time having dinner at Dal Rae. I was impressed again. The server was polite and personable, the bar tender was friendly, and the food was perfect. This is a great place to go if you love steak and seafood. I will definitely visit them again. It was a pleasurable experience.",1
960,4590,"This place has been at this location since 1958, that tells you something. They make the best steak, period!",1
961,4591,"Went to Dal Rae during Dine LA and had a great dinner. The food and service were excellent. It had been about two years since I had last been there, and it was just as great as I had remembered. My steak was tender and flavorful, and the Caesar salad made tableside really stood out! I hightly recommend this restaurant.",0
962,4592,"As usual the service is impeccable from the parking
attendants to our server. Monte Cristo
Sandwich is another hit!",1
963,4593,"Great steak great cocktails and great atmosphere
The only reason they were a little slow is because they were a little understaffed
None the less great place for a fancy dinner.",0

966,4596,The food and service were outstanding.,1
967,4597,"I'd come back here in a second. Went for DineLA 2014. Welcome was nice. Food was delicious, bus boys were friendly, our waitress was indifferent yet efficient. Tried to be friendly with our server, we were just a number to her - so I gave a rating of 3 stars (good). Everything else def 5 stars. Love the old school kinda vibe you get here. Also, please dress business casual if possible as that is what is requested, At dinner service we saw someone in shorts. Wtf buddy?!",0
968,4598,The food was delicious! We had the DineLA preset menu and it was a ton of food. It did take a while for the food to come out but we appreciated that the wait gave us time to digest one course and be ready for the next. The crab stuffed mushrooms were amazing. The quality of the crab meat made them so good. I've had stuffed mushrooms before at other seafood restaurants but this was the read deal. Real crab was used and that gave the stuffed mushrooms a great flavor. The other great part of the meal was the garlic mashed potatoes. I enjoyed every bite of them! I tried something new this time at the Dal Rae and I was not disappointed. I highly recommend the veal!! And as always I love the heavy hand pour from the bar!,0
969,4599,Seated us right away and took our drink orders.The food took time but was worth the wait.Well never see dessert the same after their banana flambe =),1
970,4600,"This neighborhood gem is stylish and vintage all at the same time. The food is delicious and it gives off the Mad Men feel of the 50s and 60s. It's classy and romantic. However, valet is required, and though it's not much, it's an unexpected cost. The bathroom was being remodeled but I was assured the inconvenience of a temporary bathroom would be overwith in a day. Overall I loved it.",1
971,4601,Dal Rae is an excellent restaurant. At this time it is undergoing renovations so it isn't up to its usual ambience standard but I am sure it will be lovely when it is done. Food and service still excellent.,0
972,4602,"This venerable restaurant never disappoints. Always busy for a reason. Not inexpensive but the quality is worth the price. We usually go for lunch but because of a birthday a dinner was most appropriate. 4 different groups were also celebrating birthdays while we were dining, so I guess this is a special occasion restaurant. Everything we have ever ordered here has been delicious, so even though we have a few good restaurants closer to us we make the hour + drive once a month.",0
973,4603,"The Dal Rae has earned its exceptional reputation over the many years serving discriminating eaters. AND, it is almost the only place to get a perfect souffle. They cater to the individual diner and the chef prepares each dish to please the pallet and eye. The only negative at all is the noise level and you cannot escape that anywhere you go. I love the Dal Rae.",0
974,4604,"I GREW UP IN THE AREA AND HAVE DRIVEN PAST THE DAL RAE ON NUMEROUS OCCASSIONS. I HEARD THRU FRIENDS THAT THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT. THE WIFEY'S PARENTS WENT THERE BACK IN THE DAY AND THEY LOVED IT. SO FOR OUR FIRST ANNIVERSARY I TOOK THE WIFEY AND SHE LOVED IT, I LOVED IT! RAN INTO SOME PEOPLE I KNEW, THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT! WE ARE DEFINATELY GOING BACK!",1
975,4605,"Wonderful food and great dÃ©cor. A great holiday or special lunch place. Great for romantic or business lunch. Food is great, service very attentive. Recommend later lunch for more intimate feel.",0
976,4606,"This is a classy, older-style restaurant that we like to go to for special occasions (due to the expense, otherwise we would go more frequently!). The pepper steak is outstanding, the martinis are excellent and we have found the service knowledgeable, friendly and efficient. I recommend ordering both the Grand Marnier and the chocolate dessert souffles--they are delicious together. Parking is only valet, with a $3.50 service charge. That adds to the ""specialness"" of the outing for me.",0
977,4607,This restaurant is one of the last establishments from a fabulous era- Great ambiance- food- service- one of the best!!,1
978,4608,Great high quality food well prepared and gracious service. And nice people in management and on the wait staff to boot. You can't do any better for a special occasion than this fine restaurant.,0
979,4609,"Our tradtional Christmas Eve dinner at Dal Rae was wonderful. We have been coming for many years and it has always been a wonderful, special, delicious dinner and evening. First of all, the staff and servers are so wonderful, they make everyone feel special. Next, the food is spectacular............never been disappointed yet! The Seafood Platter is beautifully displayed with fresh oysters, shrimp, Ahi tuna, crab. A favorite dish is the Chilean Seabass which is cooked to perfection. Needless to say, we will continue our Christmas Eve tradition, we know it will alway be special.",0
980,4610,"My party of 3 enjoyed our annual Christmas lunch at Dal Rae, as usual the service and food were excellent. This year using Open Table we were seated immediately upon arrival, literally went from our car to our table no waiting. Awesome!! The Sea Bass & Filet were incredible as usual.",0
981,4611,"We love the old charm of the Dal Rae, including the relish tray served when you are 1st seated. Our table raved over the fresh bread as well as the garlic toast. The Chilean sea bass was outstanding, as was the whole lobster tail. The service was perfect, not hurried & very friendly.",0
982,4612,Our experience at the Dal Rae was nothing less than awesome. From the moment you arrive you are treated wonderfully. The food is as always the best. The spinach salad and lobster thermidor were the best!!!,1
983,4613,I love this place - one of my favorite old school places,1
984,4614,"Went to Dal Rae with a friend for our annual December blow-out. The food was wonderful; iceberg salads, oysters, pepper steak and prime rib. The prime rib was better than Lawry's, buttery and slightly salty with a mild, creamy horseradish. The menu, reminiscent of 1968, is fabulous. This must be the last place in Los Angeles that serves lobster Thermidor. Probably the best thing about Dal Rae, after the great food and excellent, attentive service, is the clientele. This is the real Los Angeles, people who work hard and then go out for a great meal to celebrate, as opposed to Westside pretention. This is the best restaurant in the greater L.A. area- go there and discover it for yourself.",0
985,4615,"We have been coming to Del Rae's for over ten years to celebrate our anniversary and birthday. One of the things we look forward to most is being waited on by Monica and seeing some of the staff members that have been at Del Rae's for many, many years. We exchange stories about our growing families and Monica treats us like we were extra special customers. We always have the prime rib and no other steakhouse has ever been able to compare to the quality and taste.

During the Christmas season, the restaurant is decorated to the tens in lights and beautiful floral arrangements. It really gives you the feeling of Christmas. Thank you again, Del Rae's and we hope to be enjoying your restaurant for at least another ten years!!!",1
986,4616,Food is always great and service as well. Decorations beautiful to put you in the holiday mood.,1
987,4617,"I have been coming to the Dal Rae for about 9 years now and it never disappoints! The food is always cooked to perfection and the service is impeccable! The holidays are a great time to visit the restaurant as it is decorated so beautifully for Christmas! Twinkle lights and gorgeous decor everywhere! It is so beautiful. The perfect spot for a holiday gathering! They have a limited menu during the month of December so I tried the poor mans pepper steak lunch. Huge well seasoned ground beef steak, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Absolutely delicious and way too much for one person to eat. They get 5 stars from me for the consistency in serving amazing food and service that is second to none!",0
988,4618,"Dal Raes Pepper Steak is flavor full and their crab cakes just melt in your mouth. The service is great. We arrived early with a reservation, almost 45 minutes and they sat us right away.",0
989,4619,"Dal Rae was over the top--great bar and attentive bartenders, wonderful waitress and busboys, highly decorated for the season, and best of all, fantastic food. The prime rib was a large portion cooked exactly as asked-It couldn't have been better. The veal was fork tender. Can't wait to go back!!",0

993,4623,"It was our 30th anniversary. We had always heard this place was really good. That was an understatement. We were seated as soon as we walked in. Our waitress (Michelle was her name, I think) was so polite and friendly, and very attentive. The relish tray and bread were a great start. I had the pepper steak, my wife had the duck. Both were delicous. For dessert, the chocoalte souffle was awesome. This place will be a place I go back to for special occasions often. I really liked the Christmas decorations too ! I actually could not find anything I didn't like, and I tend to be a bit picky.",0
994,4624,Dal Rae is the best! Always consistent in food and service! My very favorite place!,1
995,4625,Excellent food and service! Food prepared as requested and served hot.,1

998,4628,Dal Rae Rest is so nice it puts most other restaurants to shame. The Service is exemplory and the food is the BEST. It is a great place to take a loved one or a Foody.,1
999,4629,"The Dal Rae has been around for decades and still maintains its old school roots while keeping contemporary. This is the place to get lost favorites like lobster thermador and classic favorites like filet mignom. I save this restaraunt for special occassions since it is not just a meal but an experience in how dining used to be. The wait staff are friendly and experienced and the manager checks on each table, not because he is told to, but because he is genuinely interested.",0
1000,4630,"The Dal Rae has long been noted for their pepper steak, which is a unique assemblage of peppers, green onions slightly grilled in the juice of the steak. Delicious in its own right. But, in recent years I've found that their aging of the steak, for me it is always the New York strip steak, has made it a complete delight in and of itself with the special taste of the New York strip together with the buttery texture of the filet mignon. My wife had the shrimp scampi and compared it in quality with the same dish at the Hungry Tiger Restaurant of years past, which is rare praise indeed. All in all, a memorable experience and one we'll look forward to repeating soon.",0
1001,4631,"If you love superb, tender and flavorful steaks, this is where you will find some of the best. My petite filet mignon was a nice, generous size and one of the most tender filets I have ever had anywhere. My friend ordered the rib eye. She has dined at the best restaurants all over the world and said her rib eye was ""exceptional"". All the side were excellent, as well as the desserts. A wonderful dining experience!",0
1002,4632,Great dinner and service. The food was excellent. I like the way they cater to you. Would definitely come back again.,1
1003,4633,"This is an absolutely wonderful restaurant for special occasions, lunch or dinner. The menu is extensive and everything is prepared to perfection.

1009,4639,"We had a most enjoyable evening at the restaurant and would definitely recommend the place to all our friends. Our meat were slightly overcooked; however, was still delicious. Both the rack of lamb & prime rib is a must try. Our waiter, John is outstanding and truly deserves the best waiter award.",0
1010,4640,Wonderful as always. 55 years of practice has made for a perfect evening. Restaurant itself is a step back in time with outstanding current vibs. Warm hostesses and bartenders. Drinks were not a short pour. Wait staff who are knowledgeable and attentive. They anticipate without being in your face. We split the house salad. Then we had their anniversary special prime roast beef which melted in our mouths. It was served with baked potatoes (our choice) and asparagas. Wine list was reasonable with many choices. Can't wait to return!!!,0
1011,4641,"We had another outstanding dinner. First time for Dal Rae Prime Rib and it was delicious. Great service, will be back very soon.",0

1018,4648,We try to attend this event every year. Plus we go there irregularly regular. It was a much older crowd than were used to because we usually roll in around 8:30PM. Our reservation was 6:00PM and we were sat right away and food came promptly. And it was very good.,1

1022,4652,"A great place for our anniversary. Quiet, dark ambience with 5 star service and food quality. Well worth the expense",0
1023,4653,"Our food especially my pepper steak was outstanding. Old style food that's hard to find now, like Lobster Thermador. Awesome meal!",0
1024,4654,"I grew up hearing grown ups talk about ""the Dal Rae"" in reverent terms....for example ""it was our anniversary, so of course, we went to the Dal Rae""....the response was always ""well of course, good choice"". So, I knew that I would enjoy it once I became an adult but it is even better than I expected. The Dal Rae is like the person that you meet that you know has gobs and gobs of money but doesn't ""need"" to show it off. The service was attentive but not annoyingly so, the food was delicious! but not so sophisticated that I had to ask what it was made of and the ambiance....understated elegance. The Best!",1
1025,4655,We come to Del Rae on special occasions to treat ourselves to the prime rib. It literally melts in your mouth. We get the regular cut so we can have enough leftovers to enjoy it the next night. Even our puppies get a taste of the good life. We hope that Del Rae will be here for many years to come.,1
1026,4656,The Dal Rae is the best! Richard makes everyone feel welcome and does a terrific job of table-side specialties. Even the parking attendants are the best! Wonderful food; terrific service; all round great place!,1
1027,4657,"Dal Rae is one of the few restaurants that is from a bygone era , still serving Caesar salad made tableside , lobster Thermidor and chateaubriand you get the picture. Service is friendly treat you like family . I had the Dover sole a classic pan fired lightly breaded with a soft butter sauce"" outrageous"" . The crowd is all age groups from 12 to 100 . The restaurant is a classic 1950 Googie style architecture both in and out could use some remodeling as it is getting old . As I live in century city I always look forward to going to this gem in Pico Rivera its worth the 25min drive for a special occasion .",0
1028,4658,"Excellent food, excellent service, and consistent. This is what the Del Rae is. The part owner and host, Lauren makes you feel like family. Our waitress, Jennifer was outstanding. The Steak Dianne was the best I have ever had. Fresh fish is always available. The menu offers many outstanding entrees, and It has a great bar. We have been frequenting this establishment for the past 30 plus years. If you have never tried it, you are missing something that one should not miss.",0
1029,4659,"Outstanding!!! The Seabass absolutely melts in your mouth. The Shrimp scampi was done to perfection as were the Scallops. The filet mignon was so tender you could cut it with a fork! The frog legs were very tasty as well. The wine selection is very resonable and large. Also must recommend the garlic mashed potatoes and the garlic bread, both excellent.",1
1030,4660,I've had the privilege of coming here for 45 years. Thanks for helping me celebrate my 53rd birthday.,1

I have the sea bass and it was wonderful as was my co diners filet minon. The wine by the glass menu included Far Niente Chardonnay! So nice to have that option. Over all I had a wonderful experience.,0
1032,4662,"Dal Rae, excellent as always. This time, our server, Michlle was particularly noteworthy. She was a true service professional. My wife and daughter cannot have gluten. Michelle was knowledgeable and worked with the kitchen staff to ensure that the food and various ingredients complied ith their needs. Really terrific to experience in this era of sub standard service at so many establishments. We are real fans of this old reliable establishment,",0
1033,4663,"Quite simply, one of the best restuarants in Los Angeles. It is encouraging to see this kind of old school fine dining has not dissapeared from our city.",0
1034,4664,"Yes, it's pricey but for good reason. Everything is top-notch. The food is the highest quality you will find anywhere. Drive to Beverly Hills or Pasadena, but you'll pay for the neighborhood. Here you pay for quality, service and ambiance. No attitudes here. They are happy to serve you and make sure you are 100% satisfied. As a side note: I've never had a bigger or better lobster tail anywhere at any price. And I've only ordered the small one! The large one is twice the size of the small, so you can imagine how enormous it is. There is nothing on their menu that isn't superb and our waitress Lydia was on it. She didn't skip a beat and made sure we had everything we needed. Perfect!",0
1035,4665,My friends and I have gone to this restaurant over the past 10 years. I come from out of state (sometimes out of country) and I find this restaurant to be one of the best I've gone to.,1
1036,4666,Always a treat going to Dal Rae.,1
1037,4667,"We usually request Carrie as our server because she does such an exceptional job but the entire staff from the valets to the busboys are very nice. This time we also had the pleasure of meeting and visiting with one of the partners, Lorin. All the food here is outstanding--the relish tray, the bread, the salads prepared tableside, the peppercorn steak, the sea bass, and for dessert we highly recommend the cherries jubilee also done tableside. We haven't had the lobster yet but it looks fantastic. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They also have an extensive drink and wine list. The wine is a little pricy but what restaurant wine isn't these days.",0
1038,4668,Dal Rae is always a pleasure on a special occasion. It never fails to be a wonderful experience. The steaks melt in our mouth. The service is so very respectful. Everything is always perfect! No wonder so many people enjoy anniversaries and birthdays there!,1
1039,4669,"The Dal Rae has been a high end full service elegant restaurant for over 50 years. When we arrived, the first thing you notice is the really cool front door and fancy handle.. very high end. We started with drinks at the Art Deco style rounded counter bar. Very good Long Island Ice Tea. The service includes a really nice vegetable plate and fantastic bread. We started with the warm bacon and the hearts of romaine salads. Both were great. The famous pepper steak did not disappoint. Most tender and flavorful filet minion I have ever tasted with asparagus and fully loaded baked potato. All was excellent. The bread pudding for desert was great. My wife said... ""This is the way bread pudding is supposed to taste."" Wonderful service also.",0
1040,4670,"The Dal Rae is a CLASSIC JEM steak house. We have been going their for more than 40 years - since we were kids
with our parents and now we take our friends and it is consistently excellent!!!
Service is beyond spectacular - you are treated so well. They want you to enjoy every part of the dining experience, and it truly is an experience.
The food is as good as always - We have never had a bad experience - EVER. They will even prepare entrees from the menu
of 40 years ago that are no longer on the menu - we loved it 40 years ago - we still love it today. If you want a classic
steak house dining experience that's truly old school and done right - you have to go to the Dal Rae! Excellent!!!",0
1041,4671,I have dined at the Del Rae several times and plan to return. It is one of the few excellent family owned establishments left that provides a great dining experience. The food is great and the device good. Their specialties can only be found there,0
1042,4672,One of the few steakhouses still around from when I was growing up in the early 60s.,1
1043,4673,"I had not been to the Dal Rae for a minimum of 10 years and was very pleased that the ambiance, food and service level is still amazing. I hosted a friends birthday and she was thrilled as a first timer, and not disappointed in the least.",0

1046,4676,We had a great experience and it was our first time at Dal Rae. It is so sad that great places like this are becoming few and far between. I would recommend Dal Rae to anyone considering the rest of those chain places. Thanks to the our great waitress for wonderful service and we will be back.,1
1047,4677,This is our third time dining here. The food and service hasn't disappointed us yet. We always order the filet mignon and tastes delicious!,0

1051,4681,"What a fabulous spot! Dal Rae is a very special trip down memory lane, when one received a complimentary appetizer tray with dinner, a steak came with side plentiful side dishes and choices, and the menu had such wonderful variety it was hard to decide what to select! The room was gorgeous with little, tiny lights and crisp linen tablecloths. Other than the smal lamps on the tables, the setting was dimly romantic and soothing. Although modern cuisine is lovely, I am so glad to know we still can participate in what is the very BEST cuisine from yesteryear! I would heartily recommend this spot! Cheers to the Chef and Staff!",0
1052,4682,Just one terrific meal after another. Enough said!!!!!!,1

They pour them with 4.5 oz of booze and they are really strong. As for dinner, everything there is excellent. We had the surf and turf combo which was a steak and white sea bass plate (ate every last piece of it). Be prepared to spend some cash if you come here though. Want to impress your date? Family in from out of town? This is for sure the spot.",0

1062,4692,The wife and I celebrated our 57th wedding anniversary the service was outstanding the food was very good we enjoyed it .We will be back.,1
1063,4693,"This restaurant is great, especially if you're in the area and looking for something a bit upscale but don't want to drive far. It has a very classy, old-school vibe here. The menu is on the expensive side, but definitely worth it. Service may not be as quick as you're used to, particularly if you go on a busy night, but my boyfriend and I went on a Monday night and the service was just fine.

The Teriyaki Tidbits appetizer was a good way to start the meal. The Large Filet Minon Pepper Steak was cooked to perfection and had a lot of flavor. The Chicken Breast with Wild Mushrooms was slightly overcooked but still very flavorful. The Banana Flambe for 2 dessert was prepared tableside and was a delicious way to end the night.",0
1064,4694,"The Dal Rae has been a great place for my wife and I to enjoy a great meal and celebrate special occasions for the past 15 years. Last night was no exception! We celebrated my wife's birthday with our two young daughters and had an amazing time. My wife and I shared the Tomahawk Ribeye, 34oz I believe and my daughters enjoyed the prime rib and of course ended the meal with the chocolate souffle. Thanks to the staff for everything.",0

1066,4696,"The service is incomparable. This is a professional wait staff who make Cesar salads and cherries jubilee table-side. I always recommend Dal Rae and make sure everyone knows it's an extraordinary restaurant - a throwback to a time when good service mattered.

Dont miss their cheese toast, their bread basket and their chocolate souffle! Good, fresh fish and shellfish too.Portions are generous (i usuaslly take home a doggie bag).

1084,4714,Food is old school but high in quality.,1
1085,4715,"This was a birthday celebration, and it was, as usual, an outstanding experience. We tend to go to Dal Rae for their 14 oz. pepper steak. Can eat the rest of it the next two days. The garlic bread is to die for and the garlic mashed potatoes are super. In season, I like the parmesan incrusted halibut and it is unbelievable.",0
1086,4716,The food and service were excellent as usual,1
1087,4717,"We came here to celebrate an anniversary, and based on other reviews, we were expecting to be pleased. Dal Rae did not disappoint. The ambiance, the menu, the service, all are living relics from the past---all done with top quality. I was happy to see that they had classic dishes like duck a la orange, and lobster thermidor on the menu. We had the lobster bisque, their famous pepper steak (a prime new york steak, by the way), and the bananas flambe--all were wonderful. Portions are beyond generous. I also really liked that our server prompted us with questions like, ""Are we ready to order, or do we want to relax and enjoy the wine for a while?"" It really reinforced that one should enjoy and take their time with the dining experience.",0
1088,4718,Dal Rae is a Southern CA classic and a place to return to again and again.,1

to serve their followers with the quality of food & service that we find here.",1
1098,4728,"We loved it reminded us of the great steak houses of the past. Real food , cooked well, served well. A great Martini,super waitress the owner suggested the wine. Really fun. No one bugged us to leave so we lingered over coffee. Hysterical, happy rowdy piano bar. Would like to go back for that also.We will return, reminded us of Chicago or New England.",0
1099,4729,"Dal Rae is not your run of the mill restaurant, this little neighborhood gem is suprizingly located in the heart of Pico Rivera, the last place you would every expect a high end restaurant to be? The food is fantastic, as well as the service, these types of family owned resturants are far and few between. I had the Fettochini pasta with a bowl of New England Clam Chowder and my mom had Sushimi style Tuna on Bruchetta type bread slices, unbelieveable! This place is nothing short than ""Outstanding"" and a must visit location, I've been a devoted fan since my father began taking me there which should tell you how long they've been around, I was 16 at the time and now 56, the place is historic, but doesn't look old at all!",0
1100,4730,Always enjoy my evening and dinner here. Very friendly Mgr.,1

1102,4732,"What can I say about this place? It is like stepping into another world, another century. Just go with the flow and enjoy the long wait for your reservation, dance, drink, watch the people come and go, with the look of someone having just left the bowling alley and then dressing up in their finest duds to transcend themselves into another century. It is fun, it is tasty, it is divine!",1

1106,4736,We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and never felt rushed. All the food was very well prepared and desserts were great. The server(s) came around when needed and didn't hover over us the entire time -which led to a feeling the we could stay longer and enjoy our dinner and conversation. Music in the restaurant was low enough to hear but not distract. We will definitely be returning...,0

1108,4738,"We've been coming to the Dal for over 30 years! We've watched it evolve from a ""good old boys"" restaurant to a very sleek and modern restaurant. One thing that hasn't changed over the years is the quality of the food and service. It is one of a small handful of restaurants that still prepares food tableside. I LOVE that about the Dal!!",0

1115,4745,"Food service and ambiance are excellent. My friend had the crab louie which had lots of crab and a nice thousand island dressing, but was disappointed that it wasn't a louie dressing. I had the house chopped salad. Both salads were deliciouse. The bread was fresh. Service was attentive. A delightful lunch. Will be returning soon.",1
1116,4746,"We had dinner at Dal Rae before with fond memories. We remembered great ambiance, service and food. We went back to celebrate Valentine's Day during the lunch hour. We were not disappointed and experienced another great time. It's no wonder they have been in business for over 50 years. Although a bit expensive, it is worth going to Dal Rae to celebrate a special occasion because you will have a memorable time. Dal Rae is exceptional for beautifully prepared food, great taste, fantastic service and you will leave with a wonderful experience and fond memories. We plan to go back not just to celebrate a special occasion, but because we had a great time and enjoyed the food. They make you feel special like a part of their family.",0

1120,4750,it is always a pleasure and very enjoyable to dine.,1
1121,4751,Nice restaurant. I like the throw back from the 50's and 60's. No one has lobster thermador anymore or cherries jubilee. It is fun to go back in time. Even the music was live singing of the oldies. Their meat is prime quality and very good.,0
1122,4752,I have been going to the Dal Rae for 30 years. This place rocks! I have always had a great meal and a great time at the Dal Rae. It is a must!,1

1133,4763,"It was our first time at Dal Rae, and we will be back. The menu contained some truly original dishes that you would not expect to find. Everything we ate was delicious and we need to return so that we can taste the dishes we could not order the other night. The service was impeccable and if you're lucky, you'll get one of Cary's tables!",0
1134,4764,"This is a classic throwback... been around forever. Food is consistently good. Nothing nouvelle, and not really for foodies... It's a good solid comfort place. Caesar salad tableside is a nice touch... and tastes like no other... garlic bread ... nice.",0
1135,4765,Great Dining experience. Been going there for over 30 years and never disappoints in food or service,1
1136,4766,"Dal Rae is a throwback to the 1950's: a dining event, with great food & service, in a comfortable dark, wood paneled room. A large, well-stocked bar just adds to that feeling. Service was prompt, but never rushed. Wine list was adequate. Corkage is $20.
The food was superb. The ladies shared a baby greens with goat cheese salad, while the gents had a classic Caesar Salad for 2, prepared tableside and done the old-fashioned way with a raw egg and the anchovies mashed into the dressing.
The men both had Steak au poivre, a 16 oz New York, prepared perfectly. The ladies had Veal Oscar and Medallions of Filet, with bearnaise & mushroom sauces. Baked potatoes & asparagus for all. Too much food to have dessert. Expensive, but we'll be back!",0
1137,4767,There is NO better Restaurant!!!! A Sounthern California GEM!,1
1138,4768,"We were in the area to attend the Rose Bowl and decided to try the Dal Rae after the reviews on Open Table and we were not disappointed. It was New Years Eve and the flat rate price per person was up there but we loved the restaurant, the food and the service. We could not have done better. We were a table of 4 and were not rushed to finish for the 9:00 pm sitting and in fact didn't leave until after 10:00 pm. Super excellent service. Absolutely loved this restaurant!",0
1139,4769,"The Dal Rae is a throw back in time to when people held power lunches in deeply comfortable burgundy booths with rich wood finishes over exceptional fish, beef or chicken dishes with a great cocktail.

The place is large and usually close to full. The service is spot on and the food is consistently outstanding. Being operated by the second generation of the founding family the Dal Rae has roots deep in the community but could stand with the best in any city in the world. Owning a company in the area, anytime we have a corporate function, guests from overseas, or simply want a great meal the Dal Rae is the first choice.

In the simplest possible terms, ""Go there you wont be disappointed"".",0

1149,4779,"Historical Venue.. for the holidays they cut the menu down. Not happy with the presentation as they are know for table side things (Steak Diane, Caesar Salad) We ordered the salad expecting to see it made table side but the place was too packed to do it. I asked for my steak to be medium rare and I got medium well. I think next time I will go when its not close to the holiday.",0
1150,4780,"This is a gem. Both the food and the service were excellent (and we were there on a busy evening). The crowd was exuberant; full of real Angelenos (as opposed to the beautiful people who fill too many L.A. dining spots) who believe in dressing up for a nice dinner; not a pair of jeans in the room, which was very refreshing. It's been a long time since I've dined in a place so full of happy people. Loved it!",1
1151,4781,It was my first time going to the Dal Rae and my fiance and I loved it. Since it is almost Christmas they had the place well decorated was a winter wonderland.

For us this was going to be an adventure..Rainy night in LA..25 mile drive..Saturday night...birthday dinner for my wife. We did call them to let them know we would be a half hour late for our reservation, traffic was awful. Upon our arrival all went smoothly and without drama...Cutting to the chase. After a 5 minute wait (enough time to get drinks at the bar) we got the booth we asked for and the ordering began. The crab cakes are special, get them. The house special filet pepper steak was incredibly tender and flavorful. Their prime rib was also very flavo",1

Leather booths; knowledgeable, courteous wait staff, great bartenders; old-fashioned relish tray (crinkle-cut carrots, celery, green onions). You want to live through a solid 1950s dining experience?

The butter and onion topping melts in your mouth. We ended with a chocolate souffle which wasn't too sweet and accompanied their homemade whip cream. Delicious night with good friends.

This was my first time to order fish instead of my regular filet- the filet is usually perfectly fine- but I don't know if I will get it again- the sea bass was outstanding. I got it a'la Ben- their signature presentation- which comes in a bur blanc sauce with caramelized onions on top- it was unlike any other sea bass I've had before and absolutely lovely.

My husband and daughter got their regular- lamb chops with garlic mashed and said it too was the best they'd had- not sure if there was someone new in the kitchen- but in the 6 or so times we've been out to Pico Riviera- this was the best from table side caesar to soufle",0

We spent many an evening in it's warm ambiance eating wonderful food. Now that my father is gone we meet my college roommate and her husband here and enjoy the same excellent dinners that I remember with my dad. On Saturday, the son and nephew of the owners made their fabulous Caesar salad tableside and the meal, as usual, was delicious. It was packed, so we aren't the only folks who appreciate this terrific place who take food and a warm atmosphere seriously so their customers can spend a very enjoyable evening. The caesar salad is the best I've ever eaten. Bravo!",1

We had escargot for appetizers, prime rib & their famous pepper steak for our main entrees. Everything was cooked to perfection. The portions were large & we had to take home half of the food on our plates. Our entree came with relish tray (various fresh vegetables on ice), bread basket & garlic cheese bread.

1243,4873,One of the best restaurants I have been to in a long time. The service was impeccable and the variety of choices on the menu made it hard to decide on what to have.

Food is delicious and would definitely return. The entire staff were very friendly and highly recommend.
Thank you!",0

1268,4898,This is one of those places that reminds you not to judge a book by its cover.  The outside of the restaurant is a little run down.  The inside is fairly nice.  The food is amazing and is one of the few places that serves soufle.  I have been here a few times and will continue to return.  The fish and steaks are delicious.  Steak Diane is their thing and a must order.,0

1273,4903,Dal Rae hit the spot for a romantic intimate valentines dinner! We made a reservation so we didn't have to wait for a table but since it was Soo busy the service was a little slow. I would recommend going on a night when they have their regular menu & when it's not as busy. The food was amazing! The teriyaki tid bits were my favorite! The pepper steak filet mignon was incredible! I have never had steak the way it is prepared at dal Rae's! The mashed potatoes were perfect- not too much garlic & not bland. Overall I give dal Rae a 10/10 :),0

Not to many choices like the Dal Rae around anymore without the noise and overcrowding, their service is first class and the food is amazing, the shrimp scampie and their peppercorn steak is just awesome I could probably it eat just about raw and I order my steak well done! If you haven't tried you're missing out!",0

1282,4912,"The lobster thermador was creamy deliciousness, while the rib eye steak was tender savory goodness. We had the scallops cava d'oro as a surprisingly tasty appetizer with an amazing hollandaise sauce. The vevlvety garlic mashed potatoes complemented the rib eye, and the decadent tiramisu with raspbery and white chocolate drissle was pure joy. The quality immediately matches the price. The valet only enhanced our evening. Very upscale, very romantic ambiance at night, and very much worth it.
Reservations on Open Table allowed me to personalize the night by adding that it was my wife's birthday and they came out with a birthday cake and sang. That personalization was nice and I will definately use that feature again on my next visit.",0

1286,4916,"It was my first visit and I had been hearing about it for years. I only had a protein shake for breakfast because I had heard the portions were big. I got the LA Dine menu. It was perfect for me, but I was very full. The three other people couldn't finish their meals! Large portions to justify the prices. Just go hungry, everything was delicious.
I would consider offering something other than the cheesy bread - too caloric and not very good. Do a bread basket like Parkwaygrill. The salmon was delicious and also the mashed potatoes, desserts were good, too. Service was wonderful. This is a friendly place. I like the vegetables at the beginning.",0
1287,4917,Chilean seabass al a Ben was delicious as well as the peppered filet mignon.,0
1288,4918,"The Dal Rae is a delicious little time capsule in the middle of Pico Rivera. It is like walking back into a time when you took your best girl out for a nice dinner with crisp table cloths and a good steak in a dark restaurant. It's also echoes of the days of the three martini lunches! It's just a gem from the past.

My mom and I decided to go for lunch during DineLA week. In fact, my dad had taken her here for their very first date forty-seven years ago! My daddy had class. I had the ahi sashimi on toast, which was just wonderful little bites, and my mom had the fried calamari, which was perfectly done and not overcooked. We then both had the Filet Mignon with Bernaise sauce and both were cooked to perfection! Just a beautiful lun",0

1313,4943,My wife and I took a client and his wife for dinner. They loved the food and atmosphere. Couldn't beleive how many people were there. The Bar does't hold enough people due to the small tables they use for dining. I love the place and haven't talked to anyone that has not liked the food.,0
1314,4944,"I thought I would have a quiet Sunday night dinner with my wife. When we arrived, I was surprised to see it packed. The noise level was too high to talk at times because the tables are too close together. Alcohol made the crowd disruptive and loud. The server was friendly although inattentive at times. Later, when the crowd thinned, the service improved. The Rock Shrimp appetizer was great. It was delicate and flavorful. Just right and perhaps the best I have had. The Cesar Salad was next and prepared tableside just for us. It was wonderful. We both ordered the Pepper Filet Mignon and enjoyed it immensely along with loaded baked potatoes prepared at our table. Overall the food was great. We will return for a special occasion.",1
1315,4945,"Been going to Dal Rae for over 10 years. Probably is my favorite restaurant because the food is outstanding, the service is genuine, and the experience is always consistently great. Lunch and dinner are both very, very, good!",0

1323,4953,We took a friend to introduce her to the restaurant. She ordered the Manhattan Clam Chowder and the fish special. She said they were both the best she had ever eaten in a restaurant. We all shared the appetizers and a dessert and could not have been happier with our choices!!!,0
1324,4954,"Although our experience was great! It always is very nice and food is always outstanding. Our Server wasn't exactly attentive. I have been a customer for awhile now and this past visit was just ""OK"". to us for quite some time but passed our table numerous times to ask others how was",1

1335,4965,"Del Rae is the only place to get a prime rib that will just melt in your mouth and satisfy your ""red meat"" cravings. We've been going there for years and are always met with a beautiful and memorable experience. We look forward to seeing Monica, who is one of our favorite waitresses, and also the owners of Del Rae always come by to greet each of their guests personally. If you are fortunate enough to dine at Del Rae's during the Christmas Holidays, you will be amazed at how beautiful dining can be.....,",0
1336,4966,"Great food. Prime rib was one of the very best. The wife loves the cottage fries, if you go you must try them. We have been there at least 5 times and will be going back. Dal Rea has been there since the late 50s. In this environment that say's it all.",0

1339,4969,"Celebrated a birthday and the dinner was wonderful. Have been going to Dal Rae for over thirty years and the food is still one of the best in Los Angeles.

1340,4970,"""I love the relaxed feel of this place - dark, small and cozy â like a comfortable living room.Service was well-timed and friendly. I have been comming here a long time and will continue to do so.",1
1341,4971,"Was very pleased, although how do I get my 100 points I was promised?",1
1342,4972,"Restaurant is a real find and worth the drive. Located ""in the middle of nowhere"", the menu is a tribute to fancy restaurants of the 50's. So nice to have large portions of carefully prepared food, unlike the trendy restaurants with odd flavor combinations and small portions on large plates with even heftier prices. The tableside Caesar salad was to die for (ask for low oil and heavy anchovies), the prime rib rich and flavorful, the baked potato gigantic and wonderful tasting, the service very ""homey."" Minor quibbles: We had to wait for our table in the noisy bar area for a half hour past our reservation time, the only vegetables offered with our entrees was boring broccoli, & the chocolate souffle was too sweet and texture too mushy.",0
1343,4973,The Dal Rae simply cannot be beat! It is always excellent in all categories!,1
1344,4974,"Dal rea never ceases to amaze me always great pepper steak and awesome soufle, ceasat salads are tossed and made right in front of your table.",1
1345,4975,"I've been going to Dal Rae for 35 years and it has always been the same welcoming place with terrific food and attentive staff.
The menu items are more current but have always featured healthy choices. Nice to be able to get Chilean Seabass when you want it, but their fish is always fresh and expertly prepared.

I'll be coming back for the next 35 years.",0

1349,4979,"A restaurant with great food and great character. I have not eaten a better meal anywhere, including the old Perino's. Great service and try, if you can, to leave room for desert.",0
1350,4980,One of Southern California's BEST restaurants!,1
1351,4981,"A really nice place, with good food. Now, if they could not keep you waiting once you sit down, that would make them as special as their legend. This was my first time, and I was looking for a really special evening, having driven out from downtown L.A. The steak was more pink than medium rare, but I actually liked it because the meat is great. After being seated on a night that wasn't busy at all, it took a little while before we were noticed by our (?) waitress. A waiter sat us down handed us menus, and put a little plate of butter on the table which I looked at for awhile thinking, ""does this mean I get bread?"" Once we were finally noticed things went fairly well. It was the 1st steakh. that my martini was in a sm. rock glass,not martini",0
1352,4982,"First time visit, hostess was friendly and waitress was outstanding. I will definitely be back. Restaurant has the traditional ""supper club"" atmosphere. Love it!",0
1353,4983,"Del Rae's has a long standing reputation as a fine dining restaurant with a lot of history. The area surrounding Del Rae's, Pico Rivera, is not great by any means, but once you enter the restaurant, you're in a completely different enviornment altogether, plush decorations, comfortable booth & table seating and great attentive service! The food is absolutely fantastic & the prices are moderate to high, not what you would expect from a restaurant located in this area. Del Rae's is worth the trip & experience, especially during the holiday season, the restaurant is beautifully decorated during the Xmas season, you have to see it to believe it!",0
1354,4984,"Whether you're there for just drinks, an appetizer, full dinner or just dessert; everything is a hit when you're at the Dal Rae.",1

1357,4987,You must have the pepper steak if you ever go there!,0
1358,4988,Loved the ambience. My girlfriend and I were celebrating our birthdays and catching up. We dined for almost three hours and were not rushed. We were each surprised with a candle on a slice of birthday cake.,0
1359,4989,This was our first visit. The Del Rae Restaurant is a Classic dining experience. We had a very nice experience. It is truly one of a kind!!! What a treat!!! We highly recommend the Chateaubriand for two ( tableside service ) and the Escargot. :) Before dinner cocktails were fabulous!!! Watch for celebs on week nights.,0

Monica, our server, was great and very attentive as usual.",0
1363,4993,"Food was excellent, as always. Great lunch menu, well priced and plenty of choices, salads, pasta, meats, sandwhiches, specials. One complaint that is significant. In the real world, medium rare, is medium rare. Medium is medium. Medium well is medium well. The Dal Rae kitchen staff has a consistent problem with thier cuts of Prime Rib. When a cutomer orders Medium Rare, the customer should not receive ""very rare."" When the waitress says, ""We serve our medium rare as rare,"" there is something very wrong.",0
1364,4994,I am only sorry we didn't find the Dal Rae sooner. Fabulous!!,1
1365,4995,I am only sorry we didn't find the Dal Rae sooner. Fabulous!!,1

1368,4998,"A beautiful place for a special evening. It was our first anniversay.
Highly reccomend the Piano Bar after dinner (or even eat in the bar and enjoy during dinner).",0
1369,4999,"Friends took us here for dinner, we had never heard of this wonderful spot...how sad for us! Dinner was excellent, from the wedge salad which was so crisp to the flavorful, tender filet mignon...yummm....and to top it top it off a grand marnier souffle for dessert! Delicious! Oh! And I almost forgot the amazing cheesy garlic bread they brought with dinner! An A+ experience from start to finish, we will be back!",0
1370,5000,Absolutely hands down the best resturant for Steak and specialty entrees. I'm so glad we were able to celebrate Father's Day!,1
1371,5001,We really enjoyed Father's Day there. The service was good as was the food. The Chilean Sea Bass ala Ben was a real standout. But the true winner for dessert is their bread pudding.,0
1372,5002,The food is always fantastic. The table side caesar is one of the best you will ever enjoy.,0
1373,5003,"Enjoyable atmosphere, friendly staff, and wonderful food. In the bar lots of beautiful people enjoying great music. Perfect, perfect, perfect.",1
1374,5004,"I have to admit this has been my favorite restaurant for more years than I care to share. The food here is outstanding. I had the Chilean Sea Bass ala Ben and it is the best sea bass I have ever had. The service is always great and you will get a family member making a fabulous Caesar salad at your table. Very much much old style in its decor but very nice. If you like an outstanding steak or piece of fish, this is the place.",0
1375,5005,Friendly and attentive service. Food is delicious!! Nice place for that special occasion.,1
1376,5006,"We celebrated a birthday and anniversary. The Dal Rae is top notch for service, ambiance, and food. Be sure to save room for dessert! The prime rib was delicious!",0
1377,5007,"Dal Rae has the BEST food and service! EVERYTHING was wonderful! I would definitely recommend Dal Rae to everyone. The steak, chicken and sea bass were excellent, very flavorful and unbelievably delicious, I will be back soon! Customer service was great as well, the waitress was very nice and helpful.",0
1378,5008,Always a pleasure at the Dal Rae!,1
1379,5009,Dal Ray is quite pricey but worth it for a special occasion. Did not like the fact that one had no choice but to use Valet parking but it was only $3.50. Evertyhing else was perfect....,0
1380,5010,Old school food and service. Where else can you find lobster thermidor and ceasar salads prepared table side. Retro but great!,0
1381,5011,Excellent menu options - taste was great. Been here several times and haven't been disappointed once.,1
1382,5012,Great table side Ceasar salad...one of the best I have had!! the dinner for two was fabulous...but too much food...the leftovers fed my two children the next day!!,0

1385,5015,"I went there twice in one week, first with my team from work, then I was so excited to go back with my mom. On Saturday night, if you go on the weekend even with reservations, be prepared for a wait. The reason not highest marks for service was that 1) the 30 minute wait was unexpected, and we weren't warned, so we waited at the bar not knowing it would be more than half an hour. After I asked a second time the bartenders tried to rush our seating, but it was obvious due to the crowd little could be done, but then the hostess actually said she kicked some folks out for us and was apologetic. 2) there was a man that was rude to a waitress and just obnoxious, I wish they had asked him to behave or leave, he almost ruined a couples 25th!",0
1386,5016,"We don't go to LA often, but when we do, Dal Rae is one place we go for dinner. Service was extra outstanding and the food out of this world. The Wedge of Lettuce with Blue Cheese Dressing is legendary and the Abalone was delicious. All four of us ordered something different and loved every bite. I highly recommend the Dal Rae food and serving staff. However, upon arriving and being told there was a $3.50 charge for us to park our OWN car in your UN-BUSY lot, we were so incensed by the insult that we turning around to leave when the ""Head Valet"" wisely decided to ""Comp"" us. When a party is spending over $250.00, charging $3.50 to self-park is an insult. PRINCIPAL is involved here and there are OTHER good places to eat in the LA area.",1
1387,5017,"Lovely service, great food (and presentation), and just a great, friendly place to dine.",0
1388,5018,Great service and feels like you have stepped back in time.,1

1395,5025,The BEST King Crab Legs in town!!,1
1396,5026,"I took my SO to Dal Rae for dinner for his birthday. He has gone to the Dal Rae for over 30 years and asks to go back every year. We were met by a very gracious hostess who assured us that our reserved table would be ready in just a few minutes. A quick trip to the bar for a glass of a decent house chardonnay was all it took before were were ready for our dining experience. We were given a nice half-booth where we could see all the action in the room and even watch the band playing in the bar area. Our server was prompt and efficient. She greeted us, offered a wine list and made sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable. Then she took our orders right away and made sure the wine and food were delivered & were satisfactory.",0
1397,5027,"We have been here many times but not recently. Everything was as wonderful as ever.
The service is impeccable, the food is outstanding and the atmosphere is lively and
positive. We were entertaining out-of-town relatives who we hadn't seen for quite some
time. We spent over three hours at dinner and loved every minute of it.",1
1398,5028,Dal Rae is one of my favorite places! I have lived in Pico Rivera since 1953 and grew up dining there. It's never really changed which is a great thing. You expect a great meal and you always get one.,0

1407,5037,"We had the DineLA dinner special, such a great deal $34 for a 3-course meal. Yummmm the Dal Rae never fails.",0
1408,5038,My meal was yummy as usual. My friend did like the tiramisu as it had a rasberry sauce which is not traditional and detracts from the flavor. I just love this place.,0
1409,5039,"As always, service was good and most of the food was good. We thought that the claims we had for an appetizer was just so-so...very fishy tasting. The zuchinni's were just a little overdone. Otherwise, everything we had (which was alot) was very good...shrimp cocktail, oysters rockefeller, fresh oysters, calamari, stuffed mushrooms, wedge salad and our entrees.

Dawn was our server and was very good.",0

1414,5044,"Love this place. First time that I was to see the decorations for the holidays and it makes the inside beautiful.

Food very good. Ahi appetizer still the best around. Superior white fish was good but prefer the sole which they were out of. Service excellent and drinks always great.",0
1415,5045,The stuft crab mushrooms were the best! And their new york steak was to die for!,1
1416,5046,"We were vacationing in the area and are so thankful we heard about this hidden gem, tucked away in a somewhat surprising neighborhood. A very popular spot among the loyal locals, we loved the classic ambiance and exceptional service. Although we had to wait a little even with a reservation, we enjoyed spending time in the bar area with live music and the food was well worth the wait! The calamari appetizer was great and the Caesar salad out of this world. The filet was among the best I've ever had. We will definitely return if ever back in the area.",0
1417,5047,AS ALWAYS WE HAD A VERY ENJOYABALE EVEING AND DINNER,1
1418,5048,"Being a life long resident of Southeast Los Angeles, I always feel that going to Dal Rae is like going back home. From the warm service, retro decor to the amazing taste of a pepper steak that remains unchanged to perfection. Over the years, I have made many friends of mine also fans of Dal Rae and they do not mind the drive from places as far as Pasadena or Sun Valley. Dal Rae es mi casa y su casa.",0

1423,5053,Wonderful restaurant!! Went for a birthday dinner around Christmas time and the restaurant was decorated beautifully for the holiday! Food was outstanding and the service was even better!!! Would highly recommend for any occasion!!!,1
1424,5054,"The food and service was really good. We went for a special birthday. We have been coming here for over 30 years! The only thing that was not good was when we made the reservation, I specifially asked for a booth away from the kitchen and any bussing stations. They tried to sit us next to both. The hostess was not being very accomodating and said that was the only table left and would we care to wait about 30 minutes for a booth that we might want. I said no, I see a table that is open and I made these reservations far enough in advace for you to take care of this. I was then very quiet and the hostess did seat us in a nice booth. That was awkward but after that eveverything was great.",0

1428,5058,I have been going to Dal Rae since 1987 when I worked across the street at Northrop. About twice a week I gould go there for lunch. This lasted to 1999 when I was transferred to another location. During that time I NEVER had one bad meal and many outstanding meals. Since that time I average one dinner a month with my wife. Again never a bad meal and most were outstanding. Service is impecible - particulary the waiter and waitresses. There have been times when I ordered a special meal ahead of time and they are always done to perfection. Bottom line - Dal rae belongs in the top 3 resturants in the Los Angeles Orange County area.,0

1437,5067,"The Dal Rae has been a family tradition for three generations, so we knew we were in for a good time. We were seated next to a LARGE family who was quite loud and we had a hard time hearing our own conversation. The food was fantastic (the pork chop had maybe a little too much rosemary -- order extra pickles). Because of the large party, a lot of our ""tableside entertainment"" (them making the baked potato, bananas flambe, etc."" had to be done else where and just delivered to our table. Still, dinner was great.",0
1438,5068,The standard of excellence!! Bananas Flambe was wonderful!!! This restaurant is like going back in time. Warm competent servers. Beautiful lighting. Elegant!!!!,1
1439,5069,"Dal Rae never disappoints. The food is always excellent, with service to match. I used to always get the lobster (a splurge!), until I discovered their whitefish 'a la ben'. Just fantastic meal and look forward to having it again soon. Just love this place.",0

1444,5074,"We took advantage of the Dine LA special 3 course meal. The fire roasted artichoke was a real winner. Our filets were done to perfection. They were served with a baked potato and crisp green beans. Small portions of dessert topped off the meal in a delighful way. Our service was excellent, attentive without being bothersome. The restaurant itself is a delight of 60s booths and tables in a dark, romantic ambiance.",0

1453,5083,"Had the prime rib, absolutely outstanding. Wife had the small filet and it was actually as large as most other ""regular size"" filets. Did not like the grilled green onions, too overpowering, will tell them to leave it off next time. Everything was great, can't wait to try the hamburger.",0
1454,5084,"The wonderful elegant / casual set-up was perfect.
Very pleasant, great experience for us.
Would definitely do this for special occasions.",1

1457,5087,"The Dal Rae is a classic where time stands still. Salads tossed at the table, friendly professional waitresses, red meat cooked to perfection and comfort everywhere. My Dad brought me here in the 70's and the food and feelings are still wonderful. This isn't a place for calorie counters but it is worth every penny and pound. Pepper steak, baked alaskan, caesar salad, medallions of filet and a rather magnificent chocolate souffle.",0

1462,5092,"As always, Dal Rae did not disappoint! I took my girlfriend there to celebrate her birthday. It was the first time she had been to Dal Rae! Since I have been going to Dal Rae for at least 20 years, I was comfortable recommending most things on the menu. We both had the halibut and my friend marveled at the perfect preparation. Our server made several suggestions for our dining experience and everything was FABULOUS111 I have never had a bad meal at Dal Rae and I know I will continue to dine there frequently.",0
1463,5093,"My wife, myself and two close friends drove over to Dal Rae from the Westside for our initial visit that was based on several recommendations from friends. We weren't disappointed! From the moment we were seated at a large comfortable booth and served the relish dish and bread through desert and coffee everything was perfecto. Great martinis. Our caesar salad was made tableside by a more ""senior"" member of the restaurant staff who took great pride in his preparation. The peppered steaks both filet and New York were delicious. Our server was well-informed and very attentive as were the wait staff overall.
This is definitely the place to go for a special occasion and we plan to be back.",0
1464,5094,"My husband and I have gone to your restaurant several times and we just absolutely love your food, my husband is especially fond of your Pepper Steak and how it's prepared and I love your Sea Bass.

A place where the owner takes time to chat with every table,  A place where the servers are there to serve you and enhance your dining experience, A place where a Chef takes great pride in his food.

1467,5097,"Had been wanting to try this place forever and finally found the right occasion. The restaurant is very easy to get to and the welcome was friendly. Prices are high but the food is outstanding and plentiful. I would not advise ordering a dessert souffle at the same time your food order is placed, as ours arrived in mid meal! Otherwise a memorable meal and we are looking forward to eating our way through the extensive menu.",0

Loren and Kevin are the second generation to run the restraunt and instead of missing a beat, as is sometimes the case, it is maybe even better than ever and that is really saying something.",0
1474,5104,"Loren and Kevin, Thanks again for a great meal. Ginger was a terrific waitress.",1
1475,5105,"Dal Rae is our ""go to"" place for a great dining experience. We've been long-time Dal Rae patrons, in all of their locations (in Los Angeles at Western Avenue, in Fullerton on Harbor Blvd, and now, in Pico Rivera). Our most recent--a wedding anniversary--in which every aspect contributed to make it a memorable event. We always order the Chateaubriand, not usually offered in today's restaurant menus -- the beef was prime, and prepared just the way we requested. The oysters on the half shell were fresh and cold, and the chocolate souffle was heavenly. Way to go, Smith Brothers!",0
1476,5106,"As always Dal Rae's doesn't disappoint. I had their veal picatta with zuccini dore, one of my favorites. Their ahi appetiser is unique served on small toast with feta cheese. Very delicious. I recommend this place.",1

1483,5113,"As always, great food & service.",1
1484,5114,"First-class food and service. Talk about retro! If it weren't for lack of cigarette smoke, it would be like dining in the 50's. We had the tableside prepared Caesar salad, Chateaubriand, and Gran Marnier souffle. Wine selection? Forget that! In the spirit of the ambiance, 12-year old Scotch. Just like in the good old days...",0
1485,5115,"It was just fabulous!! My husband and I needed a romantic night out last Saturday, and I choose this restaurant. We live just 20 min away so it was very convienent for us. The waitress was very nice and not too too talkative just enough for conversation.

Pros-Waitress (Pat) is seriously the cutest and funniest women I've met in a while! I LOVE eating out to different restaurant and it is VERY clear that their food is absolutely SUPERB... in both quality and quantity! It is very rare to find a restaurant with excellent meat and seafood together! The preparation of the food was absolutely original you'll see and extremely tasty! My mouth is still watering thinking about it.

Con-Location is 30 minutes too far for me! :)",0
1497,5127,"My 11-year old son and I visited Dal Rae for the first time on Jan 31, and it was absolutely spectacular. I loved the ambiance and the booth. Our server, Sonia, was very sweet to my son and made great recommendations. We took advantage of the Dine LA promotion and had the best filet mignon ever! My son ordered the ahi sashimi for his appetizer, and even before any of our food arrived he said ""mom, I love it here.. we need to come back again soon!""",0
1498,5128,"Since this restaurant is close to my place of employment, I have been going there for some 25 years plus. It's always very consistent with their service, food and the quality of their service help. It's one of my personal favorites. Their food is so yummy, their wine list is the best. Wonderful ambience, great for all the above situations including a romantic dinner. It's always very crowded....in this economy, I take it to mean it's providing exceptional service and food.",0
1499,5129,"First time there, and certainly won't be the last. A wonderful experience.",1

They still had the decorations up for Christmas--no one does kitsch like the Dal Rae!",1
1503,5133,"Institutions are often NOT institutional.
Such is the case with the venerable Dal Rae.
I've been coming here since a childhood (late 50's),

Mid week lunch was a delight - and you can get dinner menu items for the asking.",1
1504,5134,"I live in Woodland Hills and decided to take my girlfriend for a nice dinner after a friend recommended the Dal Rae. This restaurant exceeded every expectation of what I thought to be fine dinning. The ambiance was warm yet fun. Service was high end--they went out of their way to create a new experience in dining versus simply serving our meal. I had the sea bass and my gfriend ate her entire prime rib. We were literally there for 3 hours and enjoyed every minute of it! I highly recommend this place for a date, ask for a booth. Their booths make you feel like its your private piece of the restaurant.",0
1505,5135,"The food was very good and the service excellent the waitresses are very nice, friendly and smiling. We had a very nice time and will be regulars at this restaurant. We missed the champagne at midnight but all was wonderful.",1

1507,5137,"Food and service were outstanding - pricey, but we knew that when we made the reservation. The wait staff do an excellent job and know the menu very well.

At her recommendation, my friend ordered the beef barley soup which she said was wonderful. We also followed her advice and shared an order of Tiramisu which was the best we've had. We also liked the look of the restaurant; it reminded us of restaurants our parents took us to when we were young. All in all a great meal.",0

Jesus took so much pride in welcoming us and explaining the home made breads and other dishes. Our waitress, Monica,was equally enthusiastic and professional. The cocktails were generous, the breads superb including the delicious cheese bread served with the meal. Richard created a marvelous Cesar salad. The pepper steak was delicious.

1548,5178,"The Dal Rae reminds me of a 3 Martini 1960s expense account type of place. The closest that I have seen is Durant's in Phoenix, AZ. Dark colors, black ceiling, mixed drinks, flaming dishes, relish tray, made-at-your-table salads and baked potatoes. The prix fixe menu could even be called a bargain. Even if you have no reason to be in Pico Rivera, stop by.",0

Yes. I will always be back to Dal Rae because not doing so would be foolish.",0
1554,5184,"I've been here at least a half dozen times and it never fails to disappoint. Steak and lobster is the best and compares favorably to Fleming's, Morton's and the like but is much quieter.

This restaurant is top of the line, food, service, bar, ambiance Dal Rae has it all. The owners are ALWAYS on the scene making sure everyone is happy with the food and service. Dal Rae is like stepping back in time when dining out was a BIG DEAL. They have table side service for some of their dishes such as Steak Diane, Caesar and Spinach Salads, Bananas Flambe to name a few. Dal Rae has the right formula ! !

1574,5204,"One word: INCREDIBLE!!!!!! We had the Prime Rib and the King Crab Legs. The food was excellent, the seating was great, the service was nonstop. What else could you ask for in a restaurant. I just wished I stopped in and ate at the Dal Rae years ago.",1
1575,5205,"A great evening. Excellent food, great service and wonderful leather and wood ambiance. The only thing missing was the roaring fire.",1
1576,5206,You can't go wrong with the filet mignon or new york peppered steak.,1
1577,5207,"Me and my date had a geat time. From the moment we entered we were complimented on our good looks.
The Steak was great. I ordered the New York steak and she got the filet mignon. We enjoyed our visit to this restaurant. This was my first time at a more expensive restaurant. I felt a little awkward but I got over it.
The salad was a little weird but it was good.",0
1578,5208,DINNER WAS FANTASTIC! THE SERVICE WAS OUTSTANDING! DAL RAE'S IS BAR NONE THE BEST STEAKHOUSE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA!,1
1579,5209,Great restaurant for a great meal.,1
1580,5210,"You can't ever have a bad meal or experience at the Dal Rae, one of our FAVORITE restaurants of all time; at least, that's been my experience over the last 7 or 8 years that I've been going there several times a year. I only wish they were closer to Pasadena, so I could go even more often! The whole dining experience is a throwback to the 1950s, with many menu items you can't even FIND anywhere else, all done to perfection. One of the two brothers who own the place are always present, and the fact that it's been in the same family for over 50 years (and some of the staff members have been there over 30 years) shows you the kind of dedication to excellence they have at The Dal Rae!",0
1581,5211,We had an excellent lunch and the service was very attentive. The restaurant also has a nice bar area and 2 outdoor patio areas where you can eat. The menu is extensive and includes things that could be dinner. We will definitely be returning.,0
1582,5212,"A classic 50's steak house vibe with menu items you don't see anymore, such as Lobster Thermidor and Steak Dianne. Truly old school classic cuisine.",1
1583,5213,"Dal Rae has been around since FOREVER and is owned by the original family. Loren and Kevin (owners) are always at the restaurant and visit the tables to make sure all is going well. Dal Rae has a very 50's feel; you sort of expect to see Frank Sinatra to come rolling in. The food is FANTASTIC and they do some tableside service (Cesar salad, some desserts, steak Diane.) The bar is lively and they have a Piano Bar. I didn't check Great for Lunch because I don't go there for lunch but I do know that it is VERY POPULAR with business people. The bar also makes good strong cocktails.",0
1584,5214,One of the best steak houses around. Great pepper steak,1
1585,5215,"Great ambiance, food, and service. My family and I had a wonderful lunch for Dine LA.",1
1586,5216,"The restaurant has a Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra vibe starting from the outside 60's style sign to the tasteful wood and crystal interiors. Service was exceptional, with careful attention to detail, staff were warm and friendly. A plate of crudite was immediately served followed by an assortment of breads. We chose appetizers of sweet crabcakes and fresh ahi-sashimi toastettes. Entree was fork tender filet mignon and moist duck ala'orange. The duck was even dramatically flamed tableside. Food is delicious, classic and classy. Mr. Lorin Smith, the owner even visited and gave us a little history of how Dal Rae got its name. I love this place, I'm sure you would too!",0

1589,5219,"Although Dal Rae has been in business for 50 years, I discovered it last year, and it has never failed to deliver excellent food and service. Its location is not exactly convenient for me...I live in WLA and it's a bit of a drive from the Westside to Pico Rivera. However, it's definitely worth it, and I will continue to dine there and have already introduced several friends to the wonders of Dal Rae.",1
1590,5220,"My companion and I split the appetizers, which were FABULOUS and then had the Grenades of Filet. ALSO FABULOUS. Dessert was to die for.

The food is pricey for lunch, in my opinion, but was truly a wonderful meal. Our server, who's name I failed to note, was attentive, knowledgeable and thoroughly delightful.",1
1591,5221,One of our favorite spots. A good old fashioned classy restaurant. Quality across the board.,1
1592,5222,"The Dal Rae is 20 miles from where I live so I don't make it there that often but when I do, the drive fades into the background because the dining experience is always stellar. I went as part of the DineLA promotion and got to enjoy my favorite pepper steak along with the crabcake appetizer and tiramisu at an amazing price. I brought a friend for her first visit as I've talked up the pepper steak many times over the last several years and we've been for many a steak (and meal) over time, too, and she found the meal memorable as well. Although it wasn't a special occasion, a night at the Dal Rae always feels like one.",0

I bought my wife a navigation system as a present (I know it is not very romantic) but I punched in Dal Rae as our destination, which left her wondering as to this place we were going. We loved the whole experience. Without exaggerating this was the best meal I have every had. No Lie--My minister credentials are current.

1605,5235,"Ceasar salad is a must! Made right at your table the way it was originally created. The pepper steaks are rarely duplicated and you won't be disapointed. Seafood is the freshest with a variety of preparations. The service and decor is from the 50's when California fine dinning had the customer in mind; if you want it they will do it. Special occasion or when you deserve to be rewarded, this is the place.",0

Dal Rae is not in our neighborhood...we live in West L.A.; however, we will make the long drive out to Pico Rivera again.  It was that good and more.",0

1623,5253,"This is classic Americana cooking at its best,in an elegant but very comfortable and relaxed setting with professional but friendly servers.We've been coming for several years and really love the Dal Rae!The bone-in Rib Eye Steak was the BEST I've ever had, and as I told our terrific server, Rose,I now have a new ""favorite"" dish when I go there!It was juicy, tender and MUCH more flavorful and meaty than standard rib eye.My wife's Veal Piccata was so delicious (I stole a bite), along with the thin, pan-fried zucchini slices it came with, that she practically wanted to lick the plate!The relish tray they serve is a nice, and rare, touch, but my ONLY suggestion would be to include black and green olives on it,which they brought us on request!",0
1624,5254,"We were amazed to find this rare restaurant and the absolutely dedicated service.  The staff was spot-on all night and we were never found searching out service.

We've brought many friends and family over the years and are never disappointed.",0
1629,5259,The Dal Rae has been a gem of a restaurant for many years.  Their prime rib is the best in the L.A. area.,0
1630,5260,"We love the Dal Rae. The food is sort of old world dining with such things as Lobster Thermador and Oysters Rockefellar on the menu. The portions are huge and extremely well prepared and tasty. We did note that it was our 20th anniversary, but nothing was made of it (although we did hear birthday celebrations going on in other parts of the restaurant). Could it be because we are two women and not man and wife?",0
1631,5261,"DAM GOOD STEAK AND SEAFOOD!!!  THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT!!! IF DAL RAE'S HAD A CREDIT CARD, I WOULD BE A PLATINUM MEMBER WITH MILLIONS OF FREQUENT FLYER MILES!!!  INTIMATE SETTING FOR SETTING FOR ANY OCCASSION.",1

1635,5265,A gem of a place which has been popular (and deservedly so) for countless years. I have never had a bad meal there. The Scallops Cava de Oro may be my favorite appetizer ever and I have travelled and dined extensively around the world.,0

1643,5273,Old School fine dining. We've always had a great meal here. Wear loose pants.,1

1645,5275,"We celebrated a family members' birthday on Saturday. Brandon was our server and Nick was in training. The service was top notch. Brandon was very attentive to our needs. Nick is learning from the best.I like my drinks like I like my men - strong and sweet and make me feel a little giddy. I had the pomegranate margarita and a pear martini and they were both perfect.The Caesar salad prepared table side was amazing - chef's kiss! The Chilean sea bass was scrumptious and the garlic mashed potatoes were fire! My husband had the pepper steak, pictured below. My brother had the prime rib. It was as big as the ribs that tipped over Fred Flintstone's car at the drive-in movies. Okay, maybe not that big but it was gigantic. I rounded out the meal with the best tiramisu I've ever had.The service is great, the atmosphere is very classy and the food is delectable! Check out this place!",0
1646,5276,"Haven't been here in awhile.  Now, I'm wondering, why?   We had a very pleasant dinner here recently and were surprised at the service and quality of the food. They offer table side for some dishes : Cesar salad , banana flambé, cherries flambé  and chateaubriand .    The main dining room is traditional steak house vibe. ( dimmer with tables closer together.) We got seated in the side patio room. It had a more open and casual feel which we preferred. Mainly, there was more room between tables that we appreciated.   Bread service was great ! One variety  basket at the beginning and then another garlic cheese bread basket to accompany our main meal . I thought this was generous of the restaurant to provide the bread, especially  since other restaurants often charge for bread service!   Started with Cesar salad served table side.Nice server who explained how he was preparing it and told us some interesting history of their version of this salad .    All our entrees were  great! Pepper steak , bone in rib eye, short ribs and filet mignon.I was think thinking about getting the rib eye cap ( $72) , but decided to  get the whole bone in rib eye option ($68) . The price /quantity made more sense to me. My daughter said her short ribs were good too.      Bananas flambé for our entire table for dessert. The peach slices and a la mode were a nice touch. We each had our own dish. Everyone enjoyed this dessert.     This restaurant is back in my list for a great steakhouse. Can't wait to come back.",0
1647,5277,"I went to dinner here with an old friend and his son, celebrating the son's 18th birthday. The young man is only 6'3"" and 280, so we three settled into our booth with ease (grin).  Our waitress was Katrina. She and the other staff were excellent, friendly and very professional while keeping us smiling.We had the Oysters Rockefeller, which I'd never had before and they were excellent.  We all ordered the Prime Bone in Rib-Eye Steak (22oz) and it was surely the best steak I have ever had. At the end of the meal we were so satisfied that we couldn't think of desert, but the youngster got an ""on the house"" cookie with ice cream and a candle. He begged that we not sing ""Happy Birthday"" so I sang ""Feliz Cumpliaños"" instead.All in all it was a wonderful evening. The manager (or maybe the owner) asked if we had no ladies with us. We laughed together. He had that little glimmer in his eye that said he was a really good guy. Everyone who assisted us was friendly and professional.I can't get there very often, as the budget won't allow it. But when I have a very special occasion Dal Rae is my ""GoTo"" place and has been since about 1967. Yeah, I'm that old!Thanks to everyone at Dal Rae!!!",0
1648,5278,"We've lived in the general vicinity for decades but never knew about this place until now.  They've only been here for 50+ years. Either way, so excited to have found this place. We love prime rib and steaks and this place does not disappoint.When you enter, it has the smell and vibe of an old steak house. The decor is from the original era which is part of the charm of this place but it's well maintained and up-to-date. We came on a Friday night so they had live music.As for the service, our server was awesome. She was very friendly, helped with recommendations since it was our first time, and did a great job with our party.Now on to the food. Everything we ordered was so good. We ordered escargot, oysters, and jumbo shrimp for apps and they were all delicious. Especially loved the escargot. For entree, most of us ordered prime rib and the bone in ribeye. Quality of the meat, taste, and preparation were awesome. It's comparable to Lawry's but without the drive to Beverly Hills. The price is also comparable but with this place, you get SIDES. This just makes it well worth it. Although Lawry's has some delicious sides not available here, we're loving the selection here. The prime rib and rib eyes were cooked perfectly too.Overall, love this place. Will definitely be back for future special occasions.",0
1649,5279,This place is classic- always delivers quality service and everything you expect from an American steakhouse.Ribeye was juicy and tender with no need for any sauces.  The accompanying sweet corn and mashed potatoes makes a for great meal.  The prime rib was a huge size and the creamy horseradish complimented every bite.  The crab stuffed mushrooms were satisfying with a good portion of crab.We have been coming here for years and plan to return as long as they keep it as is.Live music on a Saturday night makes you want to stay longer.,1
1650,5280,"Came in again for DineLA, but this time I brought my Parents.  I got exactly the same thing as I did last time and it was still just as good.  2 Gentlemen in suits came to our table to see how everything was etc, I assume they were the Owners.Only thing is that the server who packed our to-go boxes forgot to pack my Wife's mashed potatoes.  Kind of a bummer when eating leftovers the following day.",0
1651,5281,"I live close by but have never eaten here before.  Saw the Dine LA for here and decided to give it a try.  Reservation was for 7PM on a Thursday.  Surprisingly it was packed.  Valet parked the car and checked in.  Was seated in about 2 minutes.For the Dine LA menu, I had the calamari, pepper filet and cheesecake.  ALL were excellent.  The calamari might have been one of the best I have ever had.  The pepper steak was real yummy, but beware if you don't like green onions because there are a lot.  The cheesecake was real good except I was so full I only took a few bites and brought it home.The ambience is like an old school fine dining steak house.  It's dim and lots of people moving around.  It is on the louder side, but I expected that.  The bar side had live music which was nice.I look forward to coming back again and trying different things on their menu.",0
1652,5282,"One of LA's classic old school restaurants.  This is the kind of place that needs to be on everyone's bucket list.The relish tray has to be ordered now instead of just appearing but that's a minor thing.  Otherwise all the classic dishes are still here.Start with a stiff well made cocktail.  Don't miss a course. It all needs to be tried.  Steaks, seafood, veal! Where else are you going to get lobster thermidor or abalone?When is your next special day? Go, go then!",1
1653,5283,"I love old school spots like this but sadly, the ""old"" is no longer present at Dal Rae.It was my first time in. I'd heard such great things...But sadly, a remodel sometime in the last 15 years has removed the magic of what I'm sure must've been an old gem.Instead of an old looking entrance, you are treating with the TJ Maxx-style stacked stone that everyone is doing... but shouldn't.The bar area is all new and not cozy, dark nor luxurious like it must have once been.My Caesar salad was drenched in a creamy dressing that had no taste of garlic or anchovy. The worst I've ever had in my life!Why do people screw with things?!!!Go check it out for yourself. It just depends what you are expecting. If you have no idea what I am even talking about, an old school steakhouse probably isn't important to you and you may just like it.",0
1654,5284,"Wow. I was here for a birthday dinner with a group of friends. The food, the drinks, everything was beyond expectation.Ok... drinks. Well served, no watered down liquor here. The carajillo is delicious. Try it as an end of meal drink, you won't regret it!Food:Table side Caesar salad 10/10 - flavors are amazing, best Caesar salad I've ever had.Chilean Sea Bass 10/10 - ok this dish is a must. Buttery, flaky, melts in your mouth. Delicious!Filet mignon pepper steak 10/10 - i like my meat medium rare. It was cooked perfectly. Flavorful, tender, with a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes.And of course, always make room for dessert.We had Soufflé. This was the perfect ending to our meal. It was my first time having this, there was Grand Marnier liquor in this. It was light and fluffy and the sauce..... I could have drank it. A Must try.Service 10/10 - staff was friendly and very attentive, gave us great suggestions on food and drinks. They made sure to check on us often and made sure everything was meeting our expectations.I cannot wait to be back.",0
1655,5285,First class all the way! Everyone is very attentive to your needs and wants. The ambiance is perfect for this establishment. My wife and I took some friends here for an early dinner this past Sunday. They are moving to Texas and we wanted a good meal for them to remember. The service from everyone who came to our table was excellent. The food was great!Thank you Dal Rae for helping to have a great dining experience for our friends.,0
1656,5286,This is solely based on service.  We went today for lunch and our server was Rosa - she was very rude from the moment she came to our table.  I understand lunch is busy but we pay for a premium restaurant and food yet her attitude makes us not want to come back.  When we asked for pepper she said you need to wait in a very hostile voice - not let me go get that. Again my expectation is that service is on point and today that was not the case!! The food as usual is utterly amazing but service needs to improve!,0
1657,5287,"Gosh I wish I could rate this restaurant more. I went for my birthday dinner, but didn't actually end up eating the main course.The oysters were good and the salad was fine. The chef forgot a lot of ingredients in the salad so I had to ask for those that were listed but not given. I don't know. For the amount of money, I would hope that the service, food quality, and timeliness of the preparation would be good too.The restaurant was very sorry and did provide us with compensation, but we had to box up our food because it was getting late and I wasn't able to eat it until later since I had to go to sleep.I'm a bit bummed and hesitant to go back. I want to since they had such good ratings, but maybe after they are better staffed and with more experience in the kitchen perhaps!To be fair: even after a day later the fish was pretty good! I think my fiancé said his steak was alright and it was better warm and fresh from the restaurant.",1
1658,5288,"Elevated dining experience!Coming here kinda brings to back to a feel from a different era. There's still some light holiday decor still up and the lighting has a more dim yellower hue.While they recommend more ""proper attire,"" website is just no hats, beachwear and sleeveless shirts. Most people wear nicer casual or better.We came on a rainy Sunday. It was pretty crowded perhaps they had to reseat all the patio reservations inside.  We ended up valet for $6 at dinner time.As a first visit we shared the seafood platter, Caesar salad, and got the 22oz prime rib and sea bass. All were great choices. the salad is supposed to be prepared table side but there wasn't enough space to push a cart through to our booth. We finished with the Dal Rae butter cake.",0
1659,5289,"First time here and I left very impressed. I can see why this place is so popular. Came here to celebrate my birthday with some friends. Started off with a drink at the bar. A delicious grey goose cosmopolitan while I waited for everyone to arrive.Once everyone arrived, we were seated in a gorgeous room with plenty of room. We started off with a wedge of iceberg salad. I always ask for mine chopped. Much easier to eat. Highly recommend this salad. It is a simple salad, but full of flavor. Paired with a rosé champagne and bread basket was simply a divine start. For my entree, I'm a sucker for chimichurri so I opted for the prime wagyu flat iron steak. It was delicious and enjoyed how my steak was cooked to perfection. For dessert we ordered strawberries loaded with Grand Marnier. Let me just say that it's one of those desserts you can't put down. Highly recommend.Service was excellent. Management came over several times to check in on us and ensure we were happy with our food. Overall, it was a fantastic place to celebrate any special occasion. Thank you Dal Rae for making my birthday dinner special, I look forward to my next visit.",0
1660,5290,"Old school customer service.A lot of restaurants can learn a lot from Dal Rae waiters. It's definitely an experience at Dal Rae that you feel like you're well taken care of.Inside Dal Rae is a time capsule. You'll feel like it's 1950. Vintage in good way.Loved the seafood tower here. Served for 2 but I think they gave us extra claws and shrimp since the lobster was lacking a little. That giant shrimp is memorable. The bread basket is somewhat simple. Sourdough and a few crackers and a slab of butter but the waiter did offer us some made to order garlic bread. Lots of butter and chopped up garlic was so good.We ordered the steak specials for the day, 12 oz prime cap of the ribeye and 16 oz filet mignon Creekstone bone in.  The prime cap served medium rare was more like rare. Love the fact they sliced it up. Good flavor. Served with crispy onions but a bit wilty and asparagus. The bone in file was pretty tasty as well. I've been a bit spoiled with steak and honestly, these steaks were good at best, but a bit under seasoned. I've had better but of course for the price point here, Dal Rae does a good job. I had a baked potato served tableside. Prepared in front of us tableside with a golf ball size of butter and sour cream and topped with chives. We felt special with this type of service.Best part of the meal.. The butter cake with vanilla ice cream. It took a while to make since it's made to order. Cake served warm, very buttery with a caramelized crust. This dessert is addictingly good.Worth the experience. I'll be back.",0
1661,5291,"TL;DR - yummy food and GREAT service, would come back again!I came here for my friend's graduation dinner on a Friday night. We were all in the Garden Room separate from the main dining sections of the restaurant. It was decorated super nicely and had multiple servers coming in and out at all times so you never had to worry about asking for more water or anything- they got you covered.FOOD/DRINK:*caesar salad (10/10) - this was our app and it was amazing!! i honestly haven't had a better caesar before. fresh and flavorful.*chilean sea bass (9/10) - it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. tasted even better with a bit of lemon and the onions that were on the side. i did think the asparagus that was served with it were just okay but the mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious!*cheesy bread (7/10) - love the flavor of this bread but was a bit soggy so it was my least favorite out of everything i tried.*pinot noir wine (10/10) - i've never tried a pinot noir before so i have nothing to compare it to, but i loved it! i thought it had a very subtle sweetness to it and would get it again.SERVICE: it was AMAZING! always made sure you were taken care of. super sweet staff!!",0
1662,5292,"I always say, next time I will try something different.  My usual Martini, Cesar salad, cheese bread & petite Famous  Pepper steak .Whether it's a birthday, celebration, lunch, dinner or just out for a good meal, Dal Rae doesn't disappoint.The service is impeccable & food Devine.  Just havingcocktails in the bar would be fun too.  Don't let the Location of the restraunt fool you.  I'm sure it's been kept alive for this many years because of the big companies that were once across the street.The Ford motor plant & Boeing-Northrop AerospaceExecs & engineers were just a few that would be seen crossing the street for lunch.  The old Hollywood Glam Era atmosphere that hasn't changed is what makes this restraunt the gem it is today.",1
1663,5293,"French Onion SoupPepper SteakBombay Gin Martini & the bubbly to celebrate my friends birthday.This is one of  the best ""Rat Pack"" style restaurants left east of Hollywood.   It has unfortunately changed with the times due to bad mannered guests . Today there was a young man wearing his cap backwards while dinning. I wanted to say to him this is not the gym.  This is such a popular place for celebrations or just ladies lunching.",1
1664,5294,"How does this old Hollywood Glam style 5 Star restaurant still exist in a city called Pico Rivera?  Well, across the street before it became a no nonsense shopping center was the Ford Automobile factory  in the early 60s then came an  aerospace plant then  Northrup up until the 80s.  So mainly white collar employees , bosses & mainly engineers lunched here during the work week.Word of mouth is what basically kept it busy for special occasions such as birthdays  & anniversaries.  One of the last restraunts offering Valet parking attendants for all those fancy shmancy imports parked right in front.Since Covid 19 the only seating is in the outdoor patio area.   The masks and face sheilds worn by the servers takes away from the ambiance, but is greatly appreciated by this patron.Customers are to wear face masks upon entering but can remove once seated.   I wish I was in the era whenmen & women had style & dressed up for the occasion.   Seeing a guy wearing shorts, a t-shirt & flip flops was ridiculous. Never would happen  at 21 (NY) . HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME.The meal well worth every nickel.",1
1665,5295,"After living in Pico Rivera for a couple of years I finally made a visit to celebrate a 5 year anniversary.Overall, the staff/vibe was great and the food was very good as well.Bar- Great bartenders and awesome drinks. Had old fashioned's and my wife had Moscow Mule's. Drinks were around $15/drink.Seating- We were able to sit in the main dining area on the other side of the live music. Great seating and comfortable all around. It was definitely packed/busy in there but never felt overpowering with noise.Food- The food was really great but I would do without the peppercorn seasoning. The steak was really good but needed a bit more salt but I think due to the pepper over powering the salt.- Bread service is very good especially the cheesy bread option! Get it!- For sides we had the garlic mash potatoes and regular fries and I highly recommend the mash potatoes.Service- Very friendly and all around great. We were always checked on and constantly had our waters refilled.Parking- Valet only and easy to drop off the car. $6 cost plus tipAll in all we definitely look forward to a future trip. Plus can't beat the 5 minute drive.",0
1666,5296,"If you're looking for classic American cuisine served in a charming and old-school atmosphere, Dal Rae Restaurant is definitely worth a visit.The first thing that struck me about Dal Rae Restaurant was the charming and classic decor. The restaurant has been around since the 1950s and has maintained its old-school vibe, with plush red velvet booths, elegant chandeliers, and a vintage bar area. It's the perfect spot for a special occasion or a romantic dinner. Feels like a place Frank Sinatra or Sammy Davis would have dined at... which adds to the experience.The menu at Dal Rae Restaurant is focused on classic American cuisine, with dishes like prime rib, steak, and seafood taking center stage. The prime rib was a standout, with tender and juicy meat that practically melted in my mouth. The lobster bisque was also excellent, with a rich and creamy broth that was packed with flavor. In addition to the delicious food, the service at Dal Rae Restaurant was also excellent. The staff was attentive and friendly, making sure that everything was just right throughout the meal.Overall, we always have a wonderful experience at Dal Rae. The charming and old-school atmosphere, delicious food, and excellent service all combined to make for a truly enjoyable dining experience. If you're in Pico Rivera and looking for classic American cuisine served in a charming setting, I would definitely recommend giving this 'diamond in the rough' a shot. Enjoy!",0
1667,5297,"So to start this review off, I want to say that the bread was good. Other than that, this was extremely disappointing.The environment was so uncomfortable, I told my fiancé at one point it felt like the place was haunted. It smelt kind of like wet musty carpet.The food was below average. It was actually gross. I normally would have sent back but I was tired and just wanted to get out of there. But the Fillet mignon medallions were disgusting. They were super soggy because all the sauce on and around them. It tasted like I was eating already chewed up steak that they added sauce too. The mushrooms in the sauce were very bad tasting.They brought this cheese bread that was also very soggy and didn't even eat 2 bites.They also make you pay $6 for valet parking, even though they have a massive parking lot.So $48 for one person is a waste of money. If I would have done it over I would have driven a little further away from my hotel to find something of better quality for the money.",1
1668,5298,"Tonight a coworker and I found our way to this steakhouse. We valeted the rental car and headed in after 6pm and no reservation. We were seated quickly then had time to go over the menu. Having never been here before I looked around and saw a good amount of folks here for dinner.He ordered wine and we got the calamari for an appetizer. Delicious! A full ten out of ten. I have an affinity for lobster so I got the cheaper tail and asked for a couple of scallops. Also delicious. My co worker got a filet and a wedge salad. Filet was great, wedge salad presentation was less than desired. Overall his meal, 8 out of 10. We were given sourdough bread, some other bread choices and separately some garlic bread.There was a loud lady close to us... But other than that a wonderful experience. Enjoyed watching them make the table side Caesar salad as well.",0
1669,5299,It was my first time here with my bf. We had reservations on Saturday Sept 17 for 7:30pm. We were celebrating our 1 year anniversary (: we got seated very quickly.We ordered fried calamari as an appetizer. It came with two dipping sauce with a slice of lemon on the side. It was so crispy and delicious. The two sauces paired well (spicy marinara & some sort of tartar sauce )Drinks : i really recommend the pomegranate margarita i didn't like the Paloma as much.For our main course : my bf ordered the NY pepper steak with garlic mashed potatoes & i ordered half filet mignon & half Chilean seabass with garlic mashed potatoes.Can i just saw how phenomenal everything was! The pepper steak was cooked to perfection. Wasn't dry or wasn't too rare. Every bite was full of flavor. The filet mignon was so tender & delicious. But the seabass was the star of the show. Immediately melted in your mouth and it was so buttery the garlic mashed was so garlicy and so fluffy it made me so happy (:The service was amazing. Even the manager himself came to our table to make sure everything was good (: they had live music and it felt very old school. The ambiance felt like you were a part of a community.Will be coming back to try the prime rib(:,0
1670,5300,"Came here to celebrate my husband's birthday.Been here one other time, on this special day we decided to bring our kids to celebrate dad's b-day.Angel out server gave us great recommendations, and was a great very professional server.I ordered the same plate and haven't been disappointed.My favorite dish here is the Sea-bass.We got side dishes, but honestly you don't need them. The plates come with enough side dishes, but they are just okay nothing spectacular. Now the steaks and the service were on point. Also, the drinks were strong, to my liking.There is live music and dancingSome tips: only valet parking, and dressy attire.Also you might run into some celebrities,  like comedian Fluffy  with his entourage.I do have boys who love steaks, and seafood. There are many other steak houses, but the service here is top of the line, you are treated like a celebrity. Lastly,  it is pricy, don't let my bill scare you, I believe we over did it by ordering extra dishes.",0
1671,5301,We've been coming here for years and it never disappoints .  The service to attention best describes this icon,1
1672,5302,Excellent food and great entertainment. The entertainer played sax and wandered around greeting and talking with the patrons. He was a real kick! Our party had a great time.P.S. it's accessible.,0
1673,5303,"Came here to celebrate a close friend's birthday. We made reservations a month in advance. Don't bother requesting a booth, they were not nice about it when I requested one, stating, ""Booths are first come, first serve. We service 431 customers daily and everyone asks for one. Good luck"" was the response. As first-time diners, her tone set a very discouraging  and unfriendly vibe from the beginning...just be friendly about the situation, no need to give an attitude, and I'd understand.Fortunately, the food was chefs kiss. The Steak Diane and the Petite Filet Pepper Steak came highly recommended from frequent patrons we spoke to. Don't let the name fool you...the Petite Filet Pepper Steak was NOT petite by any means. Mashed potatoes (garlic or regular) was super smooth, rich, and decadent. Please please order the cheesy bread, you'll thank me later.My girlfriend ordered the Chilean seabass and could not stop raving about the buttery, flaky sole. Rockefeller oysters - came out piping hot with big morsels however, I think the bacon overpowered the sweet oyster and cheese flavor.I was not expecting the ambiance either. We were seated in the main dining room; a bit dark, low lighting, with dark wooden paneled walls - it gave us an old-school vibe which we loved. Go towards the bathroom and there's the piano bar with live music!Dessert - could be better. We ordered the butter cake. It left much to be desired, especially since we compared it to Mastros'.I'd like to come back for the prime rib as this was also highly recommended.",0
1674,5304,We love this place. The food is always consistent and always amazing. We started out with their favorites the peppered steak and the sea bass. It was good but we wanted to explore other items on the menu. So we also tried the prime rib and rib eye. That was epic! This was through multiple trips from the last few months. The oysters and meat cuts are really fresh. I did try their sausage penne but that could use a little more work. The sausage was a little dry.Our favorite waiter so far is Brandon. He is very personable. He said he's only worked there for a short period of time but you wouldn't be able to tell because he's so knowledgeable about everything. We also love his energy. Thank you so much for taking care of us last night.,0
1675,5305,Dal Rae is always exceptional and never disappoints.  I went there with a party of 8 to celebrate my sister's birthday on a Saturday.  Our server was Brandon and Nick a server in training. They were amazing. Very attentive and friendly. Brandon was very knowledgeable and charming.  He made sure we were welll taken care of and kept the evening fun.  Nick is certainly learning from one of the best.  The food was amazing. I had the Chilean Sea Bass and table side Caesar Salad.  Exquisite.  I personally love the ambience.  We actually learned some great historical facts about the restaurant during the preparation of our salad.  I highly recommend.,0
1676,5306,"I should have wrote this review the moment I left Dal Rae so that I could have given credit where credits was due but I fell into a good coma!My bf and I randomly came here last Saturday around 5pm purely from the Instagram photos my gf Brianna would post on Instagram from time to time from her visits.Our waitress was incredible! She knows her stuff and she made excellent suggestions the whole night.I starting with the Ahi Sashimi on Toast which was so wonderful, we moved onto the main dishes, for myself a Chilean Sea Bass and for him the Veal Chop. It was all truly so delicious!  I'm salivating as I type this review!We shouldn't have but we ordered the butter cake! It's a beautiful thing, incredibly indulgent.. after that it was all a blur. We paid the check and magically made it home!Thanks Dal RaeWe look forward to dinner here again and  again!",0

You will not be disappointed when you visit this restaurant.Once you walk in it will take you back to history and elegance.  Brandon who was are server had to be one of the top 5 amazing servers we ever had.  The timing of the food and how we were treated I can't say enough.  Bravo to Brandon!! The making of the Caesars salad table side was an experience and the food was more than 5 stars.  Thank you to the entire team for an amazing time from start to finish. See you all soon.",0

Our reservation was on a Saturday, so there was a live band playing. Service was exceptional.The food was very delicious and our server brought us a lemon cake on the house since it was my birthday, very thoughtful.We ordered :1. Fresh Oysters : 5/5 - fresh with no fishy aftertaste.2. Chilean Seabass Alla Ben  W/ mash and veggies : 4/5 - fish was perfectly cook, cheese crust was delicious. It was just missing a tiny bit of seasoning.3. Prime New York Cut - W/ baked potato : 4.5/5 Medium rare - steak was cooked perfectly very delicious.4. Creamed Corn au gratin - 3.5/5 - a bit watery5 . Dessert: Gold Brick Sunday : 5/5  - Bomb!Total experience and food I would rate 4.5/5",0
1681,5311,Classic old fashioned place.  Dress up and enjoy great service.  Dimly lit and great live music thurs-sun evenings.Okay thing that could make it better would be filling the place up with smoke =)Highly recommend the calamari and sea bass.Restaurant in the middle of nowhere.  Valet parking $6,1
1682,5312,My husband and I came to celebrate our Anniversary. Good is good but they take forever. Server was nice but I will not be coming back,1
1683,5313,"Another exceptionally special evening at the Dal Rae. From the bar to the table, service is excellent. Tableside Caesar is not to be missed. The relish dish is by request these days which is absolutely fine - still a nice way to start the meal. If you order the Caesar, skip the bread service because the cheese bread that is served with the salad is so good! Two at our table had the 10 oz prime rib which looked amazing, one had the veal osso buco - a beautiful presentation with a marrow spoon included! I had the Chilean Sea Bass a la Ben. How I wish I could make that at home - I would eat it daily. The thing I like the best is that the Dal Rae is consistently a wonderful experience - we save it for our special occasions and they always deliver. Note - do not skip the butter cake! It is new to the menu in the last two years. The four of us shared it and collectively agreed that it could possibly be the best dessert ever. Also note - when you have three wine drinkers with different tastes, it is nice to be able to order good quality wines by the glass from in and out of California. I've been coming to the Dal Rae since I was a kid and the fact that it is consistently an amazing meal means a great deal to me.Thank you for making our anniversary dinner so special.",0
1684,5314,"Bottom line:  Dal Rae never disappoints.  My husband took my mom, daughter and me for dinner the night before Mother's Day.  They offered a special Mother's Day menu which although was smaller than their normal menu, it offered a wide variety of choices.  We started with drinks and the traditional Dal Rae crudite platter.  Mom and my kid had Shirley Temples and I had a perfect French 75.  We had the salad with the traditional house dressing which is a 1000 with an anchovy base.  It is served with cheese bread.  It is the sole reason my mom LOVES Dal Rae.  Many years ago, the owner was kind enough to give her the recipe.  Mom and my husband each had the prime rib which overflowed the plate.  Both enjoyed their meals immensely and mom had enough to have another meal!  I had the Chilean Sea Bass ala Ben.  It is a 6-7 ounce portion of fish with a Parmesan crust and caramelized onions.  It sits on a sauce and the entire dish is divine.  Last night, the vegetable was perfectly cooked asparagus.  Kiddo had pasta with meat sauce and reported it to be fantastic.  After a meal like that, all but the kiddo passed on dessert.  The service was impeccable - our server was lovely and the bus men were so kind to my disabled mom, gently helping her up after the meal.Always a good time at Dal Rae.",0
1685,5315,This place is awesome. I've been driving past this place for years and finally stopped in for dinner. The food was great. I had the veal osso Bucco. It was so good.Also the all the staff was so friendly and always had a smile on their faces.I definitely will be back soon.,1
1686,5316,"Parking: Paid for valet, I think it was no more than $15?Food: Probably one of my favorite celebratory dining spots now! I'm a huge of ""surf and turf"" menus - they served great medium rare filets and also the best ahi tuna appetizer I've ever had. I really appreciate that they placed crushed chips on the bottom, it really made eating it so seamless and convenient. I highly recommend the calamari (lemon butter sauce was amazing) for another appetizer and the carbonara for a side to share among the table! Everything was super filling and we brought so many leftovers home.Ambiance/Service: Super dark and intimate setting inside. I has no expectations upon arriving since it's not a super heavily advertised restaurant, but I was blown away by the interior. I would definitely come back for another celebratory meal. Our waitress and servers were so kind and accommodating. We  were seated as a family of 6 and we tend to request a lot of plates/drinks/sauces etc. so I really appreciated the kindness from the staff.",0
1687,5317,Awesome restaurant.Amazing stake.The lobster bisque on Thursday is a must.The staff always friendly,1
1688,5318,Excellent restaurant.We always enjoy coming here for a lunch meal.The waiter is always attentive.,1
1689,5319,Service was outstanding as always. We both ordered the Chilean Sea Bass alla Ben. Plus I got a Diet Coke $132 before the tip. Worth the drive and every penny. Yes! Also they are already decorated for Christmas there. I always order the same sea bass dish. Best thing on the menu. Also be sure to ask for the cheesy garlic bread. It is delicious. Valet parking only at $6 .......what a treat. My favorite place to eat fish in Southern California. Run don't walk.,0
1690,5320,Met some friends here for dinner on a Saturday night and it was busy! They only have valet parking so just pull in and go.You need reservations unless your willing to wait and catch an open seat at the bar. The staff is very friendly and approachable.We got in early so we hung out at the bar and ended up getting seated earlier than our reservation. Also they have  an area for private parties if you're wondering.We got seated and were greeted with our waiter soon as we settled in. Very attentive and they also have the manager walking around and checking in. You can bring your own wine so you just pay for the cork fee which was $25 in my opinion maybe a little steep. Ordered the Surf and Turf which is the only pic I took for this review because it was gone in mins!Definitely coming back! Thank you!,0
1691,5321,"We went for  our 36th wedding anniversaryThe food and service were top notch . We had the Prime Rib , Filet Mignon and Lobster Tail . Rene and Danielle were the best . Thank you so much .",0
1692,5322,"For Easter Sunday, I was surprised to see Dal Rae with availability on Open Table, so the family and I jumped on the opportunity to go there for lunch. We did not regret it, in fact, it was probably the best dining experience I've had in the 40 years I've been going to Dal Rae. The restaurant was not packed, as it usually is in the evenings. We were immediately seated in the beautiful, lush garden patio when we arrived and noticed every table was empty, which was perfect for a family with small kids.I'm not much of a fun of the live entertainment they have there because it tends to be loud and doesn't seem to fit the vibe, the way Marty and Elaine were able to ooze coolness at the Dresden Room for so many years. But this time, the hits were rolling in the background, from early Sinatra, Rat Pack songs taken from their live shows, to Harry Connick Jr. My wife and I loved it, and mind you, we're in our 40's.Now to the food. The veggie tray used to be complimentary, but for $5, my wife said it's a tradition and well worth it. If you've never tried it, do as the French do and put butter on the radishes. You gotta always have the Caesar Salad, served table side. Dal Rae has the best! I ordered the Lobster Thermidor, which I hadn't ordered in years because I would usually order the pepper steak. I really enjoyed the flavors and managed to finish it all. We also ordered salmon and a kids' shrimp meal. The shrimp were colossal, but the fries were not up to Dal Rae standards. For dessert, we had to order the chocolate soufflé, another tradition we have.To summarize, service was excellent, ambiance never better, and the meal was very good. I think I'm going to start going to Dal Rae for lunch more often.",0
1693,5323,"The holiday ambience was nice with the lights and decor but it was wayyy too crowded. They tried to fit too many tables into not enough space. Since there were more people, it was quite loud and not enough arm room, it was hard to converse and made the place feel less classy for sure. We ordered the escargot for apps, not bad. Their signature filet mignon pepper steak is tender, but the ribeye and pepper new york prime weren't that impressive. Tiramisu for dessert was just ok, I've definitely had better. Service was pretty slow, our server didn't know much about the wines either. Frankly, I wasn't too impressed for a restaurant that boasts three $$$.",1
1694,5324,"I was so engaged and captured by the atmosphere of the Dal Rae, I didn't take the pics I wanted for a great review!Wow! Where to begin... First, I grew up in Pico Rivera and passed by the Dal Rae for 25 years straight and never bothered to stop. I think I took it for granted that it was just right there- and it was in my hometown of Pico so ""how special could it be?"" Well I'll never make the presumptive mistake again! This place is AH-MAZING.Right when you walk in, you immediately are hit with the buzzing and vibrant atmosphere that a Saturday night with live music and 2 fully stocked oval bars has to offer. It feels like a scene straight out of a movie... Goodfella's to be exact. We checked in with the host for our reservation (highly recommended) and were told it would be a few minutes- so we went straight for the bar! We ordered our drinks with the very attentive bar tenders, and they did not disappoint with the pour.We were seated soon after in the corner booth, and were served with their delicious sour dough bread basket and butter. It was off to a great start! I ordered the MUST HAVE table side Cesar salad for 4 people (I think that's 2 orders since each order accommodates 2 people). The landmines of anchovy were a burst of flavor. It was great. We ordered the famous pepper steak mignon, Prime Rib, Chilean Sea Bass, and Bone in rib eye steak. Everything was decadent and delicious. I could not believe my taste buds! We didn't stop there. For dessert, we ordered a slice of cheesecake, butter cake, and lemon cake. DO NOT LEAVE without having dessert ! You won't be disappointed.All in all... I must say that I am super impressed with the Dal Rae, especially since the ambience is very classic and exactly what you would expect with going to a steak house. I'm not into the Las Vegas club feel M*stro's has. Not to mention this is in my front yard basically! A must try !",0

Vodka, Gin N Tonic, Wine.  Yep. No flaws just good food.",0
1703,5333,One of my all time favorite restaurants.    This is old school dining that makes you want to get dressed up.  I've been eating at this establishment since the mid sixties and every visit is a treat.   Ask for the hearts of romaine salad with the old style dressing.  Wow!  If your a steak fan then their famous pepper steak is the way to go.   Equally delicious is everything else including excellent cocktails.    Bon Appetit.,0
1704,5334,"If you are looking for fine dining, Dal Rae won't embarrass you.Be it steak, prime rib, or fish - Dal Rae doesn't disappoint.The ambiance is nice - it's catered to fine foodies who make an effort to call ahead of time so be sure to make reservations otherwise you'll likely be waiting ... for a long time.Wine selection is nice too.Be prepared to spend $$$ - the menu isn't cheap but neither is the food.Solid 4 out of 5.",0
1705,5335,"Though emailing is still the only method of communication to inquire about private rooms, I recently ate here and theres no change in the flavors and quality of their food.  Updated them with 3 stars",1
1706,5336,"Inquired about a private room and the event coordinator ONLY communicates by email. How can a restaurant only conduct business by email? Not good business practice and stresses out the actual staff doing the real work.It's unfortunate it's the only ""nice"" restaurant around that area.",1
1707,5337,"This place is more for nostalgia than the quality.  Granted we did not have their special dishes.  César salad made at the table is overblown.  Our lettuce wedge was dumped.. I mean dumped with  glob of bleu cheese dressing. It was so glumpy.  It was an over kill.  The tuna sashimi on a toast was ok.. just spinich kale green salad mix chopped on a toast w cream cheese? and a slice of tuna sashimi.  A place like DalRae to provide fakw soy sauce (the one that has caramel color added .) was not what expected, nor the fake wasabi paste.OsoBucco was good over a bed of tomatoe based pasta. Nothing to write home about.The complimentary basket of bread was cool to cold, even if they say it's seeved at a room temperature.   I asked for a fresh batch and boy! were they nice and warm and fresh!They did not acknowledge our special occasion even it was mentioned when making reservation.The best part...  we were seated.  Noone came to see us for over 15+ minutes AND the waiter...  smacking on gum!!!!!!!!Done the DalRae experience.  Will I go back! Oh no......  I rather seek somewhere brighter in ambience and more up to date in food and food appearance.",1
1708,5338,"The Dal Rae is as much a part of Southern California history as LA's City Hall or the Hollywood sign. It's been around since the days of Sinatra and Marilyn. Now, they may not necessarily have been patrons, but it wouldn't surprise me if they were.The dimly lit interior and booths that rim the interior could have been stripped from a scene in LA Confidential. A part of me imagines what it would have been like to walk into the smoke filled restaurant in the 50s with my wolf pack and order a stiff drink at the piano bar. Would have been pretty cool.Yesterday, however, I left the fedora at home. The old-fashioneds, Oysters Rockefeller and bone-in ribeye did not disappoint. Classic Steakhouse fare served the way its been done for half a century. The service is also old-school... Friendly and attentive.Definitely earns 5 stars in my book.",0
1709,5339,"The ribeye was mouth watering. Everything was good. The service was amazing. This was for dinner. I had lunch there some years ago and wasn't that impressed. But party of four, for dinner, Highly Recommend.",1
1710,5340,"Had an all around great experience here celebrating my boyfriends birthday. We made reservations for 2 at 6pm. Table was ready at 6:20, but we were able to sit at the bar and order a couple drinks while we waited. We ordered 2 appetizers and two steak entrees. Wow! Every single thing was amazing. Highly recommend the peppered filet mignon. The staff do a great job of making us feel taken care of by checking on us through our meal. I'm glad I finally got to try a local staple and can't wait to return.",0
1711,5341,"We were celebrating a 40th wedding anniversary and we're seated in the banquet room. If you have a party over 8 that is where you will be seated.Extremely noisy, unable to enjoy conversation with those in our group.  Very disappointed!!!Not rushing back.",1
1712,5342,Hadn't been here in a while because the last couple of experiences we had weren't that great but this time I'm happy to say they nailed it! Our server was Javier and he could not of been more polite! Our drinks came out on point. I got the Chilean sea bass which just melted in my mouth and my husband had the filet. The Caesar salad is the bomb! Everything was delicious! Our waiter Javier was efficient and the service was excellent!,0
1713,5343,The salads are very big enough for 2/4 peopleThe service is always greatThe food is very goodDesert is the only way to Finnish off a great meal,1
1714,5344,I specifically came to Downey California tonight to try this restaurant. I was looking for an old school steakhouse restaurant with a great vibe and phenomenal service. Let me tell you this place exceeded my expectations. The food was outstanding. We enjoyed exceptional oysters as an appetizer and the absolute very best Caesar salad I've ever had in my life made right before me at my table. Our entrées were delicious and consistent. I highly recommend the prime rib because you will not be disappointed.However the best part of the whole experience had to have been the outstanding service we received. Every employee there made us feel valued and welcomed. Different hosts managers and servers checked on us and made us feel like VIPs.This place is a special place and I am so glad we went out of our way to diner tonight and I look forward to returning soon!,0
1715,5345,"My husband and I had dinner last night at the 'Del Rae' and we had the best meal and the service on point. It was my birthday so they made sure to make it more special for us!  Oh, and can I tell you the Cesar salad table side ?,  was a hit, fresh!!The ambiance was nice, the lighting just dim enough, it's nice to go out and dress up now and again instead of hitting the Irish pubs every St. Patrick's Day!  This place was packed and the corned beef and cabbage so tender and flavorful",0
1716,5346,Really great ambience and super tasty food make a beautiful harmony.Thankfully the service was just as impeccable.You have to try their Cesar salad.  Especially if you enjoy authentic ingredients.  That garlic and anchovie....so worth it.The main courses were just as great.  My filet didn't melt in my mouth like other steak places but the flavors were on point.  I might try the unpeppered version and see if the meat was more tender.  The prime rib was quite good though.Drinks were strong and that cheddar toast.  I could eat a trough full of that stuff.  The GM came to us and suggested coming during lunch for the Monte Cristo and the Reuben.  Definitely gonna have to return.,0
1717,5347,"Went last night ordered steak and drinks, service was good by our server food was good, But they sat us in the overflow room or banquet room which was not the best setting for our event ,everything was going until we see a homeless man sneak in the back room through the kitchen then he blinked for the restroom and locked himself in a stall. Plus the extremely bright banquet room kind ruined the experience from sitting in the regular restaurant side. We took a group of first timer they were not impressed with that room.So make sure you make notes when you book through Open Table not to sit you in the AARP section with the folding picnic tables.The staff did a great job of handling the situation I was really impressed.",0
1718,5348,The food has always been good with excellent service. The restaurant itself was nice and elegant. I had the Filet Mignon and it was seasoned very well and cooked just right. The Chocolate cake is very good too! I will definitely be coming back with more family to share in all the goodness.,0
1719,5349,"I actually came across this restaurant on OpenTable as I was trying to find a location to have dinner with friends. What drew me was the history and the classy vibe it gave off. We were seated right away and thankfully got seated in the main dining room which has all the cool old school decor and vibes (I think they also seat people in the generic banquet rooms which are brighter and not as cool).We ordered drinks and i was a little disappointed with the Old Fashioned I ordered, you'd think a classy place like this would serve it with a sphere or cube of ice but it was regular ice which watered it down rather quickly. As far as the food, I had the peppered filet. I ordered it medium but the cut was a little tough. The vegetable side was 3 asparagus and a slice of bell pepper; got the mashed potatoes and they were a bit too puréed for my taste.Over all I gave the 4 stars for the experience, it was cool to have dinner in a place that had preserved history so well. Also side note, the price for the steak varied about $10+ from what was on the menu vs the receipt we got at the end of the night.",0
1720,5350,"Love this restaurant!  Very busy, awesome vibe. The live piano music greatly helped set a nice ambiance last night (5/10/23)",1
1721,5351,"Went here with my HS buddies from Covina. Like any good restaurant they don't rush you, plenty of time for decisions and between courses.Marissa took care of us and did a stellar job. She was smart and did not refrain from engaging in witty banter with us.The food was great: I had the specialty of the house pepper filet mignon, my friend had the filet and lobster, my other had the NY.Surprised we weren't served the crudite plate but we all ordered salads so moot. We didn't ask as we were satiated vegetable wise.We were stuffed but Marissa suggested the butter cake a la mode. We all agreed it was one of the best things we have ever tasted.Great experience!!",0
1722,5352,"First time coming, simply perfect. The food was amazing and worth what you do are paying for. However it wasn't just the food that was amazing but the service and the environment. Our server was constantly asking if we needed anything and would be there right when we needed her. The music and vibe are just right. Perfect all around",1
1723,5353,"First time at Del Rae, and definitely coming back!The service was amazing, all the staff was attentive. The bar area was a bit difficult to get service, but it's common for a busy bar area. Bartender was great.The dining area staff constantly watching your needs from afar to not disturb your dining. Food was great!!!!The steaks delicious. I got the Parmesan Chicken and it was very flavor and cooked perfectly (unexpected deliciousness from a steak house) and its currently my favorite thereDefinitely coming back.",0
1724,5354,"My husband and I had one of the best meals in Southern California here. The oysters Rockefella were great and the scallops simply delicious. The table side Caesar salad was over the top.We loved the veal chop and chilean sea-bass.Our waiter Derrick was great, so happy we had him serve us.We highly recommend this restaurant!",0
1725,5355,"One of my friends recommended this place as a great steakhouse to try. He told me it's better than the cut and less expensive.I tried this place for my birthday and thought it was great. The customer service was spectacular. I went to another fine dining previously and was a little ignored. They started the meal by giving us cucumbers and peppers which we thought was weird. They also gave fresh bread and butter. We ordered the Caesar salad for two, crab cake, pepper steak, and sea bass. The entrees came with a side. I got garlic mashed potatoes and my friend got a baked potato. The Caesar was great, and a big portion for $26. Although my friend said when she had it, they gave her fresh sardines. The crab cake tasted much of crabs and less cake. They also gave more garlic bread which was delicious.The pepper steak was flavorful and really great tasting. The sea bass was really great tasting. All in all the food was great, and I would definitely come back. The service was superb.",0
1726,5356,"The Dal Rae is one of our favorite restaurants. I can order some oysters, French onion soup and perfectly happy.  I also absolutely love the ice cream, berries and caramel tuile for dessert. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone I know. Everything on the menu is amazing.",1
1727,5357,"This is an easy 5 star restaurant. I've had the bone in prime rib, the crab cakes , Caesar salad, chocolate cake - everything there is extremely delicious. They have a great staff that is very attentive and helpful. Make a reservation in advance because it's constantly packed.",0
1728,5358,"This place is super delicious. I've had the prime rib and the New York steak here. I liked the prime rib better. It had a salty balance to match the fat and richness of the meat. Really excellently delicious. I also had the Caesar salad. It is a special dish there and is made at the table. Also very delicious. The crab cakes were also extremely good as well. I strongly recommend this place. Also, very attentive and thoughtful service.",0
1729,5359,2 star because of the parking situation!Staff is amazing! 5 stars!Food 4.5 stars!Ambiance 4.5 stars!Took a new customer an his crew of 6 an it would have been over the top amazing other than the massive parking cluster!Obviously Dal Rae is ok with the process because we are not the only ones complaining about it!,1
1730,5360,"Went here for lunch-good food, great wait staff, anchored by some amazing attention to detail OG busers!Place has the ambiance an ol school steakhouse feel. Like if look hard enough back in one of dem corners sat Joe Pesci, Robert De Niro, & Al Pacino....just a really smooth place!Gotta go back for supper!Pay attention when your here this has some legit regulars that know how to make money!",0
1731,5361,"Go for the chopped salad stay for the pepper steak, Chilean sea bass or prime rib but don't overeat on the delicious garlic cheese bread cause you need room for cheesecake or my favorite, the gold brick sundae!",0
1732,5362,"My husband and I have been going to this restaurant for over 25 + years and my company holds our annual Christmas dinners here for over 30 yrs as the food is fantastic and we've tried everything on the menu! The service is great but our compliments go to Carrie who has been our server by request every time we go! Not only does she know what we enjoy eating most but when she recommends something different, she is spot on! My latest favorite is the Chilean sea bass a la Ben my husband will choose the prime rib every time! The chopped salad can be split and is a must have! Thanks Carrie!! Thanks Dal Rey!",0
1733,5363,We went to Dal Rae for the first time with our good friends who have been there before. We had a fabulous time there. The salmon was one of the best we have ever eaten. Aside from the amazing food we had the most wonderful time with our server Olivia. She was ON IT!!! So prompt and friendly and so sweet! We highly recommend for you to dine here and ask for Olivia. She surprised us to say that she just got off training two weeks ago! Kudos to the one that trained her!! Great Job!!The manager... whose name I can't remember (I'm racking my brain) was also very nice. He informed us that Del Rea has been around since 1958 HIGHLY RECOMMEND and we will be back!!!!,0
1734,5364,"Love this place!!  It there were 10 stars, they deserve it.  The food, the ambiance, the drinks,, the service...  Excelente!!",1
1735,5365,Our Company's get-together was a big success! We all enjoyed ourselves very much. Brandon our server did a great job hosting. He went above and above for our executive team to ensure that everyone was taken care of at dinner. Working with Dal Rae Team was a great process.,0
1736,5366,"The last old school Continental dinner house we know. What a wonderful restaurant with warm, professional service and absolutely delicious meals! It's so civilized to get a Caesar or spinach salad made table side by someone who knows what they're doing! Please frequent this place to keep it in business, and please also do us all a favor and dress for the occasion - nobody wants to see people dining in t-shirts and ball caps. Thank you!",0
1737,5367,We have been dining at the Dal Rae for 30+years now. We were just there this past weekend celebrating my dads birthday and again another fabulous dining experience. Every single time we go there it is AMAZING! The service is always impeccable and we had the best booth in the dining room. Everything was DELISH!!!,0
1738,5368,"Dinner was delicious!  Brandon, our waiter, was charming and attentive.  He responded to every request with a smile and genuine concern to ensure our dining experience was not only enjoyable but also memorable.  His trainee, Nicholas made sure to fill in the gaps so that there was very little wait time for drinks to appear at our table. The classic setting of the Dal Rae is a reminder of the elegance of the dining experiences of old.  It was an expensive meal to be sure, but well worth it!",0
1739,5369,"Well, we just left a nearly $2K New Year's Eve dinner at the Dal Rae. We made reservations by phone about a month and a half ago and we were not informed that it would be a $135pp pre fix menu. Holy moly! With a party of 13 we all looked at each other with shock as we realized it was either go along with it and bust out our savings or get up and have nowhere to eat. The 1 star goes for the ambiance of beautiful decor.We went ahead and ordered a round of drinks to help us get over the fact that we were about to spend way more on this meal than expected. The bread service was nice, as was our server Lou, who seemed to have little sympathy for us that we did not know about the fixed price. We ordered a few appetizers. My aunt ordered a shrimp cocktail, which came with 3 shrimp, and my dad ordered one as well, which came with 4 shrimp. This caused great confusion. My brother's girlfriend is a vegetarian, and she suffered greatly as her meal became the center of attention several times with no choices on the fixed menu that met her dietary needs. The server came back about 4 Times asking her about how she wanted her veggies cooked and what veggies to bring out. Very awkward.Wedge salads were sloppy with glops of dressing and undercooked bacon. Clam chowder was watery. The food runners called out who ordered what, which does not add up with the price we were paying for this meal. Seat numbers should be used so there is no question of who ordered what. Steaks and prime rib were good, but nothing to write home about. Highlight was the crab legs which cost an extra $30 on top of the $135. The desserts were sub par, including a pecan pie my husband gagged down so as not to complain given the price. My sister's crème brûlée had a crumble of blue cheese on it.We made lots of jokes about hoarding the bread and taking toilet paper home to get our money's worth. Worst of all when we got the bill, and finally had it worked out, the math was incorrect on the server's end leading to an awkward exchange.Oy vey! What was supposed to be a great night out with family turned into a nightmare! We would have absolutely benefited from knowing there was a set menu. How horrid that no one informed us in advance. We will NEVER be back and wouldn't wish this experience on our enemies. At least we had a few laughs. ‍ Disappointing.",1
1740,5370,"This restaurant was a wonderful experience. It opened back in the '50s and has become an L.A. institution. We arrived slightly before our reservation for 6:30, and didn't have to wait long for our table to be ready.We started off with drinks, a Dark N Stormy Night for me, and a Rodney Strong Merlot for my girlfriend. For an appetizer, we got the Crab Cake which was probably one of the best I've ever had. For our mains, she got the Chilean Sea bass Alla Ben with a Parmesan crust, sautéed onions and lemon butter. Wow, what a dish, especially if you're a seafood lover like we are. I got the large Filet Mignon which came topped with onions and was cooked perfectly. We also got some sides, including the Mac & cheese, creamed spinach and a baked potato, which the waitress prepared right at the table. Somehow we managed dessert, which consisted of an Apple Tart and a piece of chocolate cake called Chocolate Temptation. Both were simply amazing.I can't say enough about the staff, who were all so friendly and attentive. Even the manager was checking in on tables to make sure everyone was satisfied. We can't wait to come back.",1
1741,5371,Love this place! A true hidden gem. You don't have to drive all the way downtown to get an excellent steak dinner and table side Caesar Salad. This old school looking restaurant will take you back to the Goodfellas time and enjoy a great martini. You can almost smell the old school cigarette smoke it's that classic.,1
1742,5372,Great old school atmosphere. Went for lunch and food was excellent. Definately going back for dinner.,1
1743,5373,"Old people, old vibes, bad smell, needs a life line all of my attorneys come here out of convenience not luxury!",0
1744,5374,"So I am not a regular there but the impeccable service is still given to all.  3 of us had reservations, sat in a booth, it was lunch time.  It was pretty crowded but everything seemed to be running like clockwork.   Two of us ordered the filet with their pepper sauce, one ordered a prime rib.  They came with mashed potatoes and asparagus.This where I want to divert and praise our waitress , Julie.  After the two ladies  were finished with their french onion soup, our food arrived and we dug in.  Then two problems occurred.   Neither lady could cut their meat.  I am pigging out as mine was perfect. I was one of the two that had the pepper filet.  We called Julie over. She 100% agreed with us, swept both of their plates away and was going to get new ones.  They  watched as I ate away.  I felt bad but they egged me on to keep going.When Julie returned with two brand new dinners, they dug in.  This time they could have cut the filet with a fork the prime rib cut was amazing.  As soon as they dug in the smiles returned.  One lady cleaned her plate, the other one had some to take home.So 5 stars because the food was as awesome as it always is,  and Julie made sure we left happy.  This is an old school type steakhouse with that vibe but they serve almost everything.  Valet parking only.",0
1745,5375,"I'm giving 2 stars because of the decorations and the food overall, but beyond that, it has gone downhill and won't be our place to go for special occasions anymore.There was a leak in the ceiling dripping on my brother-in-law and his seat and instead of moving us to an empty corner booth we asked about, the owner/manager had our table smashed up to other people who jokingly asked me to pass the butter we were so close. We kept getting bumped by everyone walking by, too. We made reservations over a month ago and I called to ensure we'd have a comfortable table for a party of 5 and was told not to worry. Seems we weren't important enough to merit the precious booth.Service was lacking - the waitress was inept and had too many tables, she forgot things, took forever to get drinks, dinner was very late arriving, food was cold, items were incorrect, etc. We wanted a dining experience and weren't in a rush, so we put up with it and understood they were busy. The Caesar salad had some slimy blobs so I didn't eat it most of it. They charge for the relish tray now and the items in it were either soggy or frozen. My husband's rib eye was cold and rubbery. My shrimp scampi was good, at least, and my dad enjoyed his duck and my sister liked her filet.So after being there several hours, tolerating the leaking ceiling, cramped table and awkwardly slow service, plus paying several hundred dollars - we were told we had to leave right now because they needed the space. We said something to the hostess on the way out who got defensive and said it wasn't her fault - we said we knew that, but we're asking her to tell the owners, duh. The lobby area was flooded with people when we left and they obviously overbooked their reservations. That's not our fault and we won't be back.",0
1746,5376,"It's really hard to compare the Dal Rae to other steakhouses in Southern California (or anywhere really).  The food, the service, the history, the table-side items...everything is on point.  My wife and I have been to this restaurant many times over the last 10 years and it never fails to deliver!",0
1747,5377,"Ok. So the place is retro and has a good vibe. Dimly lit, great staff and friendly environment. As far as food is concerned, very tasty, but for the price, I've had equal or better. The drinks are marginal and very expensive. They do not use top shelf alcohol unless you ask but then your drink is gonna be pretty pricey. For my wife and I , it was a one and done. I'm glad I tried it but won't be back.",1
1748,5378,"Unbelievable experience tonight at the Dal Rae. Service is taken seriously, which is rare these days. From Marco to Javier, Gabriel to Lorin, we felt appreciated as customers! The food is top notch. Crab claws were tasty. Sea bass was out of this world. Ribeye was exceptional. Thank you for going the extra mile. We will return!",0
1749,5379,"This review is long over due. I love this place! It reminds me of a exclusive classy restaurant with a retro vibe. We've been her before for dinner and although I can't remember what I had exactly our wine sommelier created a table side so it was a great experience. This time we had bar seats and just ate light with some appetizers, drinks and dessert. The lemon fluke and butter cake was absolutely amazing. The jumbo prawn cocktails and fried zucchini was a hit. We enjoyed the light music and ambiance with a couple of drinks including a watermelon basil martini, pomegranate martini and margarita.",0
1750,5380,"It's not Mastros or Capital Grill but it has its own distinct class of fine dining...off Rosemead of all places. Great dinner atmosphere so dress business casual. Has great menu and cocktails. The scallops were pretty awesome as was the chicken Parmesan which the chicken was so tender it cut through effortlessly ...cocktails are pretty pricey so not a place to drink much. Service is somewhat ok just because they were pretty busy on a Friday night when we went after 8pm but the servers complete prepping your entree before your eyes...like the sommelier who prepped our Caesar salad, which was great...  seating is pretty tight so get a booth. I prefer dinner with friends and adults and when we visited I didn't see children which made the atmosphere a little more relaxing.",0
1751,5381,Wow today was my first RUDE experience I had here!Ran in for a couple of gift cards and Kelly supposedly ran my card and said it was declined!  I asked her to please run it again because I'm sure there were funds. She refused and insisted for cash or another card. It was very embarrassing for me!  I have been coming here with my family for twenty years. She could have at least been more gentle and less demanding.Soon as I left I called my bank and it appears that no attempt was made to run my card. I should have waited for Marcy as I know for a fact she would not have made me feel so small!  I hope the brothers talk with her about being nice to EVERY customer. Even the ones just running in for gift cards!,0
1752,5382,"My boss took me here when I didnt get the raise I was expecting LOL. This place is vintage steakhouse, its like stepping in a time warp! Beautiful bar (wish I could have ordered a drink!) and the service was great. We went for lunch and this place was poppin, super busy, kinda middle of nowhere in an industrial area. I ordered the small filet. It was nice. I really want to come back at night and sit at the bar. They have a piano for the evening most likely. Look forward to coming back!",0

If you don't have the cash, they take card!!!I checked in with the hostess, who took down my number to message me when our table was ready and then to the bar  The Bartender was making drinks with very heavy pours, which eventually led to a super heavy tip $$If you're ever at the bar and have some time to order the Brie, you won't go wrong, and boy, it's Fabulous  Once everyone arrived, we had a few mote drinks, then was notified the table was ready and headed over to be seated...Main courses were ordered  Seabass, South African Lobster Tail, Bone-in Ribeye, Salmon, Pepper Steak, and the Filet were just a few plus sides...Our Waiter was on point and was sling drinks and food like no other.

1754,5384,"Had the filet stroganoff for lunch.  I didn't read what noodles they would use for the dish but one would assume egg noodles for a stroganoff.  Nope.....wrong.   They used penne pasta.   Different.   Honestly....for the first time I was disappointed with my meal at the Del.   Also, the ""stroganoff"" sauce is not stroganoff sauce.....it sounds like the filet medallion's concoction.   Strange.   Also, service was subpar.  Waitress forgot I had ordered a salad.  Disappointing lunch.",1
1755,5385,"Offering ""the best steaks in Pico Rivera"" since 1958, the Dal Rae is So Cal's middle finger to Las Vegas.  This steakhouse retains the old-fashioned, black-booths-and-white-tablecloths look that made it such a hit with Rat Pack stars and east coast mobsters alike.The restaurant isn't reinventing itself as much it's being discovered by hipsters that care more about optics than the food.Sometimes a buzzed-about restaurant is worthy of critical praise; often it attracts the worst of the worst.While the glory days of the Prohibition era may be long gone, that doesn't mean you can't still party like a gangster.  It's no secret that the wise guys were heavy drinkers and Dal Rae's bar is serving up old school cocktails that would make Capone a regular.  Heavy pours and hand-crafted is the order of the day. Legit drinks keep Uber drivers close by for those who keep bar tabs open.The menu has classic continental dishes that will please even the most ardent critic. When it comes to transforming a restaurant meal into an event, there is nothing like a well-executed tableside preparation of a house specialty.At your table, the server will whip up the freshest Caesar salad you've ever tasted from crisp, grated romaine hearts and Parmesan Reggiano cheese, lemon, minced garlic, anchovies, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, an egg, homemade croutons and cracked black pepper.Chops, steaks, and seafood are all good quality and served at the temperature requested.  The interior is dark with lots of wood and big-ass booths. Walls are covered with enough smoked mirrors to keep your head from turning to see how hot the ladies dining in the booth behind you are.L.A. City politicians were recently involved in one of the most  significant saga of political and public corruption. Their discerning palates do not discriminate against out-of town eateries. Find them feasting at the Dal Rae receiving payments from shady businessmen while seated in a corner booth using their napkins to conceal the cash.",1
1756,5386,"Imagine you love Hollywood and Vegas of the 50s and 60s. Now imagine you love drinking and dining on bona fides.  This restaurant, with its decidedly 1950s motif, will take you back to the rat pack days of martini fueled evenings.The menu boasts plenty of old school Continental faves: Oscars, Thermadors and Dianes, Rockefellers and Paillards.  Tableside service abounds and crudité on cracked ice gets the party started.Rub shoulders in the piano bar with corrupt politicians and their sexy ""assistants"" at a place where everybody drinks and smokes and all the cars in the parking lot have limosine tint on the windows.",1
1757,5387,"everything was so good, from the food to service to the drinks. perfect to come alone or with friends, it's a friendly place overall and highly recommend when you want a really good steak and drink",1
1758,5388,"Delicious meal in the southeast. Drove from West LA because I had read many positive reviews about this place and honestly I feel that it lived up to the hype, it was very good.  I never go to this area so the restaurant alone brought me in and would bring me back again.  They only do valet parking for dinner which is $6 so be prepared for that.  It's no surprise it's been open since 1958 good food is good food.  Our server Liz was very polite and prompt; she did a great job. Also big bonus that the inside is dressed up for the holiday season and Christmas lights are all over. Reminded me of stars I really liked it.I started off with the tomatoes and Maui onions which was covered in blue cheese. YES. A delicious dish and Liz mentioned it's been a favorite for many years.  Very light and strong in flavor. For my entree I chose the Chilean Sea Bass. At first I was dubious bc it is $52 which is $10 more than CSB at most other locations but once I saw the size of the filet and tasted the flavor I was ok with the price. It had a Parmesan crust topping and was buttery but not too much; it was honestly a delicious dish. Added a baked potato side and Liz mixed it up and made it right there for me and it was a perfect side to it, deliciously whipped with butter.  I also tried the French onion soup as it's a personal fav of mine and enjoyed it very much as well.Overall i would recommend to anyone on any occasion. Even though the area is not my preference it's still worth the drive for this delicious food and great service.",0
1759,5389,"For Easter Sunday, I was surprised to see Dal Rae with availability on Open Table, so the family and I jumped on the opportunity to go there for lunch. We did not regret it, in fact, it was probably the best dining experience I've had in the 40 years I've been going to Dal Rae. The restaurant was not packed , as it usually is in the evenings. We were immediately seated in the beautiful, lush garden patio when we arrived and noticed every table was empty, which was perfect for a family with small kids.I'm not much of a fun of the live entertainment they have there because it tends to be loud and doesn't seem to fit the vibe, the way Marty and Elaine were able to ooze coolness at the Dresden Room for so many years. But this time, the hits were rolling in the background, from early Sinatra, Rat Pack songs taken from their live shows, to Harry Connick Jr. My wife and I loved it, and mind you, we're in our 40's.Now to the food. The veggie tray used to be complimentary, but for $5, my wife said it's a tradition and well worth it. If you've never tried it, do as the French do and put butter on the radishes. You gotta always have the Caesar Salad, served table side. Dal Rae has the best! I ordered the Lobster Thermidor, which I hadn't ordered in years because I would usually order the pepper steak. I really enjoyed the flavors and managed to finish it all. We also ordered salmon and a kids' shrimp meal. The shrimp were colossal, but the fries were not up to Dal Rae standards. For dessert, we had to order the chocolate soufflé, another tradition we have.To summarize, service was excellent, ambiance never better, and the meal was very good. I think I'm going to start going to Dal Rae for lunch more often.",0
1760,5390,"The best table side Cesar salad in all of Los Angeles, the service and ambiance is superb. They are so attentive and quick with service. The server allowed my daughter to help with making the table side Cesar salad. I absolutely loved it. I also love the garlic cheese bread it is delicious! They have plenty of wine options my favorite is Rose wine. Every single item on the menu is worth trying.",0
1761,5391,"Thank you for a wonderful & relaxing evening, we've both been running around like stressed out chickens without heads & dinner yesterday (my birthday) at Dal Rae was perfect. A special note of thanks to Olivia, she is very professional & courteous with an added touch of real humanity...she helped make our dining experience just that more pleasant, Kriss",1
1762,5392,"Thank you very much for the lovely ambiance & outstanding food. Our server Eileen was so personable & helpful. The food: out of this world! We were needing a place to de-compress during these crazy time & Del Rae was just the spot! I am going to try to read the history of this restaurant, I know it's been around for a long time & is the favorite of so many people.",0
1763,5393,"Dal Rae , Dal Rae !!!! Can't say enough about the restaurant. 5 star experience from the service to the  to the decor and the food is amazing.  From classics like Steak Diane and bananas foster , to the owners preparing a fresh Cesar table side. Nothing but professional courtesy all around. The bar and drinks are phenomenal.",0
1764,5394,"Talk about Uhmazing food!!!  WOW!!! The oysters Rockefeller are truly the best ever, freshly made Cesar's salad by table side and exquisite filet mignon & wagyu steak. Great bar area to enjoy the ambience with A One customer service by Eric and Richard. And they happen to serve NEFT Ultra-Premium Vodka?!!! What?!! They used it to make a Green Apple Martini and boy is it the bomb!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT so PLEASE give it a try as well as the dinner. Thank you Mark Cilloniz for everything you've done and continue to do. You are one of the many reasons we keep coming back. Cheers!!!",0
1765,5395,"The service was impeccable, unfortunately the food was not what it used to be. The Lobster Thermidor was quite spicy and had more mushrooms than lobster. For what we paid ($600+) it was not the quality that we hav. One to expect from the Dal Rae.",0
1766,5396,"I went to Dal Rae for the first time last night for dinner. We were celebrating my husband's birthday.The food was good and the ambiance inside was nice as well. The live music was nice. Our server was great, but I was a bit disappointed that she didn't sing happy birthday or give my husband a birthday treat (the restaurant told me they would). When I called prior that day, the restaurant confirmed that they were aware this was a birthday celebration. The server even asked us if we were celebrating a special occasion and I let her know it was my husband's birthday. There were other servers singing happy birthday to their table, but we didn't get that kind of service with our server unfortunately.Anyway, we started off with oysters. They were delicious. The starter bread was really good too. They gave a good variety of breads. My husband got the ribeye steak, medium rare. He got it with their famous pepper sauce (bacon, onion, peppercorn, mixture pepper) for only $1.75 more. The cook was good on the steak. I got the seabass. It was nice. We got the baked potato and tomatoes for our choice of side. Everything was good. Surprisingly, we really liked the tomatoes. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese, but that was disappointing. It was kind of basic and under seasoned. It tasted better once we added more salt to it. The cheese had a gritty texture which was weird. I would not recommend the mac n cheese. We finished our meal with a chocolate soufflé. It was delicious...totally recommend it.Overall, we enjoyed our experience at Dal Rae. It's good for the price especially since you get sides with your main entrée.(I gave Dal Rae a 4 star but I think a 4.5 star would be more accurate)",0
1767,5397,Service is always great but food is even better! From the drinks to the table side Cesar salad to the dessert. Always a great experience. Entertainment on Fridays makes it such a fun Friday night date spot. This is our go to spot .,0
1768,5398,"Visited Dal Rae with my family for a birthday celebration and our reservation was at 7:30 p.m on Sunday, 3/26. The hostess was unwelcoming and we waited over an hour to be seated. My mother and I had to check in twice to see when we would be seated. Another party of 5 even arrived after us and they were seated immediately when their reservation was also for the same time. I asked the hostess if my family and I would be seated inside and she condescendingly replied, ""No outside. Look at the reaction of your face,"" as she proceeded to laugh at my question. I hope the manager or owner reads this review and takes it upon themselves to train and improve customer service as it was unacceptable coming from this establishment.",1
1769,5399,"My girlfriends and I have been going here for years. Always delightful. Last night was no exception. Our waitress Jackie was amazing despite being overworked. Our dinners were perfect. I ordered the filet and I like mine rare, when it came there wasn't hardly any pink at all. Asked Jackie to return and replace. Got another one within minutes this time exactly as wanted. We had separate checks and split spinach salad. She even split the price on our checks. Amazing. We had a very leisurely meal and it was a very nice evening. Definitely our go to for special occasions.",0
1770,5400,"We have been customers of the Dal Rae for 46 years, and the quality  never stops. This is my favorite restaruant of all time and I have been yo many.The food is exquisite and the service is outstanding.I love the steaks,  the clam pasta, the Ceasar Salad is to die for.You will never be disappointed. I've move to Oregon and make special flights to visit my all time favorite restatuant.Thank you for the timeless celebrations and memories I will cherish from the times I have visited.You will NEVER BE DISAPPOINTED!  IT'S A VERY SPECIAL  PLACE FOR MAKING MEMORIES.",0
1771,5401,"This is a very dynamic crowd as the lot was filled with cars from Nissan to Rolls Royce. We walked in and the lounge was jam packed and loud. The DJ was yelling out to the crowd and guests were almost yelling to talk to each other. The DJ was singing and had no melody or tone. His voice resounded across the lounge into the dining area. It seemed like an attempt to appear high scale but really felt like cheap entertainment you'd find at a club where they serve bottom shelf vodka cranberries and the DJ is trying to hype up a crowd. Not only was the DJ belting dissonant noises that I guess he thought was singing, but the music choice was so odd. If Dal Rae is going to have live music, I would expect a live band playing jazz or bossa nova, loungy instrumentals, or something tasteful and classy.The Cocktails-Our waitress was nice but clearly very busy and slightly unorganized. We were asked what we wanted to start off with but we did not have a cocktail or wine menu. After asking for those menus, my friend opted for a gin martini, extra extra dirty. My friend asked the waitress which option would be the smoothest gin, however, she did not have any recommendations. While I understand she is not a bartender, for cocktails with a price tag of $17 - $20, I expect the servers to be knowledgeable of their liquors and be able to make recommendations. I asked if their sours are made with egg white because I love an ice cold, well shaken Amaretto Sour, and it also would give me an idea of the caliber of cocktails the restaurant offers. She replied they are not. I opted for a pear martini but was disappointed that the pear was not a fresh fruit, or puree. All the mixers were prepackaged and commercial products. A $17-$20 cocktail should have fresh ingredients, like fresh fruit, in my opinion. My friend's dirty martini was not very dirty as the olive brine flavor was mild. My pear martini had a light pear essence, however the flavor was also mild and tasted watered down. It was an average, at best, prepared cocktail and definitely not worth the cost. Instead of sipping on it for enjoyment, I decided I would drink it quickly to at least enjoy a small, warm buzz, lol, but the buzz never came, indicating to me the liquor ratio was low.Appetizer-We decided on the baked brie, roasted garlic, pesto and toast. We were excited as our imaginations were spreading caramelized, creamy garlic on toast and scooping melty, rich brie on top. What arrived did not fit that gastronomic day dream. I recommend to the chef to modify how the dish is presented because the glob of green, thick pesto, haphazardly topped atop the brie resembled vomit. The toast was overly saturated in oil as my fingers were lined with it. The dish was not aesthetically pleasing but we figured we'd have a taste. We both picked off a few cloves of garlic to spread on our toast as the base, but were unsuccessful. The garlic was undercooked and barely spreadable. I was still able to feel resistance as I pierced my fork through the cloves. The garlic was still sharp with a spicy garlic flavor. The brie was under baked and not melted at all as we could cleanly slice into the block of brie.Entrees-My friend ordered a bone in ribeye for roughly $55. I had the signature peppercorn New York steak for $64. When the plates arrived, the meals were lukewarm at best. It appeared the steaks were cooked and left on the counter, without a heat lamp, and cooled down significantly before being brought out. The asparagus on my plate was so cold I wondered if it was freshly taken out of the refrigerator. My friend's mashed potatoes were so cold he could literally tap on them and make a sound. While my steak was perfectly cooked, I was frustrated that the beautiful (and pricey) cut of steak was served cold. My friend bit into a vegetable that he felt was extremely salty. This was the final straw and we let the waitress know we were not enjoying our meals. My friend was very polite and explained the concerns respectfully and kindly. Sending back food is never comfortable but we wanted to relay the explanations with poise and respect. The manager visited our table shortly after and I immediately felt passive aggressiveness and irritation with us. Without the courtesy of introducing himself, he brusquely asked, ""So what is wrong with the steaks?"" We explained the appetizer was undercooked, each dish was cold and vegetables were unbearably salty. The manager responded with an argument that they outsource their meat from the highest quality beef suppliers. He didn't listen to feedback and was clearly simply waiting to retort. We did offer to pay for drinks and the appetizer but the manager declined stating everything will be comped, which we did appreciate. The cold food and unprofessional approach by the manager was disappointing and uncomfortable.I regret to report our experience at the iconic Dal Rae was anything but iconic.",0
1772,5402,"Wow, where to begin. Everything was amazing. From the food, to the service, to the ambiance, to the drinks. My date ordered the pepper steak and loved it. I got the rib eye cap and it was tender and flavorful. The staff is so knowledgeable and attentive. Definitely recommend for a date night!",0
1773,5403,"Dal Rae is a family owned fine dinning place in Pico Rivera. It is old and it looks old, but it is so well maintained, everything is spotless and the décor is really pretty. Parking is by valet.  Everything is pricey, and for some items a little absurd, but every time we have been there the food has been perfect as has the service.  We love their filet on the bone. It is cooked the way you want it and we like it bloody and they know how to do that. The sides are super yummy. We enjoy their spinach. They have some great seafood as well. We have had lobster and scallops there and they were so good.  The service is just perfect. They take good care of you.You will love this place for a special occasion.",0
1774,5404,"Secured a last minute reservation for a Friday evening dinner, after my parents' friend recommended this place as a regular. Located in Pico Rivera, this restaurant kind of sticks out compared to the surrounding areas of the neighborhood. Valet is $6 during dinnertime and pretty much the only way to find parking unless you want to walk a few blocks.We started off with scallops for appetizer, which is very fresh and soft. Because there are 4 in one order and four of us, they carefully place each scallop in a small dish and served it individually. We got chocolate soufflé for dessert.I shared the famous pepper steak (filet mignon), prime rib, and chilean sea bass alla ben.- Famous pepper steak: lives up to the hype. -0.5 for making it more like a medium/medium-well steak even though I requested it medium-rare. It was still juicy and the green onions and sauce makes the steak stand out compared to other steakhouses.- Prime rib: solid and the ratio of fat to meat is just right. We requested extra juice on the side which they gladly provided, as the juice is only on the plate.- Chilean sea bass alla ben: this is one of the best sea bass I have had; the fish is very flaky and fresh, lightly seared and buttery. It is definitely a heavy dish, but I would highly recommend this if you are not in the mood for red meat (or if you want variety among a group)- Chocolate soufflé: nice that they did a mini show, tearing out the souffle to add chocolate cream (cold) and whipped cream. It was a good conclusion to the meal.While food is at least 4.5 stars, there were a few misses that are not really acceptable for such a high-end restaurant:- They only gave us the regular menu, and no drink menu. They eventually gave it to me when I asked, but did not give me enough time to look at the menu to order (they came back 30 seconds later to ask what I wanted)- My fork was not properly washed. It had chocolate cream on it; no apologies for their mistakeThis should be more of $$$$ for dinner - roughly $320 for four people - but it is a once in a while thing because I typically only visit home twice a year.",0
1775,5405,Really good food steaks are awesome great services it's clean place inside I like how they manage it,1
1776,5406,"Some of the best food I've had all year! Scallops appetizer was amazing and the ahi toast was to die for. I got the peppercorn filet mignon and Chilean Seabass plate, and it was everything and more. Manager made our salad at the table, the owner came over and asked how our food was. Everything was perfect, and our waitress was amazing. The inside is still old school steakhouse like your still in the 50s but in a good way. Will be back!",0
1777,5407,"We had a reservation here for my mother in law's birthday, but they sat us at a table that was near the exit to the outdoor dining.  It was our first time dining out in a crowded restaurant in a long time as a family.  My in laws wouldn't stop complaining about the draft because they are in their 70s and 80s, have medical conditions, and more susceptible to cold.  Where I sat, the servers kept bumping into my chair while they were walking through and I'm a normal sized person.  Honestly there shouldn't even be a table there because it's too cramped.  The hostesses were useless and our server took it up to the manager or owner.  Finally they were able to move us to another table after a long while.  Moving tables and getting our order finally taken took an hour.  After we moved tables I heard the blond hostess making a remark and saying ""Complain complain complain"" while she was walking past our table. Afterwards she was angrily making remarks about another table pretty loudly also.  Her behavior was not professional and ruined the entire experience for us.  Since LA dropped the mask mandate, I only saw one server wearing a mask.  The place was completely packed on a Saturday night and the tables are pretty close together.Our table got the Oysters Rockefeller and crab cake to start.  Both were delicious and very fresh, although the crab cake was pretty small for the price.  Our entrees took quite a while to come out and we were starting to get full from the bread.  They have garlic bread by the way if they don't serve it to you, just ask for it.  Most of our table got the pepper steak filet mignon.  I will say it was very tender, but I think I would've enjoyed a ribeye more.  The vegetable for the day was asparagus and I really enjoyed the baked potato which I chose for my side.  The mashed potatoes didn't look like much but still tasted good.  They did not have gravy so our server gave more steak sauce.  Our server was very nice and he's the only reason why I didn't give them 2 stars.  He brought out a lemon cake dessert for my mother in law for her birthday and made her feel very special.  In all, based on the initial seating fiasco, the rude remarks, and how long it took to get our entrees I don't think I would return.  The food is good for the price paid but I prefer somewhere less hectic and brightly lit because this place had pretty dim lighting.  Valet was $6 for dinner but I heard there was street parking nearby also.",0

1779,5409,Family owned business in Pico Rivera. The restaurant looks old school outside but very intimate inside. I came here for a business meeting with my colleagues & place was pretty busy for a Thursday night. Ordered a bottle of Moscato & obviously the infamous filet mignon pepper steak with a side of rice pilaf. The steak was well seasoned & absolutely delicious. I love how they put green onions & peppercorns on top.They also serve fresh garlic bread on the side & it is to die for! I can tell why a lot of people dine here.Would definitely be back for the Chilean Sea Bass next time!,0

My husband liked his old fashioned too. Our friends had cosmos and they loved their drinks.Dinner was delicious!  We had escargot, calamari and crab stuffed mushrooms. I love that they serve escargot. It's tough to find now. It was good!  I thought the calamari was good but my dad said it was chewy. He's a super tough critic though.My lobster was full of meat and not overly sauced. My mom and sister had the sea bass which I've had before and they loved it. My dad (the critic) gave his steak a thumbs up. That's a lot because he doesn't even like Mastro's!  My husband and nephew had the veal parm and both finished their plates!  The service was excellent and the decor was gorgeous for the holidays. Great experience!!",0
1790,5420,I thought the service was pretty good. However we did order a steak medium well and it arrived medium rare. More rare than medium. The servers were really nice and attentive.

So its a once in a while thing for us,0

1794,5424,Dal Rae never disappoints.  Their service is exceptional and their food is flawless.Our server Steven was exceptional and took good care of us.They give you a little variety of bread and sesame bread sticks for you to enjoy. They also serve some cold veggies. Great appetizers while you enjou your drinks and conversation.I ordered the oysters as an appetizer.  They are light and refreshing.  Served nice and cold.I decided to spoil myself and order their prime rib.  I love my prime rib rare and juicy. It was served just the way I like it. It wasn't over or under cooked. It was a exquisite cut of meat. Their servings are generous and worth the price.My dad ordered the salmon salad. The salmon was also cooked to perfection served on a bed of salad. Generous portion.  The Salmon was nice and moist. So good.The Manager checked on us as well throughout our meal. Their customer service is hands down the best service. You feel like a VIP when you dine at Dal Rae.,0

Nice ambiance and not too loud.I chose the prime rib, but they also have lamb chops and veal.The prime rib melts in your mouth. Cooked to perfection.  Our waitress was on point tonight. Very prompt service and she checked on us regularly.

With its mid century modern setting, old school atmosphere, and staff. Not to mention the food. Table side Caesar, oysters Rockefeller (to die for) topped off with seared ahi, sea bass and lobster tail that literally melted in our mouths. The worst part of the evening was giving up beef for lent. Can't wait to go back for the prime rib and filet mignon. Our meal was ended with crème brûlée all brought to us by Brenden who ensured we were treated to the best experience. I can only add that this place is worth the drive and a shocking surprise in the city of Pico Rivera. Thank you Brenden you made sure this will be our new celebratory restaurant.",0

1799,5429,"We had the prefix menu for Valentine's Day dinner 2 days ago and it was the first and last time we will ever go this place. I had such bad food poisoning from my meal and  literally spent the entire next day in bed because I was so sick. My meal was the sashimi appetizer, Caesar salad, pepper filet and sea bass, baked potato and Creme brûlée for dessert. My husband was okay and he didn't have the sea bass, salad or Creme brûlée so I'm guessing it was one of those. The place was also way overbooked and too crowded to keep it safe. Won't be returning.",0
1800,5430,"To be fair, the bar area and live music were great. I wanted to try this spot out for a date night with my wife. We rarely get a free night and I had made reservations for 8pm a few days before so everything would go smoothly. Got there 40 minutes before our reservation and planned to get a drink at the bar. At 8 I was told it would be a little longer for our table to be ready. After a few drinks in the standing room only bar area, we decided it was time to go. 845 pm the hostess told us our table would be ready in 5 minutes. That's a long time to wait to eat, especially when you have limited time to enjoy a nice dinner.",0
1801,5431,"My heart aches writing this review since we have enjoyed Dal Rae for over 28 years. Unfortunately the service, food and horrible crowding we experienced the last two times makes it impossible not to write critically. The last time (and I do mean last time) we were seated in the servers roadway at a card table that could barely hold our water glasses and bread basket. You could not push your chair back without hitting the person sitting behind you. The server could not bring salads until the appetizer was taken away, same with the entree. All this for $295 for dinner for 4 excluding alcohol. We are sadly disappointed in Dal Rae.",0
1802,5432,"Once seated we discovered we had the table  under a known roof leak. They pushed the table into the table next to us to get us out of the drip. Services was slow which was okay as we were enjoying our time. It was a dining experience. After dessert, and paying $600 for 5 people we were abruptly asked to leave our table. Very rude. Not returning.",0
1803,5433,Great old school spot with amazing steaks. Their bacon/pepper filet mignon was out of this world and rated a top 100. A definite recommendation. While the food was on point I must say service needs a little help. The waiter took forever with everything and forgot one of the drinks which we had to ask someone else because he didn't come back. When he finally came back he started setting up our steak knifes and paused a second as if he forgot to place our order. That's really the only thing keeping this at a 4.,0
1804,5434,"I don't understand why this place is busy or popular.  The only good thing is the waiters are attentive, besides that it goes downhill from there.  You have to pay for valet parking even if you park your own car.  The main course takes over an hour to come out and your food will be cold.  The place is dark so you don't even know what you are eating.  I think they do this on purpose so you can't see your food for defects.  The prices are ridiculously for the amount of food you get.  You are forced to tax on top of the tip if you have a party of 6 or more.  You have no choice, they just serve you the bill.  The restaurant manager is so cheap he wouldn't even give a guest a free drink or discount the meal when their food came out 2 hrs late and there was a piece of gum stuck to the table that ruined this guys pants.",1
1805,5435,"Our family has been going to the Del Rae for many years.  The food is always outstanding. Brandon was our server and Nick was our server in training.

There's valet available for $6. Overall we're a fan and will definitely visit again.",0
1807,5437,"Wow what a great experience! I highly recommend Dal Rae. I'm very impressed and already thinking of when to go back.I made a reservation for yesterday, Sunday for 630pm. I requested a booth and checked in at 620pm. I did overhear someone else say they didn't have a reservation and they were told it would be quite a long wait FYI, so I would recommend a reservation.  As 629pm I received a text that said go to the front, table is ready. My bf and I were escorted to a nice booth. Also the place is huge! They have a bar area, private rooms, and a large dining area. As soon as  we were seated we were brought water and cold veggies, and menus and told our waitress would be right over. They were quite busy so our waitress came by and said she would be right with us. I was surprised Sunday evening how busy it was! Almost every table was full!The waitress was very professional and polite.I ordered the Rodney Strong Merlot and my bf got the dark and stormy cocktail (rum). Our drinks came shortly and they were very good!We decided to get the crab cake as an appetizer. Whew it was big quality and very tasty! I loved it, you could tell the crab was fresh and flavorful, highly recommend.  I did see a lot of tables enjoying escargot FYI.We decided on the large filet mignon with baked potato, and the Chilean sea bass a la Ben with garlic mashed. We got a side of creamed spinach and mac and cheese.Let me start with the sides, the creamed spinach was one of the best I've had, there was lots of spinach amd a lot of flavor. The Mac and cheese was delicious, very homemade-esque lol. The Mac and cheese was delicious, but not the best I've had, I would try something else next time.The garlic mashed potatoes were one of my favorites, while the baked potato was also fresh and flavorful, they prepare it tableside FYI.THE CHILEAN SEA BASS was AMAZING! if you go, you have to order it! I want to go back just for this! It was like cutting into warm butter, with a clean taste. Omg, it has a light layer of parmesan crust and comes with asparagus too. Wow... such a treat.I tried the filet mignon and it was also amazing... although yes the sea bass topped it in my opinion.We did get a couple more drinks and dessert. I got the apple crisp and the chocolate temptation.  The chocolate temptation is the way to go, you won't regret it...so good if you have room left!All staff was great, professional , and polite. They were busy and I saw everyone hustling. Great staff, great management. The manager also came and checked in on our meal.They only have valet and it's $4 during lunch and $6 during dinner.They told us to come back on  Thursday, Fri, or Saturday for live music.",0
1808,5438,"Another disappointment at a very high price.  I came here for my birthday and everything was going well.  Good wine, that wonderful table-side Cesar salad (done by David this time).  Then our dinners arrived.  My prime rib was incredibly tough.  I did not send it back simply because it would've interrupted everyone's meal.  I would have been waiting while they were eating.  I was shocked.  I mean it was TOUGH.  The other's meals were good.  I was so very disappointed.",0
1809,5439,"I was completely in love with this place for its nostalgia, service and good food.  What a disappointment to experience a planned holiday lunch on December 19th.  My friend had the Reuben sandwich.  I never expected it to be brought to us the way it was; looking like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for way too long, appearing and tasting like anything but fresh.  It was embarrassing.  My friend later told me that he ended up throwing out the portion he brought home.  What a shame.  The rest of us had the prime rib sandwich.  For the price, I expected more and better quality.  I was later asked if it was as good as a Philippe's downtown, and I realized that NO it was not.  I likened it to something one might get at Coco's.  The restaurant was extremely busy, but nevertheless, a paying customer who comes here expecting quality deserved better.  I will not be completely negative here as we also had the Caesar Salad.  Fortunately it was delicious as always.  But our sandwiches for such a price, especially that pitiful Reuben, were a very big disappointment.",0
1810,5440,I have eaten at this restaurant plenty of times and is one of my favorite steak houses to eat at. Delicious filet mignon which is my usual order from here :),1
1811,5441,"Poor service, significantly overpriced. Crab legs that were market price = $150 for 2. Food was good, but nothing exceptional. Gratuity of 20% was automatically added ""for my convenience"". Total for 7 people was $1000. Used to be worth the money, now their just taking advantage of the opportunity to overprice everything.",0
1812,5442,"I was thoroughly impressed with the quality of meats and seafood here! The sea bass, prime rib and lamb chops were all cooked exactly as requested. The only recommendation is to perhaps not be so aggressive with the seasoning and the asparagus can be more tender. Overall, the food quality was great and pricing were very reasonable.",0
1813,5443,"My grandparents and I have been coming here for years to catch up, and this place never disappoints. The foods is amazing and the martinis are really really good.If you go, ask to see if you can sit in Flower Dawn's section. She is the nicest person in the world and is an overall great waitress. The food is supreme. The pepper steak is obviously very good (its part of why Dal Rae is so well liked amongst critics), but the Chilean Seabass Alla Ben might be the hidden gem of the menu. Not that well hidden, its the first dish under the seafood section. But its served with a parmesan crust and is so tender and well cooked that you'll wish you ordered a second. For dessert, get the golden brick Sundae. You will not regret it!!",0
1814,5444,"The Dal Rae is mine and my family's all time favorite Steak & Sea Food restaurant. The restaurant opened in 1949. The outside looks old, once you walk into this dimly lit retro restaurant, you'll see a piano bar and dance floor. The service is unique they still have tableside service. Steak Diane,  Cesar salad, chateaubriand, absolutely a fine dining experience. My 3 favorites; Chilean Seabass, rack of lamb and prime rib. Celebrating my mother's 94th birthday she and my brother ordered  favorite fried shrimp, hubby and I ordered prime rib. Their prime rib is the best I've ever tasted, so beefy,tender it's amazing.The Dal Rae is located in Pico Rivera California -  easy drive between Los Angeles and Orange County.",0
1815,5445,"I met a friend here and we were hoping to get a seat at the bar. It was Friday night 7:30 and let me tell you this place was popping! It is very old school and everyone working looks very professional. Marcie I believe at the front desk is a wonderful hostess. She found out it was my first time and managed to get us seated within 5 minutes! I couldn't believe it! It was a small two top in front of the live music area. I had an amazing time! We ordered the tuna tartare which impressed me how I didn't need an additional cracker to eat it because it has a crunchy base!I ordered a 8oz pepper filet medium and it was perfection! Garlic mash and Mac and cheese and their Del Rae signature Cobb Salad! I was really Impressed ,We had a pomegranate margaritaThen we moved to the bar area and had some Justin Cabernet Sauvignon it was delicious we paired that with Tiramisu and their Ice cream cone sundaeI will definitely be back and bring my momma",0
1816,5446,Just to keep it simple the food is mediocre and is overpriced for what it is. We found a hair in our batch of bread and the least thing the restaurant Can do is have the manager come to the table and apologize we didn't even get that . I had to walk myself over to the server and ask for a manager to inform him . Service is not what you expect it to be for falling under the category of 101 best restaurants in LA. Save yourself the money you're better off going somewhere else .,0
1817,5447,"Food is good, and it is nice to support your local restaurant, that is why we decided to go tonight. To our surprise, Dal Rae has racists servers such as SARAH. SARAH YOU work in the city of Pico Rivera, L.A. county, you need to realize that. As a Mexican American  growing community, Dal Rae should not have people to represent them, as Racist.Thank you Mark for your continued support towards the latino, good talk you had with Sarah5 stars for the food. Sorry no stars for Racism.",1
1818,5448,"Food-very goodService-excellentAmbiance-old fashioned fancy restaurant, very comfortable for older generations customers",0
1819,5449,The wait with a reservation was a bit long but the staff was very apologetic.Our server was as accommodating as possible considering how full it was.My food was cooked how I ordered but overly seasoned which I didn't mind because there are worse things. I definitely enjoyed the dim lighting that helped us feel more private despite the full restaurant,0
1820,5450,"So, disclaimer I love a classic steak house. Dal Rae is in the classic 60s Seth tics and ambiance. A real symbol of its community serving classic dishes along with some other choices. Certainly when I decided to have a date with my wife and due to grad prices did not want to drive far there was Dal Rae. The ambiance was like always lively and relaxed. The food well presented and cooked to perfection at least my steak was. My only sad note is they no longer do the Cherries Jubilee or Bananas Foster at the table! What a bummer! How do you expect to wow your audience and fellow customers by ordering a great show stopper as anything flambee? However,  to be fair they still do an authentic Cesar Salad at the table.  If you want to dress up and plan on painting the town red this is still a good romantic sept to begin or end.",0
1821,5451,"What can I say about this restaurant. First time here with family. When you drive up there's valet parking, depending on the time you go you pay $4 for lunch hours, $6 for dinner hours. Once you step inside.. the whole restaurant is dimmed but the section we sat at was a bit brighter. The waiters and waitresses were very attentive, friendly and helpful. Now the food.. wow!! Very delicious!! I order duck, and for dessert I had tiramisu. It is a bit pricey but it's worth it if you plan to go on a date with your significant other. I would recommend this to anyone.",1
1822,5452,"Coming out of Covid, I was looking forward to a great dinner with friends.  When there was an electrical fire in the restaurant in the room we were seating, that should have given me a clue that that was the start of a not a great dinner.I inhaled smoke and my eyes were watery.I expected management to act quicker and then offer sincere apologies and maybe free dessert.  No, we got seated in the outside patio where the mosquitoes were hungrier than us.  Overall, management leaves a lot to be desired and the food was not that good.",0
1823,5453,Great food and service. Dim lit old school steakhouse atmosphere. Everything food option tried was excellent.,1
1824,5454,Always the best! We visit twice a year for either birthday or anniversaries. Best food in town!,0
1825,5455,Were do I start we reserved at least 3 weeks ago requested to be seated inside.NOT OUTSIDE. Well that reservation was worthless . Worst experience ever. Reason and excuse was they were over BOOKED. Not my problem Paid alot of money for the parking lot experience ONLY HAD HOLIDAY menu available WITHOUT any notice. Never again wilI I set a foot here food taste like HOSPITAL FOOD.Dont care for its history of  the place. Its a mess if the help is telling you the problems of what's going on behind the scenes. Try it for yourself . They should get rid of the TENTS and not over book and pay attention to the customers.,1
1826,5456,Excellent restaurant all around. From cleanliness to their service all the way to the dinner plate. Can't go wrong definitely better than steak and stein!,1
1827,5457,I probably think about their Chilean seabass at least once a day. It. Is. That. Good. Their homemade ceaser salad is one of the best. This place is a favorite of ours and our families for decades.,0
1828,5458,Great food.  Great customer service. Amazing steak.  Overall good place to eat dinner.,1
1829,5459,"My family and I have been coming to Dal Rae for many years now and celebrated quite a few special occasions here.  Tonight was the first time back since COVID.  Food is consistent, but it seems they no longer serve the relish tray (veggies on ice), which was a bit disappointing, but I guess not a huge loss.But I'm docking 2 stars tonight for a mistake on an order. I had ordered the Veal Osso Buco, but a Veal Oscar was brought out.  I didn't want the Veal Oscar, in the interest of time, I opted for the Prime Rib.  The server apologized for the mistake.  I had sort of expected to be charged for the cheaper Veal Osso Buco and not the more expensive Prime Rib...but apparently not!  Some finer restaurants may comp the entree entirely...that didn't happen either.  Nor did I get a visit from the manager...While the rest of the dining experience went well, I think they fell short in some areas tonight.",0
1830,5460,"I took my lovely significant other here on a date and during this pandemic they made it safe for people to dine in. I was recommended from a co-worker and this restaurant has been his best recommendation so far! This review is over due, I came here like a month ago and a reservation would be recommended. They have valet parking and they provide exceptional service from beginning to end. The ambiance is still a good date spot considering how they had to adjust with this whole covid situation.We started off with some appetizers. We ordered the baked scallops and the oyster rockefeller. Let me start off by saying these were such amazing dishes especially if you love seafood. Such a simple appetizer yet very distinguished taste with the ingredients they put together. I would order it again and again! Highly recommend those appetizers to start off.For our main dish we both ordered the pepper steak! It is their signature steak dish here and everyone talks about it. If you love pepper, this should be your go to 100. Super juicy and a good portion size. The pepper steak lives up to it's hype.A big kudos to the staff. Very attentive, love the fact that the manager or owner comes around has a small conversation and checking in. That's called manager involvement. Our waiter was super cool, he knew we wanted to have dranks (;  . He brought us out some awesome martini's and lemon drops.  Old school vibe and lovely ambiance for date night.",0
1831,5461,"This restaurant was an unexpected fine.  I used my fellow yelp peeps and found this restaurant.   I took a couple of customers here and they noted it must be good because the parking lot was full.  We did not have reservations, but we were seated quickly.   The prices are a little on the high side, but the quality of food is very good.My buddy has Chilean bass and he said was very good, other guy had salmon which he liked, and I had pepper filet moen.. NOTE.. THEY REALLY PUT A LOT OF PEPPER CORN ON STEAK... ASK FOR LIGHTLY PEPPERED... I like pepper, but this was way over the top...We had creme Brule for dessert with berries... outstanding!  They force valet parking at $6..  so be aware.  All in all, I will take customers back.  Probably an impressive place for a date... but remember,  it us pricey.",0
1832,5462,"This place must be doing something right. I'm hearing 400+ reservations at a time. Reminds me of something out of an old movie.I ate here twice in two weeks and both times everything went well.And I dig the valet, Agapito!!I see This place isn't immune to Yelpers trying to crucify the business and I especially like their ability not give a shit when people complain.We've turned into a society of whiners, complainers.Anyone that can't get their complaint out in 2 paragraphs should be removed.Nobody wants to read these long-winded babblers complain about everything. WILL RETURN SOON!!",1
1833,5463,"Great service, food was delicious. This was my first time and I was celebrating my one year anniversary. My wifey and I had a great time. The only thing that was bothersome was a guest at a table next to us cursing while telling ""stories"". Will definitely go again.",0
1834,5464,"A great old school restaurant that throws you back to the 1960s. They've got classic dishes that are hard to find these days like the lobster thermidor and oysters Rockefeller. Every time I diner here I get the lobster thermidor or pepper steak. I'm sure the other entrees are good, but Dal Rae is known for both of these dishes. The only other place that I know of that serves lobster thermidor is Musso & Frank in Hollywood (another great place). The service is attentive and friendly. It's in Pico Rivera so it might be far for some, but definitely worth the drive.",0
1835,5465,The pepper steak was really good and it literally melts in your mouth but the Buttercake took the prize. It was the beat we have ever had.,1
1836,5466,"We had an excellent time at the restaurant for my friend's birthday. I booked a 12 Noon reservation for a table of 3.It was not a busy Wednesday so we picked a booth at Noon and stayed there will 6 PM. Employee ""Rose"" provided phenomenal service during our super long stay. She had excellent recommendations, was prompt with our requests, was present whenever we needed her and gave us space when we were merrily eating, drinking and having a superb time.Every single employee here speaks customer service. The Valet attendant, hostess, food runners, bartenders, etc. Every interaction with staff was very pleasant!Food was amazing!Rose brought in a birthday treat for my friend and we had a mini celebration for her! How sweet!Prime rib was cooked to my liking. Melt in your mouth!African Lobster Tail was well prepared. Texture was fancy and easy on the palate.Salads were tasty. Fresh fruits (berries) were also a good natural supplement to cleanse the meat and alcohol from our system.Roasted Garlic Brie was very delicious! We should have led off with this to start our afternoon/evening!The best part about all these delicacies we devoured (And devour we did, with ease) was the baked scallops! This particular item was hands down one of the single best foods I had ever eaten! Just to satisfy my craving for their scallops, I will be a repeat patron at this establishment!Drinks:Andrew the bartender prepared unique cocktails for us during our visit.Lemon Drop Martini's were tasty and refreshing.Mandala Extra Anejo based cocktails Rose had Andrew prepare to my liking were also delicious!Overall, it was one of the most memorable restaurants visits I had ever had due to the hospitality, delicious food and lovely drinks. Top marks!!!!",0
1837,5467,"A classic local fav. Surprised to find such a gem in such a small town. The crowd is very diverse, from snob to Joe Shmoe. Which I love. Makes it very inviting since the establishment aims for upscale.I've never had a terrible experience here. Is it Spago? No, but I wouldn't expect that from a small towns most expensive restaurant.I always start with a filthy martini with blue cheese olives. Their martinis are the best because they are ice cold with small ice chips floating on the top, perfection!Next I get the Cesar salad paired with their classic pickle tray (love the nostalgia). Their in-house made dressing is amazing as always. But the finest touch is the chilled plate and forks. *chefs kiss*I've had pretty much all the different dishes here; except the sea bass, which I hear is amazing. Their lobster always hits the spot. You can never go wrong with their ribeye. Their famous peppercorn topping is a unique choice, but is packed full of delicious flavor non the less.  Huge thick asparagus, with any variation of potato, are my personal favorite sides (Classics never die).Speaking of classics, love the live artists they have come in that play the piano and sing! Amazing. The live music plays over the intercom so you can hear it ever so lightly in any room. Last time I went the artist sang slow renditions ranging from David Bowie to The Cranberries. Although, it can get quite lively and gets pretty loud in there as the night goes on; it just goes to show that this sleepy lil steakhouse can get quite a crowd going any night of the week.I'm not a huge fan of dessert so I cant speak to that. But I do know that I leave this establishment satisfied on all accounts every time. Service is great even on their busiest nights; always attentive. I'd say you'd have to go looking for trouble if you have any issues with this fine lil steakhouse in the middle of a Mexican Mayberry. Oh yea, make a reservation. Otherwise show up before 5pm if you want to walk-in.",0
1838,5468,"Service was supppper slow. We waited an hour just for apps.  Food was decent no complaints there. The butter cake is the only worthy dessert. Don't even bother with the other options. We all had The Pork chop, filet, halibut and veal along with clams as appetizer and fried calamari- all dishes were delicious. Hopefully next timeIt won't be a 3+ hr meal.",0
1839,5469,I have a particular fondness for this Restaurant as it was my parent'sGo to for any special occasion.I have never had a bad meal here and I do recommend the famous Pepper steak.What I really appreciate is the atmosphere it has. There aren't too many places you have to dress up for any longer. I still feel like people dress up.,1
1840,5470,I came yesterday after my graduation and it was perfect. I had made a reservation and they sat us down very quickly. Our server was amazing. He was fun and had a great energy to him however I'm the worst and forgot his name lol But service was quick and everything we had was amazing.,0
1841,5471,Charming old school steak house. Celebrated a birthday there and the staff was very attentive. Started with the Caesar salad for two and had a peppered steak which was perfectly cooked and veal that was really tender. Inhaled the dessert so I forgot what we ordered but it was a great way to end the meal,0
1842,5472,"There's a number of reasons this place has been open for over 60 years.It's called consistency. The food is always top quality and amazing.The service is impeccable, from the drinks to the relish and bread tray, not to mention the amazing ambiance, the Dal Rae is as good if not better than any steak house in So. Cal.",0
1843,5473,"We came here on Valentine's Day and had a lovely evening with very yummy food.So when you pull in the valet is there to greet you. They are friendly and dressed sharply and from there you can tell this is going to be a great meal. The valet is $10 cash which is a good price to me.Once you exit your car you check in with the host. We had a reservation so we didn't worry about any wait but I did see some walk ups and heard the wait was over an hour so I highly recommend you make a reservation on open table. It's fats and you don't have to worry about waiting.So for Valentine's Day they had a preset menu with a few appetizers available to order.Let's start with drinks. I ordered an old fashioned and honestly it wasn't the best I have had. I didn't specify the alcohol brand to use so I'm not sure what they used but I've had a lot better.Now for the food we started off with Shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were huge and of course with any steak house they only give you three. I wish it came with more because they were so good.Now onto the three course meal. Me and my wife started off with the tossed Caesar salad and lobster bisque. We both like it but it wasn't anything special but of course what matters the most is the main course.For me I got the Prime Rib Eye Steak. It was cooked perfectly with a perfect amount of juice. It was a huge portion and I wanted to keep eating it even though I was full.My wife got the Prime New York and again it was cooked exactly how she asked it to be cooked and it tasted amazing. We both shared each other's meats and never had a bad bite. Now the portions were huge and since it was Valentine's Day they had a set menu. If we came here on a regular day we would have probably just got one steak as it is more then enough to share.For desert we got the Gold Brick Sundae. It was good, little too sweet for us but it was a great way to end our dinner.The end it was a little pricy since it was $100 per person and we got some drinks but it was a great meal and in the end we had plenty left over for the next day.We would come back again and try a few other cuts of meats. Great staff and amazing food. Solid 4 out of 5.",0
1844,5474,Great place for a nice lunch or dinner. I've been here several times and the food has always been good with excellent service.,1
1845,5475,"What a gem! Great atmosphere, wonderful staff and amazing food. Great for lunch and special occasion dinners. The chopped salad is one of a kind. Pepper Steak is so delicious.",0
1846,5476,Food taste okay. Lack of parking. Valet parking only. Ambience is nice and service and staff are excellent.,1
1847,5477,Really good food from the steak to the fish to the Caesar salad yum! BUT ONE THING their host Marcy is VERY RUDE and has a really bad attitude!!,0
1848,5478,"Great atmosphere, had the king crab legs which were amazing, caesar salad, ahi avocado toast, scallops, oysters, a lobster dish I can't remember but everything was delicious. I can hardly wait to go back!",0
1849,5479,"I know I won't be liked but had a ribeye and wasn't impressed. It had too much fat. My friend had the lobster and the sauce on it was too rich.  The sides of vegetables and baked potato was ok. If you are going to impress a date, drive someplace else",0
1850,5480,"Great food, service and ambiance.Family environment, good price.I hardly recommend this place.",1
1851,5481,We celebrated my wife's milestone birthday at Dal Rae.  It was delicious and I think everyone enjoyed the meal.  My wife got the Lobster Thermador and I had the Pepper Filet.  The service was was very good.  We also had Oysters Rockefeller which was very tasty!,0
1852,5482,"We had a group of 15 friends and family members to celebrate my 60th Birthday and from start to finish it was a wonderful evening and perfect dining experience.  I had the prime rib,  cooked to perfection and the texture and flavor was astronomical. The ambience of the restaurant was excellent and the service was phenomenal.   I'm very grateful for such a memorable dining experience.",0
1853,5483,"Food was good, service was good for the price they charge. Server was barely at our table and never mentioned specialty items. Other servers were on the job and gave great service to their tables. It was like we were a island table which was away from her assigned area.",1
1854,5484,"First time coming, I was brought by some very dear friends of mine. Priced a bit- so don't anticipate cheap, however, well portioned, delish and the staff is very friendly. Dimly lit which I always appreciate, and the prime rib was RIDICULOUSLY amazing.",0
1855,5485,This old school steak house brings back the memories for sure.  We had a great time and the food did not disappoint.  I can't believe it's been 20 years since I've been here.  Definitely coming back again soon,1
1856,5486,"I finally had a chance to try it out, I am definitely a fan, highly recommend the pepper steak and bake potato",0
1857,5487,"Food was average, service good we sat in the back room alone and felt like we were in an empty banquet hall.  So many better options",1
1858,5488,"Great food, great service. Old school.Plenty of parking in their valet lot.Love the Prime Rib. Cooked to perfection and very tasty. I Would rate the prime rib higher than Lawry's, Tractions, Taylor's, Bourbons, Tam Oshanter, etc. However, steak's have to be rated on a different scale. There's too many steak cuts and too steakhouses to be the best. The only reservation that I have these days are the baked potatoes. Us old timers love our large Idaho's which don't seem to provided anymore. Now days that are small and tasteless. The imperfections are buried in butter and cream cheese.",0
1859,5489,The pepper steak was incredible plus the service was outstanding. The atmosphere has a old world charm. The menu has something for everyone. I would have given the place a 5 star review but the steak was not cooked correctly.... But it was still flavorful,1
1860,5490,"Ok service was amazing!Very nice dinner atmosphere for the entire mealThey gave us breadMore bread (cheese bread)A cold dish wish carrots and other veggies, peppers to snack onFood... all the dishes that came out needed a little more salt. I am not a heavy salt eater but even fir me I needed a little bit more seasoningsMy wife got the filet and lobsterI got the famous black pepper New York strip steakThey were ok.... but for 2 people I spent 260, I feel like the main entrees can improve.",0
1861,5491,"I had the fillet medallions, with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Added a side or roasted jalapeños; which where delicious. Coffee and crème brûlée for desert. Food and service where outstanding!",0
1862,5492,Wonderful experience. Great food and service. We will definitely go again even though we live 75 miles away.,1
1863,5493,"Sitting in the patio is not the same as sitting in the dinning room. While I understand you have over 400 reservations and simply can not move us to the next available table for 4 in the dining room (why is that?) then I suggest that you make the atmosphere in the patio a little more tasteful so that when I have to sit out there I can have some of that Dal Rae ambiance that we all know and love. More classic and classy. Was that a waterfall on the back wall? Maybe have that on with some white candles. Sitting in the patio is makes one feel like Tiny Tim staring into a window (or in this case, the dining room ) and seeing what he CAN'T have. Your food is fantastic, I would just like to sit somewhere lovely while I enjoy it.Thats All....",0
1864,5494,On Sunday we had dinner here with a group of friends. 10 to be exact. It was my recommendation that we come here because normally it's wonderful. Our reservation was for 10 people and we checked in at 5pm. They said our table was ready but when we got to it...clearly it was not the right table because it did not accommodate all of us. We had to wait until they fixed it. Not a problem. When we sat down we ordered drinks which seemed to take so long to come..some of us went and ordered at the bar instead. It seemed to take a long time for the server to take our orders as well. Some of us ordered appetizers and about 30 mins after ordering..we got them. 45 mins after that we got our food and someone of did not get everything ordered with the meal and then those items did not appear until the entrée was almost finished. Drinks were ordered that never came and we had to ask a few times where they were. When we were finished and asked for the bill (we all had our own) it took another 30 minutes to get. We checked in at five and checked out at 9:30pm. On top of all that my husband and I realized after we paid that out bill was wrong. We were charged for cocktails that we never even ordered. I am really disappointed because I adore this place and love the food. I know we were a large party but in my book that's way too many issues for one night.,0
1865,5495,Loved Dal Rae! Food was amazing !!The only down side is the seating is very tight. It feels like everyone is on top of eachother,1
1866,5496,"One of first restaurant me and the family have went to and ate indoors, came for early Fathers Day dinner. This place does NOT disappoint! Been here a few times and the food here is awesome! I'm usually a steak person but the Chilean sea bass here is by far the best I've ever had!  My wife's filet pepper steak and she loved it too! Jacki was our server and she was great with the kids.",0
1867,5497,"Delicious delicious and really delicious.  A classy place to eat the finest cuts of meat.  Service is exceptional and the food was delicious,  did I mention that? You must try the pepper steak here as well the garlic mashed potatoes.  Aiways a delight to come and enjoy the ambience and tasty alcoholic drinks.",0
1868,5498,"Dal Rae is one of these old world restaurants that never changes and that's a great thing.  Wednesday night and completely packed!  Make reservations!  Valet parking is only $6 and they were very efficient despite how busy they were.  Now for the food.  We were a party of four.  Two had the Lobster Thermador, delicious (grabbed a taste), one had the Lamb Chops, and I had the Bone-in Ribeye.  Doness on the Ribeye (rare) and Lamb Chops (medium) was perfect!  Portions are extremely generous so be prepared to take at least half your meal to go!  Prices are reasonable considering the quality and portions. In addition, your entrée comes with veggies and a starch.  We all had mashed Potatoes with Asparagus.  Asparagus perfectly done al dente.  Their specialty is the Dal Rae Famous Pepper Steak (Filet or NY).  I had that last visit, it was excellent.  I split it last time but tonight my fellow diners were not doing steak.   Unfortunately we didn't order any appetizers.  I will attest they are amazing.  Last vist we ordered several different ones and split entrées (Lunch Visit).  There is so much on the menu definitely a great place to please anyone in the family.  Service was excellent!  Very attentive and always refilling my water glass.  That's how how rate service!  If this place was closer, I would be there at least once a month!",0
1869,5499,"Best high class restaurant in a 10 mile radius! The food, the service, the wine, the ambience and the people. All who's who of Downey, Pico etc, this is where you will find them!",1
1870,5500,Thank you James for introducing us to this gem. Just the best food. Doesn't look like much on the outside but it sure is something inside. Class all the way.,1
1871,5501,I love this steak house. I've eaten at Del Rae several times and they never disappoint. I had their peppered steak. My goodness. The steak practically melts in your mouth!! For those of you they do not eat any spicy food be warned it can be spicy due to the amount of pepper. The service is always outstanding. The bartender is awesome and the drinks are stiff!! The place reminds me of a fancy 70's steakhouse. Dress to impress. Don't worry about parking they offer valet service.,0
1872,5502,Definitely a five-star experience. I'm a regular here and I'm never disappointed. If you're looking for an elegant evening with delicious food this is the spot.,1
1873,5503,"I went for the first time in June 30, 2022...let me just say that I discover a hidden Gem, EVERYTHING was up to my standards, food was AMAZING, I never had veil before so I decided to try it, Loved it! The waiter was great and very professional. I absolutely recommend this place. I will be coming back for more.",0
1874,5504,"Such an odd place for this restaurant, but a hidden gem.First time here and it was pretty easy to locate, reservations through Open Table was seem less and had the time slots we wanted.Check In process was easy and our female serve (forgot her name, but had red hair) was awesome. She was attentive and always available when we needed her.We were a party of 5 and tried a variety of entrees.Bread was awesome, wish the butter was served room temperature for ease of spreading. They provided picked veggies too, nice touch.Wile friends had cocktails, I had the Macallan (wish the ice were not regular ice, it watered down my drink).We started with Brie (a bit on the salty side), but good. Had crab Cakes, yummy. My dish was crab legs and Chilean Sea Bass.Over all, I was pleasantly surprised and will come back.Love it when I come across a random place that is not a National Chain. This place had history for sure. Felt like old Hollywood.",0
1875,5505,"Lunch today with clients. A pre-birthday gift they bestow upon me, yearly.  Today's visit was really poor.  I hate to say.   We were set up in the back at a incredibly small booth. By the kitchen, coffee bar, order station.   Not usually a big deal,  but there was nobody there.   Our waitress was less than stellar.  Almost to the point of ignoring us.   Our table busman was the only person who really interacted with us.  And, I may add, he was fantastic !!  It would be a huge asset to put him into a waiter position.  I had prime rib, which was delicious.  My client the stroganoff penne dish (she won't order that again). And third in our party had the Filet Mignon Pepper Steak.  I was really reviewing the service because it is usually top notch.  Things just took forever to get out to us.  Not the norm for this Classic Restaurant !!!!",0
1876,5506,"This long time staple in the Pico Rivera area does not disappoint.   Lunch  yesterday with clients.  Busy,  nicely decorated for the Holidays.  We were not rushed at all.  I had prime rib,  which was delicious.  A wonderful culinary experience.  Served by friendly courteous staff.",0
1877,5507,Best steaks and services. The place has a celebrity feel.  A place that you never forget and wish you could go every weekend.,1
1878,5508,You must experience the pepper steak! I did the dine LA menu with the wedge salad and mash potatoes. Service was above and beyond and our server was on it. I got several visits from different managers to see if I was enjoying my dinner and if I needed anything. One last thing they had live music that was a nice touch to a unforgettable evening. Thank you!,0
1879,5509,Fine dining to its maximum !!Excellent Superb serviceGreat foodGreat ambienceAll the best dishes servedHigh quality food.,1
1880,5510,"My wife and I went for lunch today. It was the first time we had dined there since the Covid pandemic.My wife started out with Tangarey gin and tonic and I had an ice cold beer from the bar, that were prepared perfectly. A great way to celebrate being back at the Dal Rea.We started off with the chopped salad, (Crisp Bacon, Peeled Tomato, Avocado, Turkey, Onion, Egg, Grated Bleu Cheese & Marinara Dressing). We asked to split the salad as it is quite large (Entrée size) and big enough to split.They delivered a breadbasket that was plentiful w/ delicious sourdough bread & spicy cracker bread.  It went perfectly with the chopped salad.For my entrée I had the poor man's pepper steak. It is a ground angus beef patty smothered in green onions and bacon, omg so good!It came with their extra creamy mashed potatoes (very similar to Robuchon mashed potatoes) that looked like clouds and they taste amazing light airy and smooth. It also had roasted asparagus on the side, which I gave to my wife, it is her favorite.My wife had the Chicken piccata it looked delicious. It came with the mashed potatoes and my wife's asked for the zucchini sautéed rather than prepared fried Dore style. My wife said it was excellent. From the valet to our server (Dawn) the service was exceptional as was the food , I would definitely recommend it.Thanks Kevin and Lorin for keeping the tradition for all these years at such a high standard",0

It was a little different presentation for chicken piccata as it was prepared with an airline chicken breast (boneless chicken breast with the drumette attached). My wife said it was excellent.From the valet to the server the service was exceptional. I would definitely recommend it.

1883,5513,"Ordered the Christmas Eve special. Two 12 oz Filet Mignon Pepper Steaks with the Caesar salads , spinach, mashed potatoes, and chocolate cake.My pick up time was 4:00 pm. I waited as I understood it was Christmas Eve. I heard the servers when they called on the customers who were waiting, and they took everything out to make sure the order was correct. Nice. Except that didn't happen with me.They called my name, as I was excited, and it was cold and getting late and I said, ""Here! Here! Here!"", three times, loudly. Well, there just so happens to be another Asian lady who was at the table and the server started to give my order to her and was telling her that there were her two steaks! Oh heck no...What in the world? This is not happening.I said to them both, ""Excuse me, that's my name and that is my order."" The older Asian lady looks at me confused. I don't know why, as it is clearly my name and my order. The young server looks at me confused. I don't know why, as it is clearly my name and my order.I know. I know. All Asians look alike. (I'm half, but, .) And that's what I told her. Wish I got the young blondes name.The young server is Beside herself like I did something wrong. She didn't go over my order. As I waited earlier I heard that they ran out of spinach. I heard a customer got corn instead. I didn't get spinach. I didn't get corn. No vegetable for me.  Just a side of MICRO-AGGRESSION was all!Also, no chocolate cake. I heard the man before me got some cheesecake. Of course she didn't even tell me there wasn't any chocolate cake. I got some very hard apple tart. Went straight to the trash.I am so disappointed with Dal Rae tonight. It's the Covid-19, I thought I'd do a solid and do the local fancy takeout. Help out the local business instead of doing the fancy takeout from the Westside... the steak was delicious as always. I guess sometimes you just have to go to the Westside.Of course I will be back, but that sucked.",1
1884,5514,"Fine LA starts mid Oct, great chance to che k out this fabulous high end restaurant, valet parking only, Chilean sea bass is everything!",0
1885,5515,Always our go to place for special occasions.Has such a cool old school vibe like the Rat Pack could have hung out there. Upscale and always delicious food whatever you order. Love the Sea Bass Almandine and the bar makes a great martini or gin and tonic. Service is top notch with wait staff well seasoned with experience.,0
1886,5516,"First time visiting this classic steakhouse. I was blown away at how beautiful the interior is. The perfect place to dress up and celebrate a special occasion. From the wall decor, lighting, and table decor, this place is first class. The food is absolutely delicious.  The short rib was rich and decadent and the ahi tuna was fresh. Be ready to spend some cash though. I will definitely be back however.",0
1887,5517,"Visited this restaurant on Thursday for an office holiday party, 8 of us total.  They had a scaled down menu for the holidays so most of us had to go with a second choice.  I had salmon, which was good but asparagus looked emaciated and the mashed potatoes were dry and cold.  Husband had filet and said it was good but his asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes were also cold.  Three of us had Lobster bisque and all agreed it was bland and lukewarm.  They were busy with multiple parties but waiter was super distracted.  The back room where we sat was decorated nicely for the holidays and the seating was comfortable unlike the front section which is tight and loud. Very disappointed with overall experience and shouldn't have left there hungry! Valet was friendly.",0
1888,5518,"Wow this restaurant is amazing ! I had a 5 o'clock reservation and got there early at 4:30 and sat us right away . Hands down the best restaurant I been for my bday . The service is incredible, always checking if everything is good , if we needed more drinks just Phenomenal. It was mine and my husband first time and it was an experience. It was like the movie Goodfellas type of restaurant which I loved . I got the dal Rae peppercorn steak I believe is called , and I don't like my steak rare or medium so I asked for my steak to be slice in half and cooked very very well which they did and it was delicious, if it was a bit red I didn't mind because the steak was that good and everything we tasted . The best was I got two desserts one for my bday and the lemon cake is a must try . Will  definitely come back soon , the whole menu looks so delicious",0
1889,5519,"I went to this location expecting something comparable to water grill since the pricing was relatively the same and let me tell you that it was a miserable disappointment! Sat at the bar and got drinks to start the night and my old fashion was made incorrectly and my girlfriend's margarita was grapefruit water. Moved over to be seated and they were nice to replace the table cloth since it was dirty. And then we split a salad and ordered the angel hair pasta with a custom request of having it with shrimp. The salad was good, pretty basic but did the job. The pasta was overtly buttered and there was 5 shrimp per pasta dish. To my amazement, each pasta dish went from $20 ea. to $43 because of 5 shrimp LOL what a scam! We could have gotten chilean sea bass for $10 more. Never going to this location again and even the valet didn't give me the correct amount of cash back. Do better!!",0

1891,5521,"Beautiful place, nicely decorated during holiday season. The food is amazing, especially the sea bass, everyone loves it. It's crowded and hard to make reservation during holiday season, but if you can get there, you won't be disappointed.",0
1892,5522,Been here several times and this is an antique steak house. Simply a great place to celebrate in private. Good choices are great and beverages are as well. This place is good for dates or family parties. I'm sure they fit any kind of celebration. Come early as they have an amazing bar area to start happy hour.,0
1893,5523,"Eileen(hope I spelled her name correctly) was super !!!She was so friendly and attentive !The sea bass was to die for !! Cooked oh so perfectly and just melted on the way down.

Can't wait to try something different next time.Thank you !!!",0
1894,5524,"We took my Father in-law here for his birthday with joined family, we were seated at our table with a roof leak from the outside rain.  Instead of seating us at a different table, they moved us right up against another table of guest that was awkward to be so close to them. Every time a  server passed our table, they kept knocking into my chair to squeeze by. The drinks finally came that were good, ordered our meal that took awhile to get and when it finally came, my steak was cold as if it was just sitting there and it was rubbery, my potato was prepared wrong, our cheese cake wasn't the greatest. Right after we had our meal, we were told we had to leave in a minute because they wanted our table (felt like being told to get out). We paid a good amount of money for this experience that wasn't the greatest and will not return. This restaurant was a family favorite but the quality and experience went down hill. We will find another place for future family occasions.",1
1895,5525,"I was there on 1/13/23. Everything was great until the end when paying for our meals. A server named MIGUEL was angered and call me out in-front of other guest saying out loud ""if my service was good, why didn't you give me a bigger tip"" he gotten his 15% but still wasn't satisfy on what he got. It is unacceptable on his behavior to treat guest in that way. I will come back but I choose not to be served by Miguel.",0
1896,5526,"Couldn't make it to Palm Springs so Palm Springs came to me. This restaurant is perfectly old school Hollywood. I think I lived a glamorous past life in the 50's or 60's or something. I just feel it in my soul. I fit right in.On to the foods...my steak was medium rare as requested and the lobster was nicely seasoned. They forgot my cocktail sauce but the shrimp was huge and delicious so I can forgive and forget. Skip the french fries and the oysters Rockefeller. Also their wedge salad was meh. Stick with a steak, lobster, shrimp, baked potato, a cocktail...and you'll be golden Baby.",0
1897,5527,"Only the best. If you work hard. Need to score points with your significant other. Need to close a big business deal. Impress a date. Looking to get lucky with your date, friend, in law. Or step sister. Then this is the go to place.Nothing tops this establishment. One of the best restaurants In So Cal. Probably the west coast. The Wine selection is unbelievable. The bartenders are second to none. Waitress are the best. I've been going to this establishment since the late 80s. I've NEVER, and NEVER heard of anyone having a bad meal or experience here.If you deserve the best. Than go to the best. The Del Rae isn't the standard of a great restaurant. It is the one that sets the ""Standard"" of what a great restaurant and great  restaurant experience is all about.If you don't believe me. Then go and experience what the best feels like. Then you'll agree with me. The best, ""Bar None"". Aiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight",1
1898,5528,My sister in law brought me here this passed weekend and this place takes you back.  Kind of old classic spot.  The food was amazing and our waiter and all the staff were very attentive.  If we lived closer would definitely visit more offer. This place is great for special occasions. Place is very nostalgic kept thinking Frank Sinatra was going to start singing by the bar.,0
1899,5529,This place needs no review just go and you will clearly understand what all the hype is about it's all delicious just bring your wallet but you don't worry you'll get your money's worth. David and Helen of Whittier  treat yourself or better yet let someone treat you here LOL.,1
1900,5530,"Made reservations for Sunday (the day before Valentine's Day) and I was surprised to see that they only had the fixed Valentine's Day menu served that night lol. It was a 3 course meal for $100 per person, which is soo pricey. Anyway, I got the cesar salad, filet mignon with a side of scalloped potatoes, and crème brulee. We also got complimentary bread, which was delicious!The cesar salad was my least favorite part of the meal, they definitely over-dressed it for my tastes; I would ask for dressing on the side. The filet mignon was DELICIOUS! I asked for medium rare and they cooked it perfectly; it was tender and well-seasoned and came with a few asparagus. The scalloped potatoes was one of my favorite dishes, it was very creamy and reminded me of pasta lol. The crème brulee was also super tasty and came with fresh fruits on top. It was so much food I was only able to eat half of my meat and potatoes.Last but not least, the service here was SO friendly! From the valet people to our waitress and even the manager came by to chat with us. They were constantly filling our waters so it was never empty and our waitress was so sweet.Overall, it was a really great meal but I don't think it was worth $100 lol. Note that valet is $6.",0
1901,5531,"Excellent ambiance, service and food. Best prime rib ever. A little pricey but very special.",0
1902,5532,"We had the best Valentine's Day dinner here! Our steaks were perfectly cooked. We couldn't have asked for tastier food and the dessert was delicious as well. The hostess, Frida, was amazing to us and went out of her way to make us feel special and looked after. Our waiter, Dora, was great too and gave us great service. We were super impressed by this restaurant!",0
1903,5533,"I have to say, I have not been disappointed this much by a dining experience in quite some time. I felt as though my birthday dinner was totally and completely ruined by the poor actions of the manager, Mark.The evening started out well enough. Our server was absolutely wonderful and a shining beacon in comparison to the rest of the night. If everyone at this restaurant was like her, I would have recommended this place a million times.We specifically chose this restaurant because of the ambiance of the restaurant. I wanted a dark, old-school restaurant atmosphere. And for a vast majority of the night, this is what was achieved. However, halfway through our dinner, they decided to open the door next to us to accommodate other customers. In the process, it left a glare on me and about 20 other patrons. It was almost impossible to even eat with a glare of the sun in my face, and when I requested help, their best solution was to drape a table cloth over the divider. It felt a bit cheap, especially given the restaurant. We also specifically did not request an outdoor area and requested the main dining area specifically for the ambiance.The manager didn't really help, and I don't think they should leave the door open in a way that inconveniences everyone else for a small party. I was very disappointed at the restaurant and the response of the manager.I felt as though I should have chosen another restaurant, especially given the many options in the area. If this is how they treat their patrons, it is very disappointing and unbecoming of such an establishment. I would NOT recommend this to anyone, and they ruined a special day for me and the rest of my family.",1
1904,5534,"I had lunch here today with a friend for the first time and everything was awesome! Started off with crabcakes and then a Caesar salad. Crabcake was moist and very flavorful! And the Caesar salad was one of the best I've ever had! Generous portion and dressing was delicious! For the main course, I had the Chilean Sea Bass.  OMG! One of the moistest pieces of fish I have ever had! And the Parmesan crust was excellent!  We then finished off with two desserts; the apple tart and the limoncello  flute.  Both were delicious and ended the meal on a great note! To top everything off, we paired the meal with an excellent bottle of Emeritus pinot noir.Finally, our server, Lydia, was the best!  Great personality and her service was impeccable! She told us she has been working there for 20 years and you can tell she loves her job! So nice to see someone so dedicated to what they are doing. Don't let her go! Thank you Lydia!  Will definitely be back!",0

Amazing service, awesome food, very good portion sizes.I recommend making a reservation and asking to sit inside to enjoy the vintage vibes.

1907,5537,"I've lived in the area all of my life but someone managed to never dine here.Finally took the plunge and had some mixed thoughts.Our waiter was perfectly splendid and had great suggestions, such as the scallops for an appetizer (10/10 recommend).Also tried the raw oysters which were just standard oysters.Was pretty disappointed that when I ordered an old fashioned, it came out with ice cubes as opposed to the standard one large solid ice cube (kinda ruins the drink imo).My girl ordered the surf and turf with the peppered steak (their signature dish).  The waiter then explained that the actual portion sizes were smaller than what were on the menu? Okay so then why doesn't the price get smaller to reflect that? Smh.I was not impressed by the pepper steak and don't see what all the hype is about.My entree, however, left nothing to be wanted. I got the veal chop and could not have been happier with my choice. MOUTH WATERING TRUE VEAL.Dessert and coffee came out as expected and rounded out an overall great meal.",0
1908,5538,"Amazing and friendly service provided by all of the staff and they're very detailed about their work as well. The dining area is dimly lit to emphasize the elegant setting which makes the experience so much better.

1910,5540,"This is one of our favorite steak houses out in LA. We come here often... love their pepper steak! The meal as a whole is just delicious, they bring bread, garlic bread a relish dish all complimentary for the table. We have our staple dinner, don't really ever bother looking at the menu. Start with the calamari, followed by the chop salad finished with the pepper steak which we split the NY strip into two. It is a meal which will leave you wanting to come back to the warm feeling steakhouse.",0

First time here, but overall not a good experience.",0

Our food was so delicious , lobster melted in your mouth ,rib eye was perfectly cooked . Drinks were good according to my wife , Four thumbs up",0
1914,5544,"Steak is good but definitely not with $100, specially for the size.This restaurant sells the name and history of it and gets away with charging so much.It's not prestigious anymore, just way over priced.",1
1915,5545,Came here with my husband for his birthday. We had reservations but still wait 10-15 minutes. Parking was easy because there was valet. Inside of restaurant was 50s theme old steakhouse. It was very crowded and not much ventilation. We had complimentary bread and butter which was delicious. The Caesar salad was good but disappointed that they don't make it at the table. We asked why they said due to covid. Not sure how covid impacts to make Caesar salad at the table but the restaurant can be so crowded with poor ventilation. Anyhow the Caesar was good. We ordered the salmon with lemon butter sauce and pepper NY steak. Salmon lemon butter dish was okay. The rice was over cooked and lacked flavor. The salmon was cooked perfectly. Lacked flavor. Cheesecake Factory miso salmon has better flavor. The pepper NY steak was delicious. Cooked perfectly. The topping was delicious. We ended our night with a slice of chocolate cake. Our waitress was very nice but so busy it was hard to get her attention. Probably wouldn't be back for a while.,0
1916,5546,"Good food but bad service.The valet was very friendly, but our server was rude.  Most likely it's just a post pandemic world where every business is struggling with staffing challenges and customer service is out the door.",1
1917,5547,"Not sure why I've never completed this review of one of the greatest dining institutions in Los Angeles. I was recommended to the Dal in the wake of the closing of Monty's in Pasadena and trips to Pico Rivera are always on the agenda during any visit to the West Coast. The rock shrimp appetizer, the table side prepped Caesar salad and the famed pepper steak are the only things I've ever ordered in the 15 years I've been visiting. I'm sure everything else is as good. It's an experience as much as a eating pleasure. There are very few restaurants in America like the Del Rae Caesar Saladanymore.",0
1918,5548,"4.5 StarsStopped in on 11/11 to celebrate my birthday. The three of us had another wonderful experience!SERVICE: Steven was our waiter, and the service was good and not so good. Timing between courses was perfect and Steven was very efficient, but not much interaction with guests. There was an upcharge on the ""split"" Cesar Salad that wasn't explained to us and came as a little bit of a surprise, but okay, I get it. Also, items were pulled off the table too fast without asking if we were done eating.DRINKS: No cocktails this time, but we did order a glass of wine, Moscato ($8.50), for my mother-in-law. Since we were celebrating a birthday, we brought a bottle of wine from home. The corkage fee was $25, but we called in advance and were prepared for this.FOOD: The quality and taste of the food is consistently fantastic. Each meal starts with a complimentary tray of lightly pickled veggies as well as a basket of bread/butter. We ordered the Oysters Rockefeller (6 pcs $24.50) topped with chopped bacon, spinach, Pernod, parmesan, and Hollandaise sauce. This is always one of my favorites! We also got the Dal Rae Cesar for Two ($26). We asked if we could split it to include a third plate for my mother-in-law, and were told, ""absolutely"". What we didn't find out until the bill arrived was that it was an additional $10.75 for the third person. What we had meant was to just take a little of our two person salad and add it to another plate. Oh well, lesson learned. For entrees, we had two of the Famous Dal Rae Eastern Prime Rib (10 oz. is $44/ea.) with asparagus and side. I had the beef steak tomatoes with crumbled bleu cheese, and my wife had the fully loaded baked potato. Both were perfectly prepared and absolutely delicious. My mother-in-law had the Fried Rock Shrimp appetizer ($18.75), which comes with a hot sweet and sour sauce. Finally, Steven brought out a piece of Lemon Cake with a birthday candle. A nice finish.Dal Rae's is a fine dining restaurant with excellent food and wonderful staff. Indoor seating and patio dining are currently available. There's also a full bar area with live music to enjoy. Valet parking was $6 and not validated.I highly recommend...it's a must try!",0
1919,5549,"Our second visit, but only the first time finishing our meal (NOT Dal Rae's fault). We returned after a birthday dinner experience that didn't go well (my issue, not Dal Rae's). Wanted to take advantage of the dineLA menu deal, which was $55/person. The three of us had an amazing experience!SERVICE: Dora assisted us and was absolutely wonderful. She had the right amount of personality and attentiveness, without being bothersome. She perfectly timed out the various courses, so nothing was served on top of the previous course. The entire wait staff did an amazing job. It was super busy, but everything went well. I commented that it looked like ""organized chaos"". We timed several table changes between customers at 90 seconds for a 4-top. Pretty impressive!DRINKS: Old Fashioned ($14), Boulevardier (whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Campari for $17), and Peach Sangria ($14). We also ordered two glasses of wine to pair with our entrees: a Ferrari Carano Chardonnay from Sonoma County, and a Josh Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon North coast reserve ($12.50 ea.). My wife also ordered a Chocolate Martini with dessert ($17). The cocktails seemed a little pricey to me, but that's about the average for the LA area. Quality of the drinks was very good.FOOD: The food was amazing. Each meal starts with a complimentary tray of lightly pickled veggies, as well as a basket of bread/butter. Next, we started on our dineLA menu courses, which we like to share, so we intentionally order different items:· Starters: Hearts of Romaine Cesar Salad and a Bleu Cheese Wedge of Iceberg. Both fresh, well dressed, and large enough to share. We also received a basket of cheesy bread with the salads.· Entrees: Chilean Sea Bass ""ala Ben"" parmesan crusted with a lemon butter sauce, served with asparagus and peppers, and two beefsteak tomato slices topped with bleu cheese crumbles.· Dal Rae Pepper Filet Mignon, their signature steak, with a pan seared onion, bacon, and Peppercorn mixture, served on asparagus, with a baked potato on the side.· Club House Sandwich ($15.95) served with fries. The biggest club sandwich I've ever seen. My mother-in-law will be eating this for a couple days!· Desserts: Crème Brulee, and a slice of New York Cheesecake drizzled with a raspberry sauce.Another fine dining restaurant with excellent food and wonderful staff close to home. Indoor dining and patio dining are available. You can also enjoy their bar, which had live music during our visit. Valet parking was $6 and not validated. Dal Rae's is a must try place. I highly recommend!",0
1920,5550,I've been coming to this place over 10 years and never had a bad meal.  The last two times have been even better.  My daughter had the Chilean Sea Bass and it was moist and delicious and I had the Filet Mignon and it was seasoned very well and cooked just right.  The Chocolate cake is very good too!,0
1921,5551,My husband and I have been going to the Dal Rae since the 1970s and as always they never cease to amaze us with their great customer service and excellent food.,1
1922,5552,"Old school, martini drinking steakhouse.  If you understand the description, then you will get the vibe!",1
1923,5553,Kiki- Enrique was the best! He make the best recommendations recommendations.  Then he saved he saved us a seat in the bar2/Piano bar.,1
1924,5554,"Excellent services, mediocrely cooked medium rare pepper steak and rubber-like prime rib. So disappointed with the food. My waitress was nice and attentive, hence the 2.5 stars",0
1925,5555,Our waitress Elaine is one of the best servers ever.  She made sure we well taken care of and satisfied with our meals .,0

1927,5557,Delicious food and our waiter Bobby was outstanding.  Highly recommend for a great steak.,0
1928,5558,"Seriously disappointed after decades of perfect dining experiences for my family at Dal Rae.  Ten of us dined there recently for a family event.  Two of us ordered two dozen raw oysters which are always a very special treat here.  They were beautifully served but we discovered that whoever shucked them did only half the job.  The oyster meat had not been separated from the bottom shell, making it impossible to slide the oyster directly from the shell to mouth which is a tradition many oyster lovers enjoy.  Never in 60 years of enjoying oysters around the world have I found a place where the oyster was not separated from both the top and the bottom shells.  Dal Rae never served them this way before.  Then I discovered that members of our dining party who ordered Oysters Rockefeller found that some of their shells were empty.There was something seriously wrong in the kitchen.As we were leaving, I mentioned what had happened to a man who said he was the manager. He listened with a faint smile on his face but he offered no apology or ""we'll do better next time"".That response probably will guarantee that there will not be a next time for us at Dal Rae.",0
1929,5559,"I ordered the bone in ribeye, medium rare and let me tell you I finished it all! The best bone in rib-eye I've ever had!!! And the service was amazing. I don't have a photo cause I ate it so fast I forgot to take a photo of it. Highly recommend.",1
1930,5560,"Incredible night!! We had 7 people in our party for Christmas Eve and everyone had a wonderful time. The live music in the bar entertained us while we waited for our table and the decorations in the restaurant were stunning!  We had a fantastic waiter who was on top of everything we needed. The food was spectacular!! The warm bread fresh from the oven, caesar salad, the sea bass was the best I have had, and everyone loved their steak. It was perfection!",0
1931,5561,"You know what? I have teetered back and forth about this restaurant but my last lunch experience was BAD. What's sad is that it's a nice place. Subsequently, it's about FOOD, SERVICE, AMBIENCE, PRESENTATION, and PRICE... at least the way i rate them... so with that said I will explain what occurred recently at Dal Rae... the waitress approached our table but never said her name nor identify herself as our waitress, she just stood over us until i asked if we can order drinks (i thought she worked serving drinks, not the same as the wait staff) ....i the. Asked if we could order an appetizer... we did but she never took our entree order...once we did order entrees the salad was wilted and the Cuban sandwich was completely undercooked with large pieces of pork fat NO MEAT?!?!? I usually have an iron stomach and can eat mostly anything but once i realized what it was i was disgusted...i tried to keep my composure with the waitress being that she's not the cook. So i mentioned it to her... she took the sandwich and brought one ""prepared by the chef""... if the chef is t cooking everything, shouldn't he check everything leaving the kitchen?? After that i just wanted to leave...I don't think I'll ever go back... the reason I'm giving this sham of a restaurant two stars is because the waitress was an elderly woman and my fiancée said for me to be nice...AMBIENCE: 5 out of 5SERVICE: 2 out of 5PRESENTATION: 0 out of 5FOOD: 0 out of 5PRICE: 0 out of 528% WOW...I promise to NEVER write about Dal Rae again because i woo t go there... again...",0
1932,5562,"So... a while back, i returned to the Old Girl... and she returned to her old glory... Maybe it was COVID, maybe a bad day... But Dal Rae is BACK ON THE ROTATION... GREAT SERVICE, GREAT DRINKS and GREAT FOOD...it's that simple, Dal Rae is back... BUT in their defense, maybe they never left....GREAT JOB ALL",0
1933,5563,"What can anyone say about Dal Rae...class act that's hard to follow in the local area right? Well....my fiancée and I went there recently and found that it was lacking a certain...""Je ne sais quoi""...the restaurant itself was charming as always, and the service was on par BUT the food was on par as well.... And for the price we paid, i just felt like i expected a little more flavor for my money....not more food just a better seasoning or quality of taste... not sure how to describe it but maybe the old gal has lost a step...",0
1934,5564,Pricey but good food. My family and I have been coming here for years for special occasions. The ambiance and atmosphere is very high class retro. I love that they bring vegetable and bread platters for the table and the cheesy bread is fantastic. I love the bananas flambeau for dessert. Great place to come for a high end meal,1
1935,5565,"My wife and I were home and decided to too go have 1 drink. We Showed up about 8pm, we sat at the bar like normal and had an amazing time with the GM Mark Cilloniz.He is the best, professional, respectful and show a true concern for all of the restuarants clients.Thank you my brother for on of the best  Memorable evenings On our 8th year anniversary",1
1936,5566,The food was amazing!! Our server Brandon did a fantastic job in taking care of my wife and I for our 11th wedding anniversary. He maintained our table clean and gave us great recommendations regarding food. The restaurant itself was nice and elegant. I will definitely be coming back with more family to share in all the goodness.,0
1937,5567,I was not near impressed with the food. I've had better seasoning quality steak and lobster at other local restaurants. I personally feel that this restaurant is over hype and I would rather dine at The Palm in Downtown LA if I'm in for a good steak dinner and lobster.. oh and don't forget the Cheesecake too,1
1938,5568,"Amazing. Everything you want in a classy place: great ambiance (relaxed), strong martinis :), wonderful food and the service is really something, the attention and care for each patron is top level.",0
1939,5569,The servers here are amazing and they took really good care for my mom and I.Peaceful relaxing restaurant and the food is excellent!,1
1940,5570,This place was amazing. I've been told to go to Dal Rae's for years. Finally made it and it is now my favorite place for a ribeye. The service was top notch as well. I will definitely be going back soon.,0
1941,5571,Ignore the bad reviews. This is a six-star restaurant at four Star pricing. I've been coming for 48 years.,1
1942,5572,Great food great service it is on the pricey side but the food is delicious is worth it. Nice place to celebrate a special occasion,1
1943,5573,"A top pick on my All-Time Favorites List, this place is the epitome of old school Class, Quality & Service.  Dining here is a 1st class experience that begins with your valet parking. You are welcomed like you're someone special, then seated in the dark dining room with leather booths.  The steaks & seafood are all of the highest quality; the cocktails are top shelf; the Caesar Salad is created table side; the pepper steak is amazing; ... they have abalone!  (I love that stuff & rarely find it).  I live about an hour away from Dal Rae ... it's worth the drive. It's a special place.",0
1944,5574,"The service, the ambiance, and of course the food were all excellent. The smell of the place, smells of the past. The lighting was perfect since my wife and I was celebrating our anniversary. The complimentary cake was on point. The coffee was smooth. The waitress said it was Apfells. Elisa was our waitress and her smile made it a nice experience. The helpers all poured coffee with a smile. Will go back again very soon.",0
1945,5575,"The entire experience was just PERFECT, hospitality, great taste, staff absolutely professional and ALWAYS available. We sat at the restaurant area but next time I want to try the bar section, they had really good live music , like REALLY GOOD. We cannot wait to go back.",1
1946,5576,"I was just bragging last week about how we have celebrated 21 years of our wedding anniversary at the Dal Rae restaurant and how much we've enjoyed it every time. Sadly, I have to say that Thursday was very, extremely, disappointing. Started with the valet parking. We pull in and for 10 minutes there's nobody there. For 7 o'clock on a Thursday it was crowded, jampacked in fact. It appeared that there were only two valets working.When we were seated, in a booth, there were already two people seated in our four person booth and there was a divider board shoved in between us. Not very romantic as they could hear everything we said. We then waited, and waited, and waited for someone to acknowledge us. After a further 10 minute wait our waitress popped over and said I'll be with you in a minute and proceeded to disappear for another 10 minutes. From the time we pulled in we are there 25 to 30 minutes more or less being ignored. Our waitress, who was very sweet and friendly, took our drink orders and got them promptly to our table. We ordered right away since we knew it was going to take longer than usual to get our dinners. Normally they serve a gorgeous little ice filled tray with crudité but, at this point we have our drinks, no water no bread no crudité. We asked our server about it and she said that they don't give it to us, now you have to order it and pay for it. OK, well, that sucks. That little amenity kind of set them apart from most restaurants. But now, no more.I order the same thing every time, sea bass ala ben but the delicious crusty top was missing. So disappointing. The baked potatoes have shrunk to  a third of the size and was more sour cream than potato.When we made the reservation we made sure to let them know it was our anniversary. At the end of the meal, no slice of coconut cake. If you bother to ask if this is a special occasion and then ignore it, that is a mistake. Anyway, we were just going to order and split a piece of coconut cake but, alas, it's not on the menu. The coconut cake is just for birthdays, anniversaries and other special occasions. Gratis from Dal Rae. We just skipped dessert. Sadly.One final note. The ambience at del Rae is special. The lights are down low, it's usually fairly quiet and romantic. I know they added the patio a few years ago which is right behind the hostess stand and that's always very bright and light out there if that's what you choose. We choose the candlelight and the cozy booths. Unfortunately, they seem to have added another seating area outback and the door kept opening with waiters and patrons and it was a flash of sunlight in your eyes every time. At one point somebody just left the door open. Pretty much ruined the ambience.On the way home, we decided that our 22nd anniversary would be celebrated somewhere else. We're thinking about trying the Cellar in Fullerton.  I love that we've had this long-standing tradition of the Dal Rae on our anniversary but if we're going to spend more than $200 on dinner I want to come away happy and satisfied.",0
1947,5577,The ambiance is very romantic. The portions are great. The drinks were hearty. Super pricey but well worth it.,1
1948,5578,Took my wife here for our 25th wedding anniversary a Couple of years ago and we've been going back ever since. My wife always orders the Chilean Sea Bass which she rates as 5 star. I always order the Prime Rib which I would rate 5 star. Do your selves a favor and order the table side Caesar Salad it was wonderful. Service is excellent. The food is excellent but the decor is a little out dated.,0
1949,5579,"Service started slow because they were busy but once we got started it was great. Sometimes it's refreshing to get some old school classics, this place reminds me of the celebratory meals we had growing up. Management at this place gets that this place is a gem and was so hospitable. You're not going to get fussy food here, just the classics. The pepper steak is a must.",0
1950,5580,Went here last night with a party of 10. Like always this place is fabulous. If you like steak this is a must. The 16oz New York strip Peppercorn steak was amazing. I ate every bite. Drinks were great as well as the waiter and atmosphere. There is a gentlemen playing the piano where you can sit around and order drinks while listening to the music. This is a legit steakhouse ( sea bass was amazing as well) bring your wallet it is not cheap but worth every penny.,0
1951,5581,"I am surprised as to how good this restaurant is! Came here to celebrate a birthday on a Thursday night. Our reservation was for 7:30 pm and when we arrived, it was packed! There is only valet service available which is only $6.00  As you enter, you see the bar on the left and straight ahead is a piano bar. Where you can sit and eat on the piano as the artist is playing music. Reminds me of the stinking rose which is now shut down. Anyways, the music was great and make for a good sing-along. We got seated right away and we ordered water & drinks. I will say service was painfully slow, but we were in good company so it didn't bother us too much. Drinks came out and we ordered Escargo, fried zucchini, and stuffed mushroom for appetizers. Escargo was to die for! it was my first time trying it and I would order this again in a heartbeat! Zucchini was so crispy and bursting with flavor! Overall, our time there was eventful, the food was top of the line and the servers were friendly, funny, lighthearted, and welcoming. You'd never think there's a hidden gem in Pico Rivera but damn... everybody needs to try this before they die lol",0
1952,5582,"First time here for my brother's fiancée's birthday.  We were quickly seated -- my brother had reservations. We were seated outside but the outdoor heater kept us cozy throughout the night. The complimentary bread was nice -- try the cheese bread! I had a Midori Sour -- super yummy. Crab cakes were delicious, a must try! Ordered a medium prime rib (not pictured .. didn't look that appetizing) & it was decent. Wasn't like lawrys but that would be unfair in comparing the two restaurants. Sides were good though, can't complain. They gave my future sister in law a birthday dessert which I thought was nice gesture. It was a sweet pineapple type of cake. I would go back.",0
1953,5583,Food was amazing lounge area was so awesome servers were right on top of everything very old school the steak was perfect.,1
1954,5584,Too dark for my taste. Parking is no the greatest but food and costumer service are great.,1
1955,5585,Went last night with my husband and daughter.  Our favorite restaurant!  Has the most delicious food from appetizers to entrees to dessert    Their appetizers are so yummy.  Had the baked oysters and the Brie cheese with garlic and buttered toasts   To die for. Had their steaks which are cooked to perfection and their melt on your mouth sea bass.  I wished I lived closer.  I would go more often!!  It's an hour drive but worth the time for sure.  The service is impeccable. Always a very pleasurable experience!!,1
1956,5586,"We had a lovely anniversary dinner here recently. The food was amazing as was most of the service, which with the staffing challenges of 2021 is quite an impressive feat.While our waiter was perfectly fine, I wanted to spotlight an employee by the name of Dorian who was so friendly and as the restaurant was packed, went above and beyond in his own job while also assisting fellow staff with any tasks they couldn't get to. I specifically asked for his name as he definitely embodied the Dal Rae spirit and is an employee worth investing in.Looking forward to going back to try even more items on the menu!",1
1957,5587,"As a chef I want to give them benefit of the doubt. I have a party of 12 and I understand the difficulty. I'm a little bias because is serve thousands of people a day at multiple locations: flavors were good. I drove past this place for 7 years and have always been drawn to the stories of high end food and and old school flair. Brie app was awesome, serve a little slow for a Wednesday but it is holiday season. Food... everything was cold. Look like certain items sat under a lamp or pass too long. I had the duck. For a high end location I expect it medium not well done. Rice on side was ice cold: my wife's pork chop was cooked beautifully but looked like it sat too long  because same issue, cold. My daughter pastas sauce was cold, butter sauce broke while waiting. Can't speak for everyone's else's meal because I didn't want to ruin a good time. Overall I will try again because maybe if it's a smaller party hit will be different: 3 for now but hopefully a five when I go back.",1
1958,5588,"Outstanding restaurant.   Customers for many decades and have never had a bad experience.   Seafood, steaks, and veal are all done to perfection.   The service is top notch.   Prices have increased significantly in the past year, but that is not unusual.   Highly recommended.",0
1959,5589,"Classic old school restaurant that has been a favorite for decades.    Wonderful service and I have never had a bad meal.   The place is always packed but the service is always courteous.   Excellent cocktails.   You can't go wrong with any of the steak or seafood items on the menu.   The only thing preventing the Dal Rae from a 5-star rating is that they seem to have added more tables in the last 2 years.   It is more noisy and crowded and it is not always possible to have a quiet meal.   Still, you will love the place.  Highly recommended.",0
1960,5590,"The food, atmosphere, and service was excellent. We have dined here many times over the last 10 years and have never been disappointed. I especially love the table side Cesar Salad. The staff are experienced and professional. Dal Rae is our favorite place to take our out of town guests.",0
1961,5591,The Dal Rae is an institution since the 1950s.  Consistently an outstanding restaurant.  I have been eating here for about 50 years with family and friends.  I have experienced some of the finest high end restaurants around the country and the Dal Rae holds its own year after year.  The sons took over from their Father and I am sure he would very proud of how they have maintained this great restaurant.  The Dal Rae has become the place where my wife and I take special friends and celebrate important memories.,1
1962,5592,"It had been a while since we were able to enjoy a dine in experience in LA County.  This past Sunday we changed that situation.Our table enjoyed lobster, steak and prime rib.The food was quality!  Be prepared to enjoy these large portions in future meals.  We do love our left-overs.The service was top-notch!  Questions were asked of us, making sure both our current and expected needs be met.A nice visit at a nice location.  Quality!",0
1963,5593,Excellent business lunch at this long time classic.  The food and service were both top notch.  All four of us diners enjoyed.,0
1964,5594,"Happy Halloween, Yelpers! Bwahahah & muwahahah!!!! Then again, Happy Post-Hallloween, I should say since I'm updating this review the next day, hehe!Parking: $6 Valet.Since we're no longer kids (but just kids at heart), our traditional, adult Halloween dinner (started in 2018) was called to order & it was hauntingly awesome! Super thanks to ""13 Husbands Dead-Black Widow / Hostess w/the Mostess"", Yelper Isobel L., who also ""trick-or-treated"" us to some yummy desserts if we came dressed up & heck yea, we all did, bwahaha!Joined by Yelpers ""Superwoman"" Vienna T., ""Master Yoshi of Dragonball Z"" Ran C., ""Cowboy"" Gary I., ""Rocker / Blonde Howard Stern"" Jim W. & yours truly, eternal 90s ""P.L.U.R. - Kandi Kid Raver,"" we were definitely an eclectic bunch! Even the waitresses donned cute kitty or unicorn ears headbands. Some patrons were in costumes too!Happy Hour (HH): Mondays thru Fridays from 3pm to 6pm. Isobel & I got there earlier & snacked on the following:Drinks: $4.25 Shirley Temple for me & Isobel had a glass of red wine.Food ($8 each): Mushrooms (2pcs) stuffed w/Lump Crab Hollandaise, delicious! The mushrooms were plump & hearty, while the crab meat to hollandaise sauce ratio was perfect & flavorful. We also enjoyed the Ahi Sashimi on Toast, which was tasty & refreshing. I would get both of these again.Dinner TimeComplimentary Items: Relish Tray & Bread Basket, yummy apps to warm up the palates & tummies.Drinks: Iced & chilled water for everyone. Ran & I each had $4.25 Unsweetened Iced Tea, Jim had a Johnny Walker on the Rocks, while Isobel, Vienna & Gary had their red wines.Entrees: Each meal comes w/side of cheese bread too! So good!!!$13.25 Wilted Spinach Salad that I split w/Isobel. Prepared & served tableside by our waitress, Eileen. The portions are large & great for sharing between two people. Spinach leaves, bacon bits, balsamic vinegar & a squeeze of lemon, simple yet classic! Mixed together & cooked over a portable stovetop, yum! Definitely recommend getting this!For my entrée, I got the $46.00 (10oz) Chilean Sea Bass. I loved it so much during DineLA that I got it again. Served ""ala Ben,"" amazingly satisfying! A parmesan crust topped w/caramelized onions, served in lemon butter sauce. This sea bass was hearty, tender & flaky, served w/grilled asparagus & a slice of red bell pepper. For a side accompaniment, I went w/a baked potato, generously topped w/sour cream & chives, which I later take took home. Also prepared & served tableside by Eileen. I also sampled some of Vienna's Mac & Cheese side dish, cheesy goodness!The others got the following: Ran's $9 Lobster Bisque + $49.50 Prime Rib; Isobel's $36.00 Wagu Flatiron Steak; Vienna's $39.50 Petite Filet Pepper Steak + $8.50 Mac & Cheese Side Dish, Gary & Jim's $84.00 Steak Diane (shared between two people). You can see their pics & read their reviews later on.Desserts: Woohoo, the moment is finally here! Gary, Jim & I each had soufflés ($13.25 each) - Gary & I had the Gr& Marnier, while Jim went w/ the dark chocolate. Each soufflé was served w/ fluffy whipped cream w/their respective Gr& Marnier or Dark Chocolate sauces. The soufflés were sinfully delightful, so warm & creamy! As for Ran & Isobel, they split the Bananas Flambé ($22.50 for 2 people), which was not only fun watching, taking pictures & recording Kent (Manager) cooking it (while serenading us w/ ""Kumbaya"", lol!), but it tasted amazing too! Vienna had a taste of various desserts since she couldn't decide what to get.Service: Our waitress was Eileen again. Loved her! She was sweet, funny & attentive. Excellent service all the way! The male servers, who also attended to us earlier were sweet & attentive too!Overall, we had a great Halloween dinner (thanks again, Isobel!) & looking forward to coming back here next Halloween, yay!",1
1965,5595,"Happy Halloween, Yelpers! Bwahahah and muwahahah!!!! Then again, Happy Post-Hallloween, I should say since I'm updating this review the following day, hehe!Parking: Valet went up $1. Previously, it was $3.50 when I was here the first time for 2018 Winter DineLA.Since we're no longer kids (but just kids at heart), an adult Halloween dinner was called to order and it was ghoulishly fantastic! Also, super thanks to our Foxy Hostess with the Mostess, Yelper Isobel L., who not only dressed up as a groovy 60s chick, but she also trick-or-treated us to some yummy desserts if we came dressed up, and yea, we all did, bwahaha!Also, joined by Yelpers Ran C., Gary I., and Jim W., we were definitely an eclectic bunch! Ran donned his Clown Killer Mask, Gary was a BDSM Pleather Guy, Jim was a Wicked Devil, and yours truly represented the finest Wizarding House from Hogwarts: Gryffindor!!! Even the waitresses donned cute bunny, kitty or unicorn ears headbands. Even some patrons were in costumes too! Okay, back to the food and drinks...After browsing through the menus, here's what we got:Complimentary Items: Relish Tray and Bread Basket, yummy apps to warm up the palates and tummies.Drinks: Chilled water for everyone. I had a Shirley Temple, Ran had whiskey, Jim had a Johnny Walker on the Rocks, while both Isobel and Gary had red wines.I got the $22.75 Free Range Chicken Breast with Wild Mushrooms. Served with asparagus, garlic bread, and a baked potato loaded up with butter, sour cream and chives, fabulous! My chicken breast was juicy and hearty. I would have considered beef, but I was trying to be healthy, and of course, ensuring that I have room for dessert since beef tends to be very filling, hehe!The others got the following: Ran's $54 Lamb Chops, Isobel's $37.50 Petite Filet Pepper Steak, Gary's $53.75 Rib-Eye Steak, and Jim's $38.75 Salmon.

As for Ran, Isobel and Jim, they all had Bananas Fambe ($22.50 for 2 people and $12.75 for 1), which was not only fantastic watching the Manager cooked it, but it tasted amazing too!Service: Eileen was sweet, funny and attentive. She took great care of from getting our food and drinks out quickly, to preparing my baked potatoes and soufflé toppings, yay!Ambience and Décor: There were three other tables dining with us, and afterwards, we had the place to ourselves, which was really nice and intimate. We had a great time and didn't feel rushed.Overall, we had a great Halloween (thanks again, Isobel!) and looking forward to coming back another time, woohoo!!!",1
1966,5596,"2018 DineLA #3 - January Winter Edition, Dinner Menu $49.00Third time's a charm! Dal Rae definitely didn't disappoint!Parking: Valet Parking $4.50. The valets here are friendly & professional.Joined by Yelp Bestie, Isobel L., on a packed, 8pm Sunday night dinner. I got here a little earlier & my awesome bartender made me a delicious, virgin Pina Colada $8.27. Garnished w/an orange wedge, topped w/a cherry & two straws, it smelled super aromatic (coconuts & pineapples) & tasted amazing! My bartender even offered to carry over my drink to our table. What service!We were thrilled to get a booth seating - spacious & comfortable. The restaurant itself is dark, yet romantic. Old school feel (Think of Taylor's Steakhouse on 8th Street, in Koreatown). Afterwards, our server, Jacki came over & took care of us for the rest of the night. Both her and the male servers were all sweet and professional. Service was excellent & on point.DRINKS:  Other than my Pina Colada, iced water for both of us - continuously refilled throughout the night.COMPLIMENTARY ITEMS: Assorted Bread Basket: I wasn't a fan of it. The sourdough was tough around the edges, but soft & tender inside. The long bread cracker was just too hard. Didn't touch the soup crackers since our starters started arriving. At least, the butter was smooth, creamy & spreads easily onto the breads.  Chilled Veggie Dish - Assortment of veggies - celeries, radishes, carrots, salted cucumbers, green/red jalapenos. I liked this veggie dish. It was refreshing & crunchy, better than the bread basket.STARTERS: I went w/ the Soup du Jour (New England Clam Chowder or French Onion Soup). I went w/the latter & omg, I was in heaven! Generous amount of cheesy goodness covering the entire bowl. Plentiful chunks of bread & caramelized onions inside too! It was rich, hearty & decadent without the beef broth tasting overly salty or bland. It was just right! As for Isobel, her starter was the Bleu Cheese Wedge of Iceberg.ENTREES: Each meal comes with side of cheese bread too! So good!!! Steakhouses = Beef, right? Nope, I got the Chilean Sea Bass served ""ala Ben,"" amazingly satisfying! A parmesan crust topped w/caramelized onions, served in lemon butter sauce. This Sea Bass was moist, tender & flaky, and served w/grilled asparagus. For a side accompaniment, I went with a baked potato, served tableside by Jacki. Generously topped w/sour cream, cheese sauce, bacon & chives. Delicious! Originally, I had my heart set on the Filet Mignon or Flatiron Steak. However, both meats' sauces were spicy, and so I declined. Ultimately, the Sea Bass was amazing! Isobel got the Filet Mignon, and it was a huge piece! Also served w/ grilled asparagus & a side of baked potato too. We both ended up taking leftovers home.DESSERTS: I got the Gold Brick Sundae. Consisting of chocolate covered, vanilla ice cream served in a lace cookie shell w/nuts on the bottom. Loved everything about this dessert sans the lace cookie shell. Darn thing was too hard to break, and so I left it. Isobel got the NY Cheesecake topped w/raspberry sauce. Also, included in this DineLA menu is tea or coffee w/dessert. We both got tea. Served each w/our very own silver teapot & wedge of lemon. I got the Earl Tea, while Isobel got an Herbal tea.Overall, I was very impressed w/Dal Rae's DineLA Dinner Menu. For $49, you get so much food along w/ outstanding service. It totally made my DineLA #3 adventure an amazing one! Thank you again, Dal Rae Restaurant, yay!",0
1967,5597,"Hands down the best place for prime rib! Their service is amazing and even though it was pretty crowded for the holidays, our server was super sweet and helped us order since it was our first time here.We ordered the Pepper Steak, Prime Rib, Lobster Thermidor, Lamb, and Bone in Rib eye. And for dessert we ordered crème brûlée and our server bought us cakes since we were also celebrating birthdays!Such a great experience here and can't wait to come back!!",0
1968,5598,Great food and service. The Cesar salad is so yummy and the portion is enough to share.,1
1969,5599,My friends and I always celebrate birthdays here. I usually order the sea bass or pepper steak. Since it was my birthday dinner I switched it up and ordered the tomahawk med rare. It was very good. The service is always exceptional (Chuy is one of our favorites). I look forward to when the bar area reopens with the live music.,0
1970,5600,Great place to grab a good steak. Has an old school feel from the 50's. Although the actual establishment might benefit from a revamp the staff and food are great and worth checking out.,1

Wr ordered the jumbo shrimp pasta, calamari, clam chowder and 20oz rib eye. Everything was delicious.  The atmosphere was very old skool. Had a live singer playing the piano. It was a good experience. Will definitely come back again.   You can call or make reservations on open table app/wedsite.",0
1972,5602,Amazing food and great atmosphere. It's like taking a step back in time when service and quality were of the highest priority.,1
1973,5603,Beautiful restaurant excellent food wonderful service highly recommend. It's forced valet so be prepared to pay for that service.,0
1974,5604,This place has sure gone downhill. Overpriced mediocre food. I have been coming to the Dal Rae for over 25 years and was not impressed one bit during my last visit. To start off they discontinued the relish tray (cheap owners) Our steaks were overcooked. Overall food quality sucked and the service was terrible at best. Not to mention a total ripoff!P.S. Get your SH** together Loren and Kevin!,0
1975,5605,Anniversary dinner. Great place and wonderful food. Started with the tuna on toast( always amazing) then the rib eye. Great service and friendly atmosphere.,1
1976,5606,Unbelieveable Meal!  It was perfect from beginning to end...I had the Chilean Sea Bass Ala Ben..It was phenomenal!  My hubby had the Veal chops with Mushroom Sauce...It was tender and incredible!  My Friend P had the Dine LA special which was 3 courses for $55...Everything was awesome!  So rarely do we go out and experience such perfection! WTG Dal Rae!  Brava! Btw...Don't get me started on the garlic toast...It gave me life!,0
1977,5607,"This has been my favorite restaurant for 40 years, but last night it let me down for the first time. We brought a first-timer and had told him the history of the restaurant and how everything on the menu was delicious.Number 1, they sat us at a table that had not been set up, 2. the relish dish had no pickles, which are my favorite. The appetizer, shrimp scampi was tough and tasteless. 3. The caesar salad was ok but is not made tableside anymore.  4. I ordered veal Oscar and it hadn't been cooked enough. when I asked the waiter about it he said he didn't know it was supposed to be rare. It shouldn't be and he should know that. 5. The manager, Gabriel brought me another one and struck up a conversation and he basically saved the evening. No comps though. The waiter had no personality until we were leaving.It has always been a delight to eat there, but it was so disappointing. The prices are extremely high. When you spend close to $400 dollars for 3 people, everything should be excellent.",0
1978,5608,Dal Rae's never fails to disappoint. I had the peppercorn filet mignon with a fried calamari appetizer and my wife had the sea bass with crab stuffed mushrooms for her appetizer. Everything was very tasty. The sea bass was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious and the filet mignon was one of the best I've ever had. Our server was attentive and on point. We can't wait to go back!,0
1979,5609,"The service is very good. I will say that, even though a girl wearing a mid-drift shirt very sternly asked us to put on a mask, when several others did not have one on. The place is worn down and could use some facelift work if you want to put yourself out as a fine dining establishment -- which I can give up if the food is good. The wall looked as if it had mold up at the top where we were sitting; probably from rain damage. Yuck!The drinks are not good; they taste like cheap booze is used.I also fail to see what the big deal about the peppered steak is all about. I ordered the filet mignon medium, and it was so rare it was saying ""moo."" The scalloped potatoes are very good and I appreciate that the baked potato my husband order was not a reheated one, as so many restaurants tend to serve.In a nutshell: (From the prix fixe menu)Calamari - good.Pre:Wedge salad: the lettuce was old and not fresh at all.Clam chowder: Not good at all, grey, flavorless and every spoonful had shells; not a very comforting soup at all.     Even though it had shells, it lacked any type of clam stock at all. Very pasty roux.Entree:Prime rib was good - very generous cut. (no au jus; if they have it, it was not offered).Peppered Filet: Again, flavorless. (Super big portion.  I took it home to try to fix it).Creme brulee: Bland.Tiramisu: I'll pass.  I don't get it; so many rave reviews on here.  Go somewhere else if you are willing to spend $300 for two.  I don't mind as long as the food is good.Again, the service is wonderful, but the food and drinks are not.",1
1980,5610,"This was my first time, I'm amazed by the service I received from Gabriela she was very attentive to our needs. I definitely recommend this place. Food was great. I'll be back soon!",1
1981,5611,Doesn't get much better than Dal Rae. Old world dining with the highest quality and service.,1
1982,5612,"Few things to consider, ""food, service, ambiance""?  Yes,  all the above were great.  It's awesome to know we still have places like this that have been around for awhile and still running solid!  From the service, the hospitality, and the always attentiveness to the customers, the different options on the menu and the quality which pretty much you can't go wrong oh and the ambiance with everyone is lively and happy to be there from the consumers to the people that work there.  A couple notes, it is Valet parking and also you don't have to come in a tux but it is nice if you make an effort on how your dress...does enhance the experience.  We ordered calamari and that was good and we also ordered some shrimp that came in some type of sauce and that was really good...but the one that took the cake for appetizers was the escargot, wow!  I've had them at other places where the taste is a little Bla or you're left with a after taste but the ones here were great!  I ordered a Ny steak and with a pepper sauce, the steak was good but the sauce was awesome.  My wife ordered the Salomon and she raved about it all night, the taste and how well it was cooked.  Another thing to note is that they did take a bit to bring out the food but it gave us time to mingle and order drinks which we really didn't mind and it could of been that way because it was a full house that night .  Also looked like they did some renovations, we sat what looked like was one of the additions which we didn't mind but if you would like to get the whole feel of the place the I recommend you ask to be seated in the original part of the restaurant.  This place has been around for some time, I met some people that night that had been coming here for a very long time, so long that they remembered when there wasn't anything in the area not even freeways and they had to take nothing but streets coming from Pasadena.  It's pretty cool that we continue to cherish the little gems we have in our City of Angeles, hope you enjoy!",0
1983,5613,"I don't know how this place gets away with charging these prices.  The facility is 60 years outdated, and the food is like a random Tuesday dinner.  When I think of a fancy steakhouse (like this is trying to be) and see these prices, I think of Mastros.  This place is no Mastros.  It would be more equivalent to  ""Mastros' old uncle at the cookout still trying to be cool in a polyester warm-up suit and church shoes.""  The one star is for the good customer service.",0
1984,5614,"Great ambiance, great staff and the food is delicious. Everything I've had here is amazing.",1
1985,5615,"Always love this place especially their Seabass, no other place makes it nearly as good as Dal Rae.  I have always celebrated my birthday is here, it's my favorite place to go because the food is always consistent.Wish that they have more Dine LA",1
1986,5616,"Great food, excellent service!  Dal Rae's was buzzing being the last day of Dine LA.  We were seated immediately,  greeted with our server taking our drinks order and a nice bread basket.  The table side service being discontinued since Covid was a small disappointment.  My filet was cooked perfect MR and was soooo tender-like slicing butter.  Mr B loved his NY and is still talking about it.  We shared the lemon cake but wished we had orders the sundae.  We will be back to try the Seafood offerings.",0
1987,5617,I've been coming here since I was a little girl and I've never been disappointed! Celebrated my friends birthday Friday night and had the Chilean Seabass and it was amazing! Can't forget the bread OMG  Can't wait to go back soon!,1
1988,5618,"I really love this place! It's a hidden gem of quality dining. It is a bit too pricey for a regular dinner, so I don't get to go often, but it's always my choice for any special occasion! The food and service are top notch. My favorite dish is the lamb chops. It is so very very yummy, I sometimes have dreams about eating it!Also, The interior decor they put up for the winter holidays last year was spectacularly done, so I will definitely be finding a reason to go back this winter. I highly recommend this place for nice night out!",0
1989,5619,"this place is more like a 3.5 out of 5 stars.again, i did pick up for dine la. I'm very glad some restaurants are allow you to order pick up from the dine la menu. when i got there, i noticed some people eating in the backyard patio and also some in the front patio.  i wonder when we'll be able to actually eat inside.I got the poor man pepper steak and the teriyaki tidbits.for lunch, you get 1 appetizer and 1 entree for 25 bucks. i believe you can add a dessert for another 7 bucks or so.The teriyaki tidbits were delicious, but the downside is that you can eat them in bite. If they give you bread like they did with me, you can dip some of the bread into the teriyaki sauce.  thank me later.The poor man pepper steak is essentially a large meatloaf. i was kinda surprised that they were going to give us a ""steak"" for only 25 bucks. But after eating it, its pretty much a over priced meatloaf.  Don't get me wrong, it was still tasty and filling. But its definitely not steak. I did like the fact they added peppercorn bacon.It also came with mashed potatoes and some veggies. The mashed potatoes were not as flavorful, but if you use some of the juice from the steak it's a nice addition.Overall, i think this place is more on the pricier side, but i'm glad they joined dine la so i can give it a try.",1
1990,5620,Poor man pepper steak is phenomenal!!!!!  Pepper steak is what they are famous for but both are great!!,1
1991,5621,"Great food! Poor service. I always try to make the best of it, but the service especially whom ever answers the phone up front, is always very rude.",0
1992,5622,"If I could put less than 1 star I would. We come here quite often and return because the it food is tasty BUT it never fails that they are rude and that is an understatement. It's not cheap and good tastes even better when you are treated like a guest. It's always the woman who answers or the owner/manager. Never will I ever spend another dime here. Sucks because we really ""DID"" enjoy the food and had big celebrations here. Oh well, I guess Steak and Stein's it is  from now on.",1
1993,5623,Excellent service and very good food.   Had a great time.  I ordered the Prime Rib and my wife had the Shrimp Boat.   Drinks were a Mai Tai and an Apple Martini.,0
1994,5624,"There is no better fine dining restaurant in the area. It's worth driving to for a great night out. Table side service for ceasar salad, steak diane just can't be beat. It's a fantastic dining experience and the lunch service is extremely good to take office staff out as well. The ownership and staff is the best there is.",0
1995,5625,"I visited Dal Rae for the 5th time on 9/14/2020 to introduce my daughter to her first ""classy steakhouse"" restaurant. It was our first family dinner during Covid and I was nervous about going out in general. I have to say I was thoroughly impressed with the set-up Dal Rae had. Their patio was really nice and tables were spread apart. We got lucky and no other tables were sat next to ours.The food was amazing like always. We went during Dine LA, all of us ordered the filet mignon and it was cooked perfectly. The dessert was delicious. My daughter loved everything about the experience. I'm glad there are still nice restaurants like Dal Rae where people in Los Angeles still dress up to go to.Giving it 4 stars because the service was slow to start, we were missing utensils for our bread/pickled veggies plate. Our server let us know that they weren't properly staffed for that night. I was surprised to see the restaurant be so busy for a Monday night but that tells you how great this place is.",0
1996,5626,"Eric the bartender took care of us. He was slammed and the only bartender for the both service and well . Meaning making all drinks for Bartop and restraunt. He did an amazing job keeping up on drinks and even under pressure had a great attitude , and took care of everything we needed. He delegated the bar and everything going on with urgency and patience as well. Our steak was a little over cooked but was handled amazingly . Could not be happier with the drinks, food and service provider on wed night . Thank you! Always love Del Rae , coming from someone that works in a competing fine dining restraunt I give it a 5 stars",0
1997,5627,"Food is good. Nothing mind blowing tho. As I was there there was a guy describing this place as being the ""Morton's"" of the area. Meh. It's cool not but not like that either. As I walked everyone including the hostess looked at me like I was not where I should be. I was dressed casual wearing jeans and a tshirt vs everyone around me being dressed up business casual or better. The hostess with a snobbish attitude told since I didn't have a reservation they couldn't help me. Unless I wanted to sit at the bar or course. I always opt for that area usually since it's faster. The waitress that helped was really helpful. A total 180 from the hostess. Waitress was super nice and talkative and didn't make me feel at all like I shouldn't be there. Forgot her name but she's an older lady and actually responded when I asked for a recommendation. I didn't like her recommendation but I still took it and was appreciative of her input.",1
1998,5628,"Will we return?... if its DINE LA, YES.The staff is ok. Drinks ok. Location... it's been here forever. Traffic sucks around 5 pm. The French onion soup is amazing. The bread is warm with a nice crunch but, the butter is too cold. I'd like room temp spreadable butter. The filet is tasty, just add a dash of salt. The sea bass is highly under rated and I almost sure it's Chilean, Cooked perfect. Parmesan crusted.The side of garlic mash was tasteful. Oh, and they leave a bottle of iced water at the table. For self service.",0
1999,5629,"I love Dal Rey they have  most delicious Prime Rib , everything on the menu is delicious and fresh ! We've haven't been out in quite sometime and this is the first time in over an Year and a half. They followed All the necessary protocols  to ensure the safety of their guests and Staff .",0
2000,5630,"Have been coming here for years!!! Delicious, I see famous people here all the time, lol. The food is Delicious !!!",1
2001,5631,Delicious ......what can you say Everything Perfect!! John our server was amazing went beyond our expectations,1
2002,5632,"Fantastic food! Good stuff, started out with an Espresso Martini which I never had before but I did like it. The dish I ordered was the Sea-Bass; it came with asparagus and the second side I chose was Mash Potatoes. The food really was excellent and I'll definitely go back sometime. The only reason it wasn't five stars for me is the waiter wasn't attentive plus everyone at the table noticed he forgot to enter our order after already waiting roughly about 7 minutes-ish.",0
2003,5633,"Food and service at the table was fantastic! Highly recommend the Brie, Prime Rib, and Lamb! The bartenders need some training on the classics. Also you'd think that if your going to charge $60 for a double of Whistle Pig at least DRY the (rocks) glass you serve it in!",0
2004,5634,"I came with my husband to celebrate his 28th birthday and we were excited until we arrived. Our server Enrique came over about 5 minutes after we sat, he never introduced himself we had to find his name out by reading the receipt. We never received drink menus, I had to ask a busser and still our server never came back or was even in the vicinity to call him until our food came, 30 minutes later. The ahi salad was delicious, my husband ordered his steak cooked medium but came medium rare, we kindly asked for it to be cooked more medium and it came back cooked medium rare again. Our server was not friendly. We contemplated walking out. Extremely disappointed, and definitely won't come back. We absolutely felt discriminated against for our age and race.",0
2005,5635,"It was my first time at Dal Rae and it was definitely a treat! We decided to try it out for the Dine LA week and it was worth it! I opted for the Crab Stuffed Artichoke as my appetizer, the Filet Mignon as my entree and the Sundae for dessert. Everything was just delicious and my steak was a PERFECT Medium Rare. So silky, so buttery to slice through. The Dine LA special is $55 per person. After tax and tip we spent about $80 each. We will come back when Dine LA hits again!!",0
2006,5636,"the food is incredibly expensive.  we went there the other night and in the past their garlic bread was good.  what they served instead was cheese bread.  everything is a la carte.  both times i have been there, i got a headache, as i suspect that their spices have msg in them.  perhapsl,l many years ago, the food was good and people felt that they were getting a fair deal.",1
2007,5637,"Great place to have an excellent steak.their salad as well as their side were excellent. This  is a good old fashion steak house, reminds you of a Mafia place.",0
2008,5638,"First time coming here and was disappointed with the main course. Ordered the stuffed mushrooms for the appetizer which were very good. My bf ordered Prime NY Steak medium well, I got the Filet Mignon Medallions med-well. Both our steaks were over cooked. The mashed potatoes tasted and looked like they were from a box. The asparagus and rice pilaf didn't have any flavor. Looked like they were just steamed with no seasoning.",0
2009,5639,"Enrique/Kike was our waiter & let me tell you... he was polite, entertaining & super courteous. He hosted my wives birthday dinner w family. He connected with us so graciously, I couldn't ask for anything more.",1

2011,5641,"Amazing food, especially the Sea Bass and Scallops. The mashed potatoes were alright - needed salt. Other than that, everything was delicious!",0
2012,5642,"I wish I could give a better rating but I was disappointed for sure. The food was good and the service was fine, not amazing but adequate.Here's the story. My husband and i made a dinner reservation about a month in advance, celebrating 12 year anniversary. We don't get out much, for lots reasons, so we're looking forward to a quiet, somewhat romantic grown up dinner. We arrived at our reservation time and the host began to walk us through the restaurant and OUT THE BACK DOOR to the parking lot tables.I don't know about you but when I'm going to drop a couple hundred dollars on dinner,, i don't want to sit in a cold ugly parking lot. Especially on my anniversaryWe declined the seating offer and were told we'd have to wait at least an hour for a table inside. Thought, no big deal we can have a cocktail in the bar and relax like grown-ups but were promptly told bar seating was not an option but we could buy a drink and wait out front with valet!!We decided to leave.As we were making our way to another restaurant we recieved a call (15 min later) that a table was available. We did get seated on our return but unfortunately we were seated at a 4 seater table (not a comfy booth) in the busy walkway in the middle of restaurant. I felt like I was on display on a runway.. Romantic conversation? Not a chance‍Will not likely go back.",0
2013,5643,"Only giving it a 4 star, not bc of food but felt 'rushed'. Ordered a cocktail b4 dinner to enjoy. Felt rushed to order. Halfway through our meal they were asking if we wanted boxes! No lie, 6 different times ppl came to take plates. We were there a total of 1 hour 20 minutes. When you are paying this amount for dinner/cocktails, being rushed is a no no. Wasn't  that crowded & it's a Tuesday. Understand bring 'attentive' but this was a bit much.",0
2014,5644,Great time. Nice ambiance. The hostess was very accomodating to us for our seating. Food was amazing.,0
2015,5645,"61st anniversary with a special menu to celebrate a birthday along with theirs. Food was excellent and service spot on again. Was a little crowded due to the special, but didn't slow down service. Just a little crowded with swat bumping into each other at times and some chair shuffling at times. Steak and prime rib was great though and we had a great time again.----------------Here for an early Father's Day dinner with the kids. They had a limited menu for Father's day even though it wasn't yet, but had most of the faves so we were ok. The one item they didn't have on the limited menu was the tomahawk but they made it for me anyway, which was cool.I been here many times over the years and the Dal Rae has never disappointed. The one time was on Valentine, but have learned to avoid the special occasions. In this case, it was the day before but the place was still packed and their overflow rooms were open and full as well. It gets a bit cozy during those times, but otherwise pretty much the same level of service you would expect at nice steak house.The prime rib was especially good this evening with the Chilean Sea Bass coming in a close second. Tomahawk was very good too, but may order the bone in rib eye next time to compare.Definitely a go to when I want steak and don't want to drive across town or Pasadena",0

2018,5648,"It's been years since I've been there and things change. Food was good and food quality was good plus the service was great which is very important to me. Of course this reflected in their price and if all hasn't changed, I would recommend...but only if it hasn't changed. It's was a Steakhouse in my opinion.",1
2019,5649,"I used to be a regular at the Dal Rae in Fullerton before they closed that location and have been to this Pico Rivera site but a few times as it's not too location friendly for me unless I happen to be in the area.  We were a party of three enjoying a birthday occasion and were fortunate to get a last minute booth on a very busy Friday.  Thank you Dal Rae for accommodating us on short notice.  We were seated promptly and our beverage order was taken while we were given time to drool over the extensive fare.The drinks arrived quickly and our food order was taken by our friendly waiter.  We ordered servings of the escargots bourguignonne and crab-stuffed artichoke bottoms to munch on accompanied by warm fresh bread.  The escargots were quite tasty and quickly disappeared.  The artichoke dish, not so much.  It just didn't pop for us.  Our birthday boy chose the 16 ounce cut of prime rib, medium rare, with sides of veggies and mashed potato.  The prime rib was perfectly cooked and as good as any of the ""big name"" prime rib houses.  The mashed potatoes came bare naked without even a side container of gravy to cover them with.  Mashed potatoes without gravy?  Uh...that's a no.One diner chose Dal Rae's signature pepper sauce filet mignon, and raved about the flavour party in her mouth with each bite.  The Chilean sea bass rounded out our group's choices, and did not disappoint either.  Our waiter kept our beverages topped of throughout our meal and checked in regularly on us.  I would rate this visit to Dal Rae a four and a half.  Serve gravy with the mashed potatoes and it goes to five.",0
2020,5650,"Oh Dal Rae, how I wanted to love you. You had been on my bucket list for years. My granddaughter and her boyfriend brought me here for my birthday on a rainy Sunday night. We had 8:00 reservations but had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. We could have waited in the bar but chose not to. We ordered drinks after being seated and they were very good.  We also ordered appetizers, crab stuffed mushrooms which had quite a few pieces of shell. I expect better from this type of establishment. The Ahi on toast was delicious. Calamari was neither hot nor crispy. Such a disappointment. Two of us ordered the combination of the most popular entrees, sea bass ala Ben and pepper steak, the other ordered the 16 ounce rib eye pepper steak. The flavor was spot on with the fish being the star. The problem was the food arrived barely lukewarm. This lies directly on our servers. We had two who were so friendly and welcoming but let our food sit until it was nearly cold. Our mistake was not saying anything! I doubt I'll ever go again.",0
2021,5651,"Our Family used to eat at the original Dal Rae on Western Avenue on Sunday nights.Famous Jockeys were there from Hollywood Park racetrack.It was run by the Brothers Ben and Bill Smith, the Fathers.It was the best of the best.The clientele was illustrious and the restaurant was absolutely the very best.",1
2022,5652,"If I could rate this place 10 stars I would. It's so good it should be on every ""must hit"" LA spot.The Dal Rae has served freight royalty for decades and the minute you step in, you feel like you're transported to a time where things were ""how they used to be"".The service from Robert today at lunch was incredible , the Caesar Salad + the Seabass and espresso to finish was a highlight of my week.Truly a place that takes you back in time and certainly not a place you go when you're in a rush, you'd be robbing yourself from the experience.",0
2023,5653,"I can't really fault this place. It's an institution. A piece of the Mad Men era frozen in time. When you eat here, you can pretend that you're Lesley Gore, Barbara Eden, or a member of the Rat Pack. And since my parents got married in that particular decade, this is where we took them to celebrate their anniversary. First thing's first: the service is excellent. Very few establishments can boast service is good as this. Every single member of staff is attentive, friendly, and helpful. And the food? Oh boy, the food. I ordered the prime rib, medium rare, with asparagus spears and garlic mashed potatoes. To be fair, the garlic mashed could have used more garlic but I was so happy with the temperature of the meat (this is one of the few places that gets temperatures right) and everything else was so flavorful that I can overlook the lack of garlic (I'm a bit of a garlic fiend anyway and not everyone likes it as much). The appetizers we ordered beforehand, oysters Rockerfeller and fried calamari, were also exellent. And the parentals were also happy with their entrees, especially my extremely picky mom who really, really enjoyed her sea bass. If you also happen to have a picky pescaterian mother, bring here. They have great seafood options and she will not be disappointed.",0
2024,5654,Very odd location off of a busy street and in somewhat sketchy neighborhood. But it totally works!! From the inside this restaurant has been around since the days of the mafia. My business colleague and I kept expecting Al Capone or some other famous mafia person to sit down for dinner. I love that the owners are able to keep this vibe alive and well in an uncertain time for most restaurants. The menu is very broad and sticks to its roots of delivering high quality food with a 1920s flair. I ordered the sea bass which was cooked perfectly just a little too much lemon butter for my liking. My partner has the prime rib bone in and it was huge!! Dal Rae is known locally for their prime rib so I strongly suggest giving it a try. The cocktails were made perfectly served in a crystal martini glass and the service was top notch. Expect to pay a little bit more but it is worth it for the food and experience.,0
2025,5655,One of the few really special restaurants left! The interior is a throwback to the 5060 with the great nostalgic looking chandeliers. The wait staff all look elegant in there uniforms. The decorations are amazing. But the best thing of all is the food... Oh my gosh the food! I had shark and I have to say it was the best shark I've ever had. One of my friends had filet mignon stroganoff and there are no words to describe the burst of flavor on your mouth when you taste it. And the mashed potatoes? How did they get them to taste so good? We had brie cheese as an appetizer with bread and buffalo garlic! And it was absolutely incredible. We were there to celebrate my birthday and it took me back to a time when we all slow down and did special things for special people. I can't think my friends enough for taking me there and I can't think the restaurant enough for treating me like a queen. Definitely a must do!,0
2026,5656,"Nice old school steakhouse. Dim lighting and I've seen a pianist or some type of live entertainment. If you're not a big steak person, Chilean sea bass is prepared nicely here, try it a la ben.",1
2027,5657,"Yesterday we got to try out the steakhouse Dal Rae in Whittier. Unfortunately the experience we had was not the best compared to many other restaurants we've been to. If you're expecting to have a good steakhouse experience unfortunately you will not find it here.Starting with the service! The hostess at the front was probably the only friendly individual we spot to. She sat us down at our table and after that we did not speak to our waiter until 15 minutes later. After we placed our order the only time our waiter ever came to ""check"" on us was when he brought the food to our table.Now on to food! The only good thing we had that evening was their Brie with pesto and garlic. It saved the day. It took almost 40 minutes just for us to get 1 French onion soup. Which is supposed to be a appetizer/starter. The soup wasn't the best but it also wasn't the worst. It was very average. You can now imagine how long it took for us to get our tomahawk steak. We waited over almost an hour and a half just for our entree. The worst part was it wasn't very good either. I assumed after waiting for so long they would have done an amazing job with the dish but we were very disappointed. The steak was undercooked to our order, under seasoned, and poorly executed. If I showed you the sides that it came with you would probably not order those as well. Now I generally order dessert when I try a new restaurant but I didn't want to when I was here. I was afraid we would have to wait another 30 minutes just to get our dessert.All in all our experience was extremely poor. The only reason I would give this place a 2/5 is because of the Brie cheese with pesto. Other then that from service, most of the food, and our experience it was really a 1/5. I don't know if I would come back to give Dal Rae another shot. But if I do I hope our experience would be a complete 180 from the one we had.Note: I think there is only valet parking which is $6.",0
2028,5658,"Excellent restaurant. I had the opportunity to dine at this restaurant on a Friday evening. My reservations were at 8:30pm. It is valet parking for $6 for dinner. I entered and the restaurant was very lively with music in the bar area. There was a gentleman on the electric piano playing a variety of music. We were escorted to our seats. The lights are dim and the decor is nice but dated. We were greeted by several people that offered water , bread and then a menu. The waiter Richard was very attentive. He provided us with options and suggestions. We had Filet Mighon.The steak was great. It was a nice sized portion with mash potatoes and vegetables. The dessert was also pretty big and delicious. We had the cheesecake and the chocolate cake. I would definitely return and highly recommend",0
2029,5659,Dal Rae never disappoints! They still keep up their quality food. You get what you pay for and this restaurant is not definitely cheap. You end up with a good bill after a great dinner. It is what it is.,1
2030,5660,"We took our daughter here for her birthday and I am so happy that We did. The ambiance was wonderful. We sat down and could hear live music coming from the bar so we snuck around to see and it was so delightful to see lady musician playing a piano and singing. The food was so yummy. I had the lobster that was cooked to perfection. I voted that our family is to come here at least 1x a month!!!  Our waitress was exceptional, friendly, and made us feel right a home. Thank you for this great first time experience.",0
2031,5661,"Arrived to Dal Rae Valet Parking $6 not bad at all, walked in no reservation was seated quick for a table of 2 on a Tuesday. Great servers right away asked how our day was and if we need it anything I ordered a old fashion my wife looked at the drink menu for a minute. When the server came back again my wife had the Paloma and server said she will bring bread for the table. The bread is horrible it was hard. Server asked what side we will have we had calamari and crab cake. The calamari was horrible all the bread crumbs came off the crab cake was great. Now to the entrees I had the ny strip with the famous bacon onion paper corn sauce and my wife the 12 oz filet with the sauce as well. Be prepared to get a lot of spiciness with the peppercorn crust they cook the steak amazingly if you order a medium rare steak that's what you are going to get steak are cooked great and great quality meat the sauce I will not recommend even though they say it's from the 50s the restaurant. If I would go again I will order the steak with out a pepper corn crust and put the bacon onion sauce on the side it would have enhanced the experience better. Over all it's an old school steak house but it cost the same as going to a Morton's Mastros Meat on the Ocean Flemings Nothing special I feel it's a novelty for the locals which I'm from Montebello pictured below is the ny strip I highly recommend get everything on the side and keep the steak which is delicious by it self no peppercorn crust too spicy takes away the juiciness/flavor",0
2032,5662,"Started with the fried zucchini and I must say one of the best I've had so far. For my entree I had the bone in prime rib-eye steak, and it was the best steak my palette has ever experienced! Cooked just the way I wanted! Topped off with a freshly made chocolate soufflé, ooooueee! The best part was the great customer service provided. Always good to have 5 star service while enjoying a great dinner! Thank you Del Rae Restaurant for the amazing experience!",0
2033,5663,"One of the best steak house in the southern california area. I have never hand a bad experience here on the food. There has been a few times that the waitresses and hostess don't really have a welcoming attitude. Besides that, the food is amazing. I still give them a 5 due to coming to Del Rae at least 20 times or more.",1
2034,5664,"We've been to Ruth's Chris. We've been to Hugo's Cellar, Fleming's and Houston's.Dal Rae is far superior in cuisine. Maybe not service, which is , but as far as food...TOP NOTCH.Before dinner we sat at the bar and had drinks. I had a Saphire Martini, while my special lady friend had a Cucumber martini (which isn't really a martini but I'm not gonna say anything about that now) and we watched what seems to be a cast of characters straight out of a 1960's episode of Manix. Seriously.Pinky rings and ascots. Slicked back hair and pony tails. Martinis and old fashioneds. The guy at the Casio in the corner was singing and playing some old school jams...KRLA type oldies. There was lots of blue hair dancing and swooning to the music.We got called to our table. Sat down and perused the menu.I got the pepper steak. She had the surf and turf. We got a Ceasar salad which was awesome because some guy who reminds me of a guy named Jimmie from a mob film mixed it up right there...with anchovies paste and raw eggs...the real deal.  The food came out.HOLY MOLEY. Our waitress asked when I ordered how I liked my steak. I told her a middle bit more than medium rare, and quite a bit south of Medium. She said ""medium rare +!"" She nailed it. It came out perfect.Seriously the best steak I've ever had. It actually MELTED in my mouth. It was a HUGE cut of filet mignonette. The asparagus and baked potato were a perfect pairing.Dessert was bananas foster and she had a soufflé that took 30 minutes. It took 30 minutes because they make them fresh ! The bananas foster was prepared right in front of us...I was so full, but the food was so good I couldn't stop eating !This place is a throwback to a different time. It's a classy joint. It's cold martinis and awesome steaks. It's loungy and slick. It ain't cheap.Go here",0
2035,5665,Over crowded. No social distancing. Food was so so .Not like before Covid. Didn't even have my favorite breads like they used too.,1
2036,5666,Amazing place with a great staff. Very classy and the meat i ordered was so juicy and tender. You can tell that these folks only get the best ingredients and meat cuts for their clientele. Will definitely come back on my next date with my fiancé.,0
2037,5667,"Love this place. I've been coming here for years snd the food is always consistent. Same owners, all family owned and you can tell it has a family feel when you walk right in. The staff is beyond wonder and so accommodating. And the food is always so yummy!Oysters Rockefeller is so yummy! And,The sea bass is beyond fabulous that I highly recommend.Caesar salad so good!I don't eat red meat so I can't give you a recommendation for that.I highly recommend this restaurant!10 plus stars for me.",0
2038,5668,Amazing ambiance... drinks and food is A1!! Kinda hard to get reservations so book early... Can't wait to go back.. Oh and that butter cake.... I need the recipe!! Delish,0
2039,5669,"UYE organized by Super Yelper Isobel L. on Halloween 2018 where we wore costumes to the gentle coaxing of getting a free dessert by the organizer. Fun time was had by all including some of the staff in our costume picture taking session avant dîner.I came to Dal Rae in 2012 before their interior design renovation. Although the touch up was necessary, I do miss the overhead huge light fixtures shaped like flying saucers covered in colored fabric. However, the spirit of mid 20th century still lives on.This urbane steakhouse exudes a ""Mad Men"" like atmosphere. Frank, Dean, Sammy and the rest of the Rat Pack would be more than at home here. Woven fabric is plentiful so that the ambient sounds are quickly absorbed into a whisper.  I appreciate Dal Rae even more in retaining the sophisticated touches of the higher end restaurants of our parents when I compare some of our contemporary restaurants that roar with cacophony just to prove that they are happening party centrals.  Old fashioned veggie crudité, rustic whole wheat bread, thick crunchy flat bread, sweet butter.I ordered slightly off menu this time by getting a Rib Eye Pepper Steak Bone In with a coating of finely chopped green onions, crushed pepper corn, bits of bacon, splash of red wine based Sauce Bordelaise with the Madagascar Green Pepper Sauce on the side.Super fantastic flavour & texture combination that totally satisfies the carnivore instincts. The med rare rib eye is meaty w/ a satisfying, meaty chaw and grass fed beefiness.Everytime you chew into the steak, a fatty beef Umami seeps out to make love to your tongue. Buttery, the rib eye then melts in your mouth with a moist, rich velvety finish. The onions, black & gastric blessed green pepper smoky aromatics join in to supplement to this carnal symphony.A red Shiraz from the Barossa Valley, better known as Syrah to non Australians, was smooth, plumy, black berry jammy. Acidic, touch of oak tannin to balance the sweetness. Good pairing to contrast to the meaty, peppery, fattiness.  Short of the hyper premium A-5 Wagyu- (wah ghee yu) from such places as Kagoshima, Miyagi, Ko-bè (koh beh) experienced in places such as Kinjiro- in Little Tokyo, and one star Guide Michelin Keiko in SFO, this Dal Rae special order is the best I have had for a great deal in the $50 range. Only the Australian Wagyu- cooked by white oak at the Royce came close for a comparable price.The regal, puffy Soufflé de Chocolat had a pronounced chocolaty tone. Gravy boats of Orangey Grand Marnier Crème Anglaise, a strong vanilla chocolate sauce, and Crème  Chantilly were solid accompaniments.The Bananas Flambé was executed by a nattily dressed gentleman where fruits, butter, brown sugar were sautéed in a long handled pan. Amaretto, banana liqueur, brandy, rum to create  high, flickering flames. Shaved almonds for nutty texture. Dramatic showmanship to conclude the extravagant meal.Thanks to Yelpers Isobel L., Kim T., Ran C., Jim W. for wonderful company. Also Eileen, our veteran waitress who orchestrated our meal, was friendly, thoughtful, kind and fun.  5- stars.Long may Dal Rae reign.",0
2040,5670,"A truly classic and classy mid century steakhouse when cars had rocket fins and dagmar bumpers, and Marilyn Monroe was still queen of the silver screen.  When I entered the darkened restaurant from the brightness of a noon day sun, my eyes adjusted to the darkness and was floored by the authentic interior design that has not been changed since the late 1950's.  There were huge light fixtures shaped like flying saucers covered in colored fabric.  Thick leather covered booths around the perimeter. Woven fabric was plentiful so that the ambient sounds are quickly absorbed into a whisper.  I'm beginning to appreciate the sophisticated touches in the higher end restaurants of our parents when I compare some of our contemporary restaurants that roar with cacophony just to prove that they are happening party centrals.  I ordered the Pepper steak which is a thick piece of  grilled filet mignon with a coating of finely chopped green onions, crushed pepper corn, and bits of bacon.  It was just the right size so you didn't feel overly stuffed.  Our waitress was personable and wanted to let us have a good dining experience.  We even traded favorite local places to eat other than at Dal Rae.  This  was lunch so I wanted to keep it light, but I noticed there were many ""old school"" 1950's cuisine such as Oysters Rockefeller, Lobster Thermidor, Bananas Foster (Wow, Flambé!!!), and other dishes considered to be sophisticated back in the day.  I will have to return to sample some of their archival recipes of a by gone era.  This urbane steakhouse exudes a ""Mad Men"" like atmosphere. Frank, Dean, Sammy and the rest of the Rat Pack would be more than at home here.  Long may Dal Rae reign.",1
2041,5671,"Went to the Dal Rae the other night after reading numerous best of LA reviews. I typically don't buy into all the hype but this place was great. The Dal Rae represents all that is great about fine dining -- attentive service, excellent wine and cocktail list, expertly cooked mid-West beef and melt in your mouth lobster.  It's the kind of place you go when you want to  impress a client or an out of town guest.",0
2042,5672,It had been at least 15 years since I ate here. The food is as good as ever. I am glad I made a reservation for a Wednesday night as it was packed. I had the pepper steak filet specialty and it was fantastic. They offer a large selection of sides with all meals other than pasta dishes. Service is excellent. Valet parking only.,0
2043,5673,"Came here to have dinner on a date night with my husband. The service was outstanding. Enrique was our server and he was super friendly very personable very funny.We enjoyed our evening we had the Alfredo pasta and the Australian lobster, the food was amazing would highly recommend coming here and treating yourself to a lovely dinner.",0
2044,5674,"Food was amazing but service from the beginning with waitress Sara was terrible. I've never experienced anything like that in my life. My husband and I paid with our debit card and he tipped her CASH. I clearly heard her tell my husband ""oh thank you"" when he handed her the tip. Reason we did not leave a tip with our debit card is because my husband did not want her to have to split that tip with all the other servers (he was a server before). Clearly him trying to be a nice guy wasn't the best decision. After walking out of the restroom Sara approaches me to ask if anything was wrong with her service. Confused I say ""no...why??"" and she opens her check book to show me that I didn't tip her. So I said ""my husband tipped you cash"" and with attitude and sarcasm she responds  ""no he didn't. look"" (she goes on to open her check book to show me her tips as if i know which cash is the tip we left her). We spoke to the manager and another waitress about this incident so i can only hope they address this to Sara because that was really disrespectful, rude, and wrong. We have nothing to hide and they can gladly check their cameras to see that we did in fact tip her even with her dry, unwelcoming service. Do better Sara.",0
2045,5675,"To say this place is amazing is an understatement. This is probably the best Caesar salad I've ever had and you order it for two people. I ordered the pepper steak which was really good. The quality of the meat, the way it was cooked and served were all phenomenal. My mother had the sea bass allá Ben.  Needless to say, they bring sea bass to a whole other level.  And for dessert, tiramisu and creme brûlée. My absolute favorite. We brought a great bottle of wine (corkage fee applied) and we were beyond satisfied. Definitely one of the best steak houses I've been to and will definitely go back. The service was amazing. VALET ONLY",0
2046,5676,Great food. The best in Pico Rivera.  Excellent place to have a nice lunch or dinner.  You won't be disappointed,1
2047,5677,old school gem. great food great drinks and the desserts are amazing. surf and turf (filet and chilean sea bass) is the best around,0
2048,5678,This place is by far my favorite local restaurant! The food is always fresh and full of flavor. From the veggie platter to the cesar salad made at table side to the peppered steak. All of it is delicious! The martinis are always on point as well as the customer service. I can see how this place has been around so long! Highly reccomended!,0
2049,5679,"This restaurant is the best! It has great food with huge portions, and excellent service. I highly recommend.",1
2050,5680,"Great portions for the price and great food. I tried the ex car go for the first time ever. It was really well cooked apparently. I loved all the appetizers from the sushi to the Oyster. We were given cheese bread (my favorite) But!!! They weren't cheezy enough or buttery enough, didn't live up to the one I love from sizzlers. But it was decent. If you need a spot for a date without blowing a budget this is a great spot.",1
2051,5681,"Celebrating a special event, we decided to have dinner at the venerable Dal Rae, in business since 1951!They are well known for their Prime Rib and also their Pepper Steak.This is a classic restaurant...table side prepared Caesar or Bacon Spinach salads, large portions, a tremendous wine list and Bananas Flambé or Cherries Jubilee, also also prepared at your table.Entrees are about $50 each. The portions are generous, so I would consider sharing next time.The staff and management are very professional and provide excellent service. The place was packed...reservations a must.For a special evening, this is a place you won't forget!",0
2052,5682,"Went here on a Sunday night just after thanksgiving. Pulled into parking lot and were greeted by the valet($5) who parked our cars. We had reservations for 8 so we were seated at a rather large table. The dining room was decorated nicely for the holidays.They have a nice wine and alcohol selection. I opted for my favorite Blantons neat while my date had a side car. Both were delicious but they could have poured a shot and half for the price they charged.  Others got regular cocktails. The house red was good as well.We all opted for the table side Ceaser salad app even though they had banned romaine lettuce that week. Table side service was nice. The dressing itself was really good. Ours was served with ice berg which detracted from the overall experience. Not sure if it was just because of the ban or not but the salad itself was more of an entree portion than a side salad. The others at our table could not get enough of the cheeses bread served with the salad.  I had to stop myself from finishing the salad to save room for my steak.Other at our table opted for the steak Diane. Which is cooked table side as well. They use a lot of butter for this dish. A LOT OF BUTTER. Playing of the Diane was nice, they warm each plate and portions are pretty good for this dish. Tasted good but the sauce was too rich for me. I got the pepper filet medium rare. Mine was cooked more medium but with a group of 8 I wasn't going to send it back. This particular pepper steak is covered in onions. It's a really good cut and nice portion size. But in all honesty it could have used less onions and been cooked better. My dates rib eye was much tastier but was also over cooked as well.For dessert we shared the 2 soufflés. The Chocolate one was by far the tables favorite. We also got the coffee l with the 7 different liquors. Not sure what's in it but it will give you a buzz.Overall nice atmosphere and good quality ingredients, they tend to over cook their steaks. Try the cheese bread, and soufflé. FYI Table side service is not available in December.  For the price I was expecting a better cooked and presented steak.",0
2053,5683,"Out of all the places in Pico Rivera, I was surprised by the fact that I had to valet my car. During lunch time, it costs $4.50. During dinner time, it costs $6.00. The only reason why I know this is because I walked into the restaurant at one price and it changed as I left.We primarily came here to have drinks. Looking through the Yelp photographs of this restaurant, I'd be compelled to return in the near future to actually try the food. It was a nice place to hang out at the bar and have a couple of beers. In case you were wondering, I had the Ballast Point Sculpin IPA. They gave me the option of drinking it from the glass or from the bottle. I wish they could have chilled the glass though, so I may opt for the cold bottle next time.I noticed that during dinner time, there was live music which is an added bonus. Can't wait to come back again in the near future.",1
2054,5684,Simply delicious!!! I highly recommend the filet mignon and the butter cake is dreamy!,1
2055,5685,"My boyfriend and i are always on the hunt for a good steak!We made reservations for Friday night not knowing what to expect.Our table wasn't ready so waited at the bar and ordered some well made Washington Apple's. The atmosphere was upbeat and the live performer was neat.Our waitress Carrie was awesome. She went above and beyond with her services. She was very helpful and Sweet.We ordered two popular dishes, The Peppered Filet Mignon and The Bone in Ribeye which my BF wouldnt stop raging about it!The Peppered Filet Mignon was WOW.  i I ordered it medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly.Sweet Carrie ended our night with a Gold Brick Sunday that was delicious.Thank you Carrie will be coming back soon!!!",0

2057,5687,"Celebrated my birthday at Dal Rae with another couple. All four of us are Dal Rae fans and love to celebrate special occasions here.This visit was very nice just like the rest of our visits.  The food was consistent and ambiance was great.  ON this last visit what was disappointing was the service.  It felt as if our server was in a terrible hurry.  If you've been to Dal Rae you know they are always busy.  So, staff should be used to the fact that every table is going to full.Lastly, I was disappointed when we ordered the bananas foster and cherries jubilee that were described as ""flambé table side"" on the menu. We were taken aback when our waiter told us they were going to flambe in the nearby hallway leading to the kitchen? You can see in the attached photo that the preparation is NOT table side. Isn't that kinda strange? Why would they say table side? They may as well have prepared them in the kitchen.",0
2058,5688,Amazing food and the ambience makes a date night great! Staff is very attentive and friendly. We've been here several times and will continue to bring our friends and family.,0
2059,5689,It's good at the restaurant but never grub hub from them. Driver waited 40 min and the order still wasn't ready. I ordered it early during the day so there was no excuse on why it should have been late. Terrible.,0
2060,5690,"Like you I have been coming to the Dal Rae for many years. This is the place to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, promotions and relationships. Walking into the dining room at the Dal Rae is like walking into a movie set. Goodfellas comes to mind. Being led to your seat in the dining room is an experience reserved for us Southern California Natives and it is truly amazing. So when my friend and his wife invited my wife and I to dinner at the Dal Rae we were elated. After years of dealing with Covid restrictions we were so excited to visit the Dal Rae and take the walk into the dining room once again and enjoy a great dinner. Our reservation was set at 5:30pm on a Saturday, we wanted to get in early and soak in the ambiance. We arrived a bit early and ordered drinks at the bar. Four drinks for $78 bucks! But my thought was ""Hey we are at the Dal Rae, what the hell let's roll with it"" at 5:30 on the nose we check in. We were all there waiting with anticipation as we walked towards the dining room. Only to make a quick right turn away from the dining room into an area that looked like a hotel lobby. There were seats and mediocre décor, no ambiance, no sizzle, no Dal Rae magic? I was confused and so was everyone else at the table. We all looked at each other like ""are we on candid camera?"" It was literally like planning a trip to Disneyland only to be told when you arrive that all of the main attractions are closed. So we decided to ask the lady at the front desk if we could sit in the main dining room. Surely this wasn't too much to ask for. My friend went first and he was told it would take an additional hour? He came back with the answer and we discussed our options. So I decided to go up and try my luck. I asked the same lady with blonde curly hair and glasses, ""Hey is there any chance we can sit in the main dining room? We have been waiting years to eat here and we really want to sit in the main dining room."" She very rudely quipped, ""We have 413 reservations. Too many people ask to be in the main dining room so the owners did away with it and you basically sit where there is availability. It is now 2 to 2  1/2 hours if you want to wait since you are a party of 6."" I said we are a party of 4 and we just got here. It didn't matter to her. She was annoyed and dismissive. This was not the Dal Rae I was used to. I felt duped, let down and down right misled. I had no idea this ""patio"" was even part of the restaurant it was designed as an afterthought. You talk about night and day, wow. Needless to say we were stuck. We made the best of it and decided this would be the last time we would eat here. The years of Dal Rae charm and mystique was erased just like that. We even had a chance to talk to the manager, Lauren I think his name is. And wouldn't you know it He had the same cued up response. ""We have 413 reservations so......"" What does that have to do with anything? If someone is okay with sitting out in the patio great and if someone is not, they should be accommodated. I don't care how many reservations you have that has nothing to do with us. I write this because I was completely let down, duped and we honestly didn't get what we paid for. It isn't the food at the Dal Rae I can get a steak anywhere. it is the entire Dal Rae Experience that makes this place special. I don't want anyone else to be let down. If you make a reservation at the Dal Rae just know that you are not guaranteed a table in the main dining room. It is now a lottery system and you can't request the main room. ""They don't do that anymore"" (Their words not mine) and when you get there and you are led to an alternate dining area other than the main dining room don't ask for a change because you will be met with disregard as we were 3 times. Lastly it isn't the same experience in the alternate area. It was like sitting at the kids table at thanksgiving watching all of the grownups eat at the main table. The service isn't the same and sadly the Dal Rae isn't the same. Won't be back. My rating was based on customer service, dinner service and overall experience.",1
2061,5691,"Celebrating birthdays for both my MIL and myself last weekend, took a group of 8 for family dinner. Oh my God, the service is SO good, very attentive without bugging us.

2064,5694,"Stop scrolling right now.If you haven't dined at the Dal Rae restaurant, then you haven't dined.To say I'm obsessed with the entire Dal Rae experience is an understatement. Between the classic, old school vibe and decor, to the tableside made dishes of their famous Caesar Salad, Bananas Foster, and Steak Diane, to their amazingly crisp martinis, and to their live piano music... you feel like you have been transported back to the golden age of Hollywood!My husband and I dined at the Dal Rae with another couple pre-Covid and it has been the one restaurant I have been dreaming about going back to! They are offering take out, which I have greatly enjoyed, but so looking forward to dining at this timeless spot in person again!",0
2065,5695,"First time here. Food is really good and service is good. Tonight it seemed like they where running a bit behind, but that's understandable. I don't like the idea of having to pay 6 dollar for parking when it's next to the restaurant.  You need to tip for valet too. Very good service.  The drinks, I ordered a Cadillac Margarita and my wife a Paloma. Both drinks where just too strong, it wasn't balanced well.",1
2066,5696,"Dal Rae is one of the last of that breed of elegant Classic restaurants of a bygone era.  When you walk in, you are transported to a time of elegance, the energy is contagious, the service is perfection, and the food is divine.  We discovered Dal Rae years ago when searching for the best Duck a l'Orange.  While perusing the menu, we were impressed with dishes like chateaubriand for two, steak Diane, lobster thermador and an incredible house pepper steak that takes the dish to another level with green onions and bacon.  Several dishes are prepared table side ~ remember trying to impress that special date?Erin, our cocktail waitress remembered us from previous visits, and our main server Dawn was a consummate pro having worked at the Brown Derby.  The staff was in tune with each other, and we were treated like Royalty.  It was a furiously busy night, but all of us felt special, appreciated and the stress of having to serve over 500 dinners did not show up on any of them.There is not a dish that won't be excellently prepared (we have eaten through their menu).  Some of our highlights and favorites:  a perfect Knob Creek old fashion, some of the best Oysters Rockefeller with just the right amount of Pernod, spinach and Hollandaise.  The house dressing has changed but is terrific ~ a mayo based, anchovy, capers and hard boiled egg was memorable.  That night, the combo of their special pepper steak and an incredibly tasty Chilean sea bass was excellent.  Fresh abalone from Morro Bay was tender and delectable. They even have chocolate and grand mariner soufflés which they politely remind you to order during dinner so they are prepared at the right time.One note of caution:  during the Holiday season they go on a limited menu with some of the house favorites, but we like to be able to pick from the amazing diverse selection.As usual, this was a meal to remember.  In fact we're going again tonight to introduce some good friends to this very special place.",1
2067,5697,The absolute most overrated restaurant I've ever been to.  The place looks run down and the food really sucks.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because although not great the staff tried their best.,1
2068,5698,"My family and I recently went to Dal Rae and it was my first time. I used to work in a restaurant as a chef so I can be a bit critical of the details. This place was very impressive. Not only was everyone super happy with the food but the service was excellent. I know that the food is the main thing but to me the customer service can spoil the experience. I felt like I do when I go on a cruise, as if I was an honored guest. From the initial contact with the hostess to the table settings and friendly manner of all the staff, I felt very taken care of. One can tell that the management trains everyone well. At the end of the meal the Manager came by to be sure we were happy and satisfied. You'll love it and reservations are a must because the place was packed! You must try it.",0
2069,5699,My favorite steak house! Honestly I have been here over 10 times and I always have such a good experience. The food is AMAZING!! I love the New York pepper corn steak with the baked potato .. Besides the food EVERYONE here is so nice and welcoming. I definitely recommend this place,1
2070,5700,I came here for the first time and let me say it was amazing!  The atmosphere was just what we liked and the food and drinks were awesome.  I had the bone in prime rib with their pepper sauce and French onion soup and it was delicious.  Jackie was our waitress and she was great!  Ended the evening with their golden ice cream and an espresso martini.  Wow!!,0
2071,5701,"Oh my gwarsh! What a meal! I came here tonight with my music  partner Wayne Ingram to celebrate us finishing recording and mixing our Christian Alt/Rock/Worship album that will be release on 1/3/20 called Living Love. We both got the Pepper Filet. Man a perfect steak. Juicy. It was melt in your mouth tender and I got the pepper sauce on the side because to me a steak doesn't need sauce but man it complimented the filet  perfectly. The side we're amazing, baked potato and sautéed spinach. So so good.Now the staff; Lydia was our waitress and she was a total delight, she also use to go to my church, Lake Ave in Pasadena. She was helpful and friendly and just wonderful. I love going into restaurants where the staff is a well oiled machine and they were all on top of it here. Our bus boy was so attentive that he ever made sure our water glasses were never empty.A great evening with my friend and buddy with amazing food. You can't beat that!",0
2072,5702,"Came here for my one year anniversary, great service, above reproach.Get the Oysters Rockefeller, and be prepared to have a life altering experience",1
2073,5703,"When it comes to steakhouses, my boyfriend and I are always on the hunt for a new favorite. We came here to enjoy lunch with my boyfriend's parents (who have been raving about this place).They had told us the prime rib was very good. Unfortunately they only serve that on Thursday and Friday.First off, they serve unlimited bread and butter to all the guests. You can never go wrong with bread and butter :)I went ahead and ordered the Prime Wagyu Flat Iron Steak. I replaced the asparagus with brocolli and paired with the mashed potatoes. The steak itself had a seasoning that was bitter and bit strong. I tried to wipe off as much of the seasoning as I could when eating it. The broccoli was very plain and bitter, but you can't ask for much more when you order steamed broccoli. The mashed potatoes were the perfect amount of creamy and starchy.My boyfriend ordered the Prime Rib French Dip. He was craving the prime rib and found his way to get it. He said it was very tasty, well-cooked, and well-seasoned. The fries were very good as well.I would definitely come back to try out other dishes. I was told the sea bass was very good.Tip: my boyfriend and his mom started the lunch with some white Russians and said they were very strong!I would definitely recommend this place!",0
2074,5704,The absolute BEST steak and shrimp scampi I've ever had! Everything was amazing! Drinks are stiff and service was great!,1
2075,5705,"I'm town visiting family and my gf had an idea to have a special Xmas eve dinner, having never been to this establishment despite growing up in the area we came here on her recommendation. If we could give half stars on tell  this place would be 3.5, but since we cannot I give it a 4.The location is very intimate, so that was very nice. A decent place for a date, the staff was very friendly. The manager would visit and check on us, and the waiter was doing a great job making sure we were taken care of (refilling drinks, preparing the table for each course, etc).The appetizers (oyster Rockefeller, and jumbo crab cake). oyster Rockefellers were ok, to be honest, they tasted like a pepperoni pizza. Jumbo crab cake was delicious. Super moist and flavorfulOur entrees (short rib, lobster Thermidor). Short rib was ok. To be honest, the short rib tasted like a pot roast more than a short rib, it came with garlic mash that was tasty. The lobster Thermidor was actually pretty delicious . There was succulent pieces of lobster in every bite.Overall it was a nice experience, but I would not be in a rush to go back.",1
2076,5706,"My first experience at this old school steakhouse was wonderful and I wanted to visit it again to celebrate the Christmas holidays.  Dal Rae is beautifully decorated for Christmas and honestly, nicely lightens the place up when normally it is too dark to even read the menu.  The place was packed with holiday parties and fellow diners.  I ordered the Prime Rib and it looked absolutely mouthwatering and enticing.  When I cut into the meat, though, the temperature was wrong.  The requested medium rare was more medium.   After a few bites, I also found the texture of the meat to be a bit mushy and soft throughout.  When the meat texture is off, the meat was probably incorrectly frozen and/or wet aged.  It was very disappointing and the wait staff was happy to replace my order with something else which I chose their signature Chilean Sea Bass.  Unfortunately, the fish too was cooked about 60 seconds too long and the sauce was so oily that it seaped into the fish.    Dal Rae is probably the only fine dining restaurant in the immediate area that many visit for special occasions.  With high expectations, this recent visit was a bit of a letdown of what it could have been.",0
2077,5707,"Nice restaurant...the food is wonderful.  Nice place to go for an anniversary dinner, birthday dinner.",1
2078,5708,"A throwback classy restaurant with outstanding door, drinks and service. Highly recommend",0
2079,5709,"Their food, regardless of what you order, or how busy they are, is always delicious & presentable.We love coming here.Just thinking about the Chilean sea bass, their mashed potatoes and their prime rib makes my mouth water!Definitely worth the cost",0
2080,5710,"Restaurant has an old school classy vibe with exceptional cuisine. Been here twice now and I love this place for the ambience, friendly service, and food and drink options.",1
2081,5711,"The city of Pico Rivera is a small working class neighborhood. It is full of history and many unique eateries. Besides finding several fast food restaurants as well as establishments that serve authentic Mexican food, you will find one place that has been in the area for years!Dal Rae Restaurant is a hidden gem in a city that has gone through a lot of changes. It is located on the corner of Washington Blvd and Lakewood Blvd. Dal Rae is also east of the 605 freeway off of the Washington Blvd exit. The restaurant itself is a little hidden so look for the large signage that extends high above the building.Parking is a little difficult because the only option seems to be to use the valet. We parked in the parking lot across the street by Walgreens and walked over to the restaurant. Don't even think about parking at Jack in the Box adjacent to Dal Rae because your car will be towed.Anyway, the restaurant itself has been in the area for MANY years. It always looked the same whenever we passed by so it seems like they have kept that classic look. When you walk inside, you'll notice that they continued to stay true to character. It's not modern in any way, shape, or form. Dal Rae is dimly lit inside and it is hard to see where you are going. It's also small, which would explain whey reservations are highly recommend.The menu selections are heavy on the red meat side mixed in with some chicken and fish offerings. My mom went all out and ordered the filet mignon. I honed in on the halibut as it's my favorite fish to eat! My husband opted for roasted duck. We also ordered a side serving of scalloped potatoes.While we waited for our meals to arrive, a bread basket was brought to our table. There was a nice assortment of bread with some being crispy like pie crust and others were soft in texture. Soon after, a silver dish with chilled vegetables on a bed of ice was placed on our table. I wasn't too keen on jalapeños and so on but it was a beautiful display.It didn't take too long for our meals to arrive. Mom said that her filet mignon was great and it was cooked just the way that she liked it! My halibut was nice and flakey with a sauce that complimented its natural flavor. My husband like the roasted duck. It had a crispy exterior and the meat was easily sliced as he ate.I am glad that we finally had a chance to dine at Dal Rae. I have passed this restaurant countless times during my childhood as well as during my adult life. There has always been a bit of a mystery about this place because I could never figure out what it was like inside. Dal Rae is a wonderful addition to the city of Pico Rivera because of its rich history and delicious menu selections!",0
2082,5712,Del Rae was a birthday wish dinner gone well. Thank you Enrique; your service was absolutely the best. You are an outstanding host. Thank you for making us feel so welcomed on my 50th birthday.,1
2083,5713,"*Technically a 3 1/2 star review*I didn't know about Dal Rae until this year's DineLA and my oh my, it's a mighty fine-looking establishment. I do think that unfortunately my DineLA experience didn't wow as I was hoping for but do think I'd love to come back for a second try.Food: Again, just to note I came for DineLA 2018 Winter. I got the bleu cheese wedge (was okay - still haven't had a super solid version of this), the pepper steak (a bit too peppery for my tastes and although I appreciated the toppings, thought it was a bit much), and the gold brick sundae (it looks amazing - but unfortunately taste-wise, didn't match up. Too sweet for my tastes and didn't line up flavor wise). Got a wine from the bar and they have a super solid list.You also get a bread basket and chilled veggie plate. It may not be as delicious as a few other steakhouses but definitely they give you a lot of options.Service: Our server was pretty good. It did seem like he was being a bit over-worked as he was seemingly running around to a LOT of tables. Maybe it was just a busy night.Decor: Definitely goes for that Chicago, darker-looking steakhouse vibe. Super classy (better to dress up than down here). My favorite area was the bar interestingly - fully stocked and looking good.Parking: There's valet parking for $4.50. Solid/pretty good.Again, all-in-all, I would love to come back and try a few different items and appreciated finding this classy steakhouse - just wasn't as wowed on my first try.",1
2084,5714,I love the vibe and everything I've ordered has been a home run. Usually order steak or fish which are exceptional but they also have the best chicken parm I've ever had.Drinks are great too!,0
2085,5715,"This place is absolutely amazing.  They are doing outdoor dining right! I applaud their efforts. We had a fabulous date night.  The food and abundance was top notch. Wait staff was 4 out of 5 but over all very good. They were quite busy and a bit slow to take  order and did not wrap up our food as I would expect in a steak house, but maybe its because of covid. Other the that it was perfect.  I highly recommend and we will be back.",1
2086,5716,I definitely recommend this place. Amazing food and drinks. Always a fun time here with our friends.,1
2087,5717,"I heard many great things about Dal Rae from my coworkers who participated in previous Dine L.A. so I knew I had to try it out for this year's Dine L.A.  Our reservation was at 8 PM on a Wednesday night, and the place was bustling.  You know it's a fancy schmancy place when the only option for parking is VALET.  Prices are a bit on the higher range, but let me tell you, Dal Rae freaking delivers.  There's a bar located inside the restaurant where you can grab a drink while you wait for the rest of your party.  For the $50 dinner for Dine L.A., you really get what you pay for:  great and attentive service, with high quality food.  It's definitely worth the value, and I can definitely see myself wanting to come back even when it's not for Dine L.A.|| L O C A T I O N / P A R K I N G ||-Corner of the Cross Streets are Washington & Rosemead Blvd behind Jack in the Box- $6 Valet parking ONLY.  Not sure if they take card, so make sure to have cash for this.|| S E R V I C E ||Our server definitely did beyond what was expected.  As we were seated, our bread basket, relish dish and waters were served immediately.  Once we told him that we were going with the Dine L.A. menu, he gave us his recommendations on what most people enjoyed from the menu, which I thought was extremely helpful as everything looked and sounded scrumptious.  He always came back to check up on us making sure nothing was ruining our dining experience.  Once it came to dessert,  which comes with complimentary tea and coffee, he actually brought out the whole tea chest so I could fully enjoy my tea experience.  || F O O D ||++Appetizer++Scallops - This came with (2) scallops, while on their regular appetizer menu, it comes with (4) scallops at $18.  Our server told us this was his favorite, so we decided to go for it, and I can see why he highly recommended this.  The scallops tasted fresh and was full of flavor, and the creamy sauce complimented it so well.  It's going to be difficult to share this appetizer with other people if I order this during my next visit.  It was a great start to our experience and by then, we couldn't wait to receive our main entrees.  ++Main Entree++[1] CHILEAN SEA BASS - Seeing that this was one of the popular dishes mentioned by fellow Yelpers, the bf did the sacrifice by letting me order my beloved steak, while he chose the Chilean Sea Bass so we could see what was the rave about.  Expectations were kept low; however, upon the first bite, we were blown away.  The cream sauce drizzled on top of the fish was rich and creamy, but not overbearingly heavy. It was a good thing that the sauce wasn't too rich, because the fish itself was pretty fatty.  It was like the sauce and the fish were one entity, as it meshed so well together.[2] PEPPERED FILET MIGNON - First impression was ""WOW, that's a huge filet mignon!"".  Seeing that this was a pretty fancy place, I was expecting the steak to be half of the size that it was, so I had indulged in my pretzels and cheese bread earlier.  It was my first time tasting a steak with so much flavor.  I'm not a fan of adding additional flavors to my steaks as I feel like if the steak is fresh, the natural juices of the steak would be enough for me.  I think I'm going to have to make an exception for Dal Rae.  Who knew pepper with chunks of bacon would make it an even better dish.  The peppered portion on top of the filet reminded me of one of my favorite chinese dishes: peppered salt pork chop.  Just imagine that pepper seasoning with bacon on top of a steak.  Yeah, it sounds so DIVINE, doesn't it?  Oh it is, and you bet I will be recommending this to my steak lover friends.  I asked for a medium rare steak and they pretty much delivered it as how I wanted it to be.  I'm drooling just thinking about how tasty it was.  ++Dessert++[1] CREME BRULEE - I'm a big fan of creme brulee, so I knew I had to choose this.  I was expecting a tiny portion like the size that you would get at Vegas buffets, but it was a good portion to share with at least 2 people. It was rich and creamy as I liked it to be.[2] N.Y. CHEESECAKE - This was personally average for me, but I'm just picky with my cheesecakes as I don't like it at room temperature.  The cheesecake was mixed with some zest which really wasn't my thing.",0
2088,5718,"We came to Dal Rae restaurant again last night. I actually brought my Mother as she was in town visiting and leaving on Saturday. I had recently told her about Dal Rae a little while back after our first time there.So since she was leaving we decided to go for a nice dinner for her last night here.All I can say is ""AMAZING"" !!! This restaurant is most definitely my top one now. The service, food, drinks and ambiance were just fantastic !!! The Ahi Tuna Tower was INCREDIBLE !!! So delicious, as was my Double Cut pork chop !!! I have NEVER had a pork chop SO GOOD AND PERFECTLY PREPARED. Kudos to the cooks and all involved in preparing this most wonderful wonderful dinner.My other most incredible compliment is to our AMAZING server Jennifer. In my 57 years of life I have NEVER gotten the kind of service we received from Jennifer, and no we do not know her. She was so very attentive, caring and her presentation of everything was great. I even asked the Mgr if we could request her on our next reservation, he said no problem. So yes I would highly recommend her as my waitress ALWAYS ! Thank you Jennifer for making our night just wonderful. I wish all servers cared like you do, it would be such a different experience for all.I also hope this review makes it not only to management but to all addressed in my review including Jennifer. Thank you Dal Rae for such an incredible evening !  If it was possible to give more than 5 stars I would have given 10 !!!",0
2089,5719,"We met some coworkers of my GF's there on Friday night. I had never heard of it ( don't know how after what I know now ), but my GF used to come a lot when she was younger and said it was always really good. Boy was she ever right ! All I can say is it was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME !!! The drinks, service, freshness and quality of food were just SPOT ON !!! We really enjoyed ourselves and had a fantastic time. I would absolutely rank this better than Northwoods Inn, and I really like Northwoods as well, but the food at Dal Rae was just BETTER !!!We will most definitely be a regular here. Many more visits to come.",1
2090,5720,"Very good restaurant!  I have only been here twice, but I like it very much.  The food and the service are excellent.  The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere, a bit dark for me.... a tiny bit more of lightning would have helped me to see the menu without the IPhone's light.  I will definitely go to this restaurant again!  A reservation is recommended since it gets really busy for dinner.",0
2091,5721,Tried this location for my birthday for the first time and unfortunately I will never return. First of all my food had a hair in it and instead of our waiter apologizing he seemed bother and waked away. Not one did he check on us and ask if we needed refills or how our food was. I really had high expectations since they came highly recommended but they did not meet our standards of good service.,0
2092,5722,"Been dining here over the years and have always had a great experience. Post COVID was horrible! Our server forgot our drinks then forgot our meals. When I contacted the manager, he went to the kitchen and our orders were served. My steak was cold! Not warm, I mean cold! The manager, I believe Mark, was a complete idiot.  You just lost 4 customers who use to drop serious money at this establishment.",0

2094,5724,"I don't where to start.. I being at this restaurant before for business meeting and lunch with ""business people"" and service was always great! Until I decided to take my parents to celebrate Father's Day.. WORST experience ever I will never come back and I will spread the word.. my reservation was 7pm, we got there 5 mins before. We got seated no problem, great job!! But no menus, no water,  no bread, no utensils, no tablecloth until 20/25mins later really? I understand all the regulations  with the corona virus but 20/25mins later? Idk Not ok then I call one of the boos boys so they can call our server, (she even had a person training) finally she got to our table..by the time we were eating dinner was 8:20pm it took more then an hour to get served. Ridiculous! During our dinning experience NO one came to our table to offer water or to ask how our meal.. like we didn't exist but 3 tables to the right west side woow Sever treated those people like queens why? Wondering why? Sorry my family don't look like businesses people and we are brown. I'm very disappointed about this experience and more then anything embraced with my parents, I told them we were gonna have a great experience bla bla bla and surprise! Thank you very much Dal Rey for the wonderful experience and treating us the way you did last night. Wondering why we have the movements and protests? No further discussion..",0

2099,5729,"Never heard of Dal Rae, but because of my love for good old fashion steak house's that serve only prime meat, my daughter bought us a gift card as a Christmas gift for Dal Rae.  The entire experience was awesome, well, except $6.00 charge to have your car parked.  Beautiful place inside, greeted at the door and taken directly to our table.  (It was fairly crowed, so I was happy reservations were made!)  Our waitress Haley was the best ever as she answer all of our questions and made some awesome suggestions.  We had Artichoke Hearts with crab and mushrooms for an appetizer which was out of this world!!  Next, Haley informed us that all there salads were large enough to split, which we did, and they were.  And now, for the reason we went...I ordered the bone in rib eye.  This piece of meat was one of the best tasting steaks I've ever had.  Coming from me, that is an incredible awesome statement and you can take that to the bank.  Our bill was $200 which included all our food, two cocktails and two glasses of wine and dessert.  If you think that's a lot of money, then you need to stay at Sizzler.  This is a Prime steak house and it is definitely worth the money!!!  We will be back!!",0
2100,5730,"HOLD ON FOLKS! You will be going BACK IN TIME! This isn't Back to the Future! It's not Hot Tub Time Machine! And it sure isn't the Avengers Endgame! No, this is Dal Rae Restaurant, where the decor is a throwback to the 1950s from the diner style sign outside to the old Vegas lounge style booth seating. So is it any surprise that the music playing in the background included Frank Sinatra?!We were here to celebrate a birthday so we chose a more upscale restaurant! While we waited for our order, they served a bread basket and raw vegetables on a small dish of ice.FRIED ZUCCHINI: These delicious morsels of deep fried and breaded zucchini were like a onion rings but with a soft and moist interior. The ranch dressing on the side was available for dipping.CREAM CORN AU GRATIN: It was a good tasting and firmly cooked corn kernels covered in a buttery rich white cream. An excellent accompaniment to our entrees!GARLIC MASH POTATOES: We were so full of carbs already from the bread and crispy fried zucchinis already! However, this soft creamy mash potatoes dish will melt in your mouth and provide a flavorful and filling addition to our multi-dish meal.CAESAR SALAD FOR 2:  The Caesar salad had a hint of tabassco sauce and was covered in some sort of pepper grains. The croutons were incredibly small cubes. The salad was firm and fresh and as someone in our party exclaimed ""this is the best Caesar salad I've had!!!""SHRIMP SCAMPI:  A well cooked shrimp scampi that had the potential to become a rubbery texture if overcooked. It was served with rice, with garlic, butter sauce and white wine.  Suffice to say, we finished this dish without any leftovers!CHILEAN SEABASS: This incredibly meaty and thick white fish is covered with a parmesan crust, sauteed onions, lemon butter. It was surrounded by thin slices of bell pepper and asparagus. The fish was well prepared, firm to eat, but moist and flavorful. It was clearly the best dish of the night!The service is FANTASTIC! When we ordered the Caesar salad, they wheeled out a mobile salad mixing station. The suited gentleman who prepared the salad invited the kids to help add the ingredients to the salad!  Our server was super cool too! At the end of the meal, she brought out a slice of chocolate cake with a lit candle for our birthday guest!  A great night at a great restaurant!",0

2102,5732,"Imagine, going back in time, and finding the hangout of Frank Sinatra, and the ""Rat Pack"", drinking and eating in a classy restaurant with all the booze and food keeps coming.  Well, you're not in the Twilight Zone, but instead, Pico Rivera, where a happening old school restaurant believes in customer service.  Mother's Day evening was our calling, and it was packed with no room except for the lounge.  We were told we'd have a good time, but we're really not drinkers...Starting our journey with a dish of a cold vegetable plate seemed old school enough, and we wondered how to eat this, or whether it was a decoration?  actually eating fresh vegetables before our meal was new to us, as fried foods and appetizers have slowly crept into our dietary supplement of food groups.  Next, came the bread and also cheese bread, which I was not expecting, but welcomed, as I was starving.  Now that I'm filled with fiber and flour, my main course (Chilean Sea Bass) comes out in all its glory, and tasted good, without any added condiments, except for lemon.  Not the freshest sea bass, but a large portion that filled me up.  With no more room inside me, we called it quits and started rounding up our doggy bags for a late evening snack, or breakfast.  All in all, a relatively high-class restaurant with nice service to boot.",1
2103,5733,"Ok my friends, I have been going to this wonderful restaurant and have always considered this one of my all time favorites for at least 35 years. Tonight has been an eye opener. Usually we make reservations but tonight I decided to wing it. In fact I'll sit in the bar and order. It wasn't great service but ok I understand. I'm in the bar I expected less. I always get the pepper steak and as usual I did again Cesar salad and drinks. I don't dress to the nines but I can say upper class. There was a table next to me of about ten Hispanic people tattoos completely covering their heads and arms. I'm not against that my son being military has his share of tattoos. I'm not opposed to sweats and hats but? Now they had children in the bar ok with that. From there we move on to food napkins etc on the floor now we move on to rug burns and boxing not to mention wrestling. Now we have the privilege of Mark our  mai-trie sitting down with them having a cocktail. When I pay two hundred and fifty dollars for a dinner eating in a bar that is not what I expect. When I got to the door I was angry. I told Mark he said "" oh I told them"" I said and then you ordered a drink and sat with them. He said "" I can't control them"" I said oh yes you can this is your space and that's all you have to control. What is going on? I knew this to be a wonderful place. The food good as usual. if I have to sit next to wrestling kids I will now find  another place to go have a nice dinner. So very sad that my favorite place has turned into a ""who cares kind of place .",1

This does not make for a nice dining experience.My husband and I usually order surf and turf and share. He ordered a steak of some sort with chimichuri toping. I had the sea bass. This had a lovely yummy crust and I enjoyed it very much. My husbands steak was picked at and not much was eaten. We've had the prime rib a few times and we should have stuck with this choice.

2113,5743,"Amazing food and nice ambiance.  Definitely a 5-star eatery!  We had the prime rib and bone-in rib eye steak which were cooked to perfection.  We also ordered the Caesar's salad that was prepared table side by one of the managers.  Had nice conversations with our server, Robert, and the manager who prepared our salad.  This is a restaurant that holds a high standard and hope it maintains it for years to come.Would love to bring our family and friends with us next time.",0
2114,5744,"WOW! Ryan and I celebrated our anniversary here and boy was it delicious.  We pulled out all the stops so lets get started:Baked Scallops (appetizer): baked with hollandaise sauce, parmesan cheese, and breadcrumbs.  Sounds super heavy but was not overwhelming or overly rich.  The scallops were soooooo tender and melt in your mouth delicious.  There are four in an order.Caesar Salad: Prepared tableside, this salad is the best salad I have ever had.  It's super garlicky and has nice even flavor of the parmesan cheese, anchovy, and lemon.  The croutons are so crispy crunchy that I didn't even reach for the garlic cheese bread that came with it, holy crap.Sometime in between our dramatically large pre-dinner food, our alcoholic beverages come out.  I ordered a Sidecar (a cognac cocktail with a sugar rim) and it was amazing.  You know you have a good drink where you taste all the good flavors of the alcohol enhanced with the add-ins (in this case refreshing lemon).My actual dinner was the Chilean Sea Bass (crusted with parmesan, yum) with a baked potato and asparagus.  Ryan got the sautéed mushrooms to split and everything was soooo good. The fish was perfectly cooked and the potato was buttery and smooth. The fish was a big ol' hunk of flaky magic. They really let the fish shine, it's not overly seasoned and it is just a delicious dish o' fish.I miss this meal.",0
2115,5745,"First time here and the food was delicious!!! My husband got the peppersteak and I got a ribeye, each with the garlic mash potatoes (suppppper delicious) served with crispy asparagus cooked to perfection!!! We will definitely be back! We're locals and never expected the food to be this good!!!",0
2116,5746,It's one of the oldest and best continental restaurants in Los Angeles.  It's best suited for a special occasion where the seafoods and meats are very good.,1
2117,5747,"Fantastic!!! Exceeded my expectations.  I ordered the prime-rib dinner for delivery to my house. I think it was the 16-ounce with bone.  Although the menu said prime rib and mashed potatoes, it also included perfectly cooked asparagus and a slice of red bell pepper.  Even though I have had several dinners at Lawry's Prime Rib in Beverly Hills, this prime rib was every bit as good, if not better. I look forward to ordering again.  Highly recommend. Door Dash delivered.",0
2118,5748,Not good when it comes to ordering your food for pickup. Was ignored by the staff the greeter was on the phone. Manager was getting people who came in after me. I asked when the food was going to be ready and he said he would check came back and instead of giving me an answer he was sitting people to their seats. First time here and not a very good first impression.,0

2121,5751,"** Valet: $6.00 **Celebrated a birthday here on a Saturday evening! Boy oh boy was I in absolute heaven. Indulging in calamari, bread, and a martini in the beginning, I was happy as a clam! I ordered the large Filet Mignon and was already thinking about the delicious leftovers I would have over the next couple of days. The baked potato? Also delicious. I tasted the mashed potatoes and those were amazing too. Tasted the veal and that was an interesting yet good experience too. The birthday boy had the Bone In steak and that is what i will be ordering if i ever go back to Del Rae's!We sat in the bar area where there was live music all evening but it was extremely  and uncomfortably loud making it difficult to have a conversation at all! That was a bummer!For dessert, we tried two different kinds of chocolate cake (one was flourless) and they both were delicious. I feel for this review the WORD OF THE DAY IS ""delicious""! You probably can't go wrong with anything you order at Del Rae's!One last thing I'd like to state is that they make the individual (or individuals) celebrating a birthday feel very special! The DJ sings and plays ""Happy Birthday"" which really gets the guests going participating and clapping along! That was pretty special and a nice thing to do for those celebrating.",0
2122,5752,"Went here for the Dine LA thing.This place reminds me of the golden Hollywood days of Los Angeles. It is very rear these days that bartenders actually wears tuxedos and services are personalized and catered to in a fine dining setting in my opinion. The level of service and ambiance is very, very intimate and quality driven.The food is generous in portion and well prepared and served promptly. For the Dine LA menu you get an appetizer, entree, and a dessert. Let me say this again, the portions are GENEROUS. The Dine LA menu only offers about half the size compared to regular dishes, and I still could not finish it. We got the oysters for appetizer(excellent), the wangyu steak and the filet mignon for entree. For dessert it was the cheese cake and the creme brulee.The only thing that was a little off was the wangyu. It was a little on the dry side. Both the filet and the wangyu had a lot of green onions on top of the meat to provide it with flavor, but in my opinion it actually makes the entree very pungent in taste and I was not used to it. Without the onions though, meat quality is excellent and well marbled. Try their wine pairing too, you will enjoy it.If you ever find yourself in Pico Rivera, look this place up.",0

2124,5754,"Went to have dinner with my mom and I was so excited until I witnessed how the service was. We called prior to make a reservation. As the host was seating us I got this very bad vibe that something bad was going to happen. The table was not set up, which was very wired since we did make a reservation. When the waitress arrived she brought us some water and never asked us if we wanted something else to drink. My mom had to ask for a glass of wine, after that she decided to change to a different type of wine and the waitress recommended a cheap wine. We ordered the Rockefeller oysters and the scallops as our appetizers. The oysters weren't clean and the scallops were ok.As the entree arrived we finally started eating. I asked the waitress if she could bring me some salt and pepper, the waitress arrived with a little plastic cup containing packages of salt and pepper. I wasn't expecting that since it looked like a nice high end restaurant. At the end of our main curse the waitress came to grab our plates and put on a tray as she left that tray behind me. Finally the waitress came and asked us if we wanted dessert. She brought us a slice of cake and it was pretty good. My mom was expecting the waitress to ask if we wanted anything else before she would bring us the check but she didn't so my mom had to ask her for a coffee.I wasn't expecting this type of service at this type of restaurant but after what I saw I don't think I would be going back to this restaurant. I was not impressed as I think this type of restaurant has the potentials to succeed and please their customers for what they are paying for.",1

I spoke with Kevin and he was very helpful and accommodating during these hard times (COVID). The staff was excellent and very friendly and was doing such an amazing job. The Pepper steak was delightful, such a great coupling with their potatoes and vegetables. The halibut was very good as well and very well proportioned.  That night just after and excellent dinner I proposed to my girlfriend and she said yes. Kevin and staff made sure to stop by the table and congratulate us and wish us well in our endeavors.",0
2126,5756,"Ideal mid century fine dining perfection. The Dal Rae is a magnificent survivor and a glamorous time machine to the best of the 1950s. Plus, the food is great! Classic Las Vegas style neon, valet parking, a lounge (with live music!) to wait in, then if you're lucky the owner will come prepare his incredible fresh Caesar salad tableside with great flourish. Then the meal begins. One of the most fabulous dining experiences in California.",1
2127,5757,"Had an outstanding meal here last Sunday night.  We were a party of 12 and we ate outdoors in a covered tent. We were plenty warm with the heaters, the food was delicious, the service was impeccable and we cannot wait to return. The interior of the restaurant is decorated very nicely for the holidays, but we really enjoyed eating outdoors because it was quieter. Thank you for making this a very special evening for me and my party.",0
2128,5758,"A hidden gem.  We are so used to eating trendy and fusion food that we forgot all about traditional, straight-forward, homestyle cooking.  I absolutely love the Christmas decor and how lively it is.B: Medallion filet mignon - usually not a fan at steakhouses even though beef is my preference.  It seems like the stew the meat because it is extra tender without the structure of a steakA+: Crab cakes - I love my MD blue crabs but these did it for me, so I will be back for this dishA: Scallops - super interesting, at first, I thought I was eating breaded scallops but turns out, it was egg yolk baked on top of the scallops that provided that textureA++: drinks, everything I expect in classic drinks, French 75 and Peach MartinisOverall, a great experience.  They have a piano bar (actually shaped like a piano) with live music and dancing.  I am looking forward to the next dinning experience here :)",0
2129,5759,"The Dal Rae is my favorite retro steak house in the greater LA area. If you want to pretend you and your friends are hanging out in the bar waiting for Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. to show up, the Dal Rae is the place to indulge your fantasy. It's dark, you can have an excellent martini and an excellent steak, cooked to order. Frank may not show up in person but his spirit is there, floating in over the speakers.And there is banana flambé, made at your table.I'd been to Dal Rae on a date and with friends on the weekends.  Service is always competent but weekends can be a bit rushed. My latest visit, this past Halloween, was my first visit on a weekday and what a pleasure it was.  I started out in the bar while waiting for my real life dining buddies; the barkeep suggested a pomegranate martini, which was the perfect fall cocktail to start the evening, its own kind of rich fruitiness (and maybe better if you don't think of it as a martini.) The bar appears well stocked and I followed up with a nice Pinot Noir to carry to my table. Once my friends arrived, the wonderful relish tray appeared (random thought: could the disappearance of the relish tray be the reason for the obesity epidemic? No one fills up on fresh green onions and celery and radishes before dinner any more.) Then, the bread basket and cheese toast and it was time for the main course. I've always ordered the petite pepper steak and find it to be the perfect size and wonderfully cooked. Rather than a potato I opted for a double order of asparagus.  Eileen took care of every detail with wit and humor and efficiency, making our experience all that much better.And then, of course, the pièce de résistance: banana flambé, a devilishly delicious and divinely prepared dessert. Bananas soaked with rum and set on fire at your table: best. ending. ever.Valet parking.",0
2130,5760,"Zero!!! Well I called prior to coming to this restaurant days before Friday reservation to ask if there's Vegetarian option and lady on phone says there's a menu not on website just asked our server named Derrick.

2131,5761,This is an old school steakhouse at it's finest. We came here for a special night with friends. Make a reservation because it's always busy.Food: The table side ceaser salad is definitely a must.  It was so delicious but definitely can be shared among 4 - 6 people. The steaks were absolutely phenomenal.  My husband had the peppercorn and I had a ribeye.Service: nothing lacking here.  We were treated with respect and had everything we needed all night.  Definitely would come back.,0
2132,5762,Came here on 3/24/21 for my mom's birthday. I chose this place because I felt it would be a great experience for her instead of other restaurants I was deciding on. I've been here couple of times before with no problems. Well I regretted it very much..pretty much since we first got there I wanted to leave and we should've because for the price it was not worth it!So we had reservations for 4:30 you would think they would be expecting guests around their reservation times but when we showed up not one person was seen and even valet was missing. We end up parking ourselves since parking is literally right there.. not sure why they even have valet ($6) ridiculous when parking is like 5 steps away smh. We get off the car and here comes valet saying to give the keys I said we're ok we already parked ourselves. He still wanted the keys because he wanted to turn our car the other way..ok whatever so gave the keys. Then we are in the front waiting and waiting (sign says to wait) Not one person to acknowledge us and it's super dark I thought they were closed or something.. I had to stop someone I saw inside and say we been waiting for awhile and noone has helped us.. she said server is probably in the back. Umm shouldn't there be a host?? Anyways we continue to wait and I'm growing frustrated.. then this man walks past us and goes inside to where there's a host desk and I guess he checks in. I'm like oh what the hell man.. i said we were here first and they just tell us to wait while ppl check in and the host not even acknowledging us till I said something to them! Then they decide to help us.. after we are already bothered by what's been going on and seated us late past our reservation! By now I had lost my appetite..for the first time ever I did not eat dinner at a restaurant on how bothered I was. So I decide to just get drunk calm me down.. well we ordered drinks and ALL of our drinks were watered down!! Like WTF these drinks are around $15-$18 each.. both the margaritas and the specialty cocktails were ALL watered down. I'm a bartender and that is not a proper drink! Then this guy server kept taking away stuff from our table like our appetizers without even asking if we were done with it like wtf.. he took it so fast too that I can't even say something to him! Just awful experience for a special day so disappointed .. My parents did like their food but didn't enjoy our outing :(. After 3 expensive cockatails I left sober! Smh Oh and because of COVID-19 there's a time limit and they still wanted to say we were still on time limit till I complained to the manager about them seating us late taking up our reservation time. He said it's ok to stay longer but we were ready to go they brought my mom a piece of cake for her birthday she said it was not good they gave her lemon cake.. like what made them think lemon was the best option smh..she always enjoys her cakes at restaurants so that was a fail too. Then we leave and valet wants us to pay him I said I'm not paying you we parked ourselves and our car is 5 steps away! He insisted I pay till I went back in and complained to the manager bout it and he had to tell them something. I don't think I'll ever go back!!,1

A must try indeed!",0
2135,5765,"So Dal Rae has been on our bucket list or some time and we decided to celebrate our 29th wedding anniversary here. It was the right choice and really can't remember when I've had such a great meal and lovely service with good portions. They take reservations through Open Table and I noticed a small sign at the hostess desk that said no weekend reservations at 6, 6:30 or 7PM. We received the complimentary relish tray, bread basket and warm cheese toast. I had the Medallions of fFlet Mignon with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes and my husband had the Dal Rae Famous New York Pepper Steak, asparagus and a baked potato. Our server, Robert, was super helpful and happy to talk about the menu. We ordered a great bottle of Simi Landslide cabernet for $55 and were given a free slice of cake to celebrate our special occasion. There were a couple of other tables celebrating birthdays as well. We were so happy with this meal and I am looking forward to bringing the family to celebrate our 30th next year.",0

2137,5767,"Dal Rae under normal (pre-Covid) conditions is a gem, but their adherence to safety under the current restrictions made us love them even more. My daughter and I dined inside their new outdoor tent recently, and the experience was exceptional. Although the restaurant was full, tables were spaced well so that diners didn't mix with other groups, and servers had adequate room to move about. The drinks, food, and service were their usual high quality, which made for a truly enjoyable evening. Best of all, we felt that Dal Rae was not only respectful of our Covid concerns, but also protective of their employees. We don't go out much these days, and Dal Rae made this outing truly enjoyable.",0
2138,5768,"Went for a birthday party (group of 8.I was really excited to try this place as it's close to home. I was told that it will be a bit pricey but good food by people who have been there before. Now, let me give you my input. Customer service was on point, they really make you feel welcome and accommodate all your needs. We ordered a Cesar salad for (2 people)  was $27 bucks, and a pepper steak for $58 to name a few. I really think  for what you get is really overpriced. If prices were a bit realistic maybe I'll be back more often but it's best to drive to Beverly Hills or Newport Beach (Javier's). Side note: i went to Las Vegas this weekend and i even found a steakhouse (Golden Steer) and had a better plate for way less. Sadly I don't see myself recommending or coming back but it was good experience!",0

2147,5777,"I think this place had its former glory but unfortunately there are so many better places if you're going to spend that kind of money.  The salads are sub-par, the outside of the building have seen better days.  The outside patio set up due to COVID was unpleasant to say the least for a restaurant that boasts this kind of ""fancy"" dining.  My father had called 2 weeks prior and requested for a corner booth which they acknowledged over the phone.  But when we got there, the receptionist lady took us outside in the parking lot set up.  Sadly my father was disappointed since we were celebrating their anniversary.  On a positive note their sea bass was delicious and came with a generous portion.  Hence the 2 stars.  The service was decent but not great.  If I were you, I would go elsewhere.  We're not coming back.",1
2148,5778,"Had the pleasure to have drinks and dinner at this place after many years of talking about it.Heard about this place thru someone I met while on work travel several years ago, and then again with the message being the sane, that this was an elegant place for an outstanding meal.  After perusing the website multiple times the evening finally arrived.  Stepping into this place is like stepping into your childhood, if you ever had the pleasure of going to a great steakhouse with your family for some monumental birthday, or one of those rich and sexy restaurants from a mob movie, where the drinks are strong and the service and food are amazing.  Yea that's absolutely the type of place.  Crooner music playing in the background, low level lighting, dark furnishings and the feeling of elegance.  I loved every moment of my experience here.When I go to a nice steakhouse I always order the filet mignon, so maybe I'm boring in that way, ignoring the options of tender fish.  It doesn't matter, I loved everything about my meal, the service, ambiance, wine selection, presentation, and I'm really looking forward to returning.  I was so impressed I returned the next day with a friend who was also on business travel (us both 400 miles from home) and she loved it and can't wait to return.  She had lunch at the bar.Enjoy your  time here.  The nostalgia is quite charming.",1

We happened to go during the dine LA menu which was reasonably priced at $49 a person. We each got an appetizer, entree and a desert. The service was great and the ambiance was nice and dark. But the food was just amazing! The steak tasted amazing and flavorful, one of the best I've had in a long time. The desert was also really good! I would definitely come back to try more items out. I would definitely say come dressed nicely and bring cash for the valet parking that is mandatory.",1

2155,5785,This place has a very cozy and upscale atmosphere. It was beautifully decorated for the season with beautiful holiday lights. I came here for a work party and the service was incredible even though it was extremely busy. The server was helpful answering questions and prompt with bringing out our dishes. We also ordered the baked brie and Caesar salads (not pictured) and let me just say YUM. My salmon was delicious and I also thoroughly enjoyed the bite I tried of my boss's chicken. I'd be interested to come back and try things from outside the holiday menu.,0

2158,5788,"Finally got to try the place out after wondering almost daily just commuting by and seeing full valet parking lot.Complimentary bread basket and butter and the pickled items, good stuff.  Loved the pickedl red round pepper thing.Started with the caesar salad tableside.  Only other place I had it was The Great Oak or something (steakhouse) inside of Pechanga, and loved it there.  Same authentic prep here and the results ended up being the highlight of the meal.  The individual flavors bursting in your mouth, definitely a 5 star.  Even at $24 for 2 servings, the taste makes it worth it.Went with the pepper steak prep on the bone in ribeye to try to get the best of both the pepper steak prep & the tastier/fattier ribeye.  Maybe should have stuck with the menu item filet or NY.  This ribeye was not fatty, it's like the prime rib type of flesh, not sure what the difference is but I remember buying a ""prime rib steak"" at Sam's club once and it turned out tasteless, vs. prime grade ""ribeye steak"" which always turns out great.  My guess is maybe a similar thing here, it tasted like bland flesh.  And my excitement for the renowned pepper topping/sauce was quickly extinguished upon tasting.  Also bland and just tasted like maybe some kind of a Chinese dish prep.  Main thing I believe is the lack of salt or flavor pop on neither the steak nor the sauce/toppings.  Taste maybe 3 stars, but for the high price 2 stars, not recommended.Maybe choosing the standard pepper steak filet or NY will yield a better result?  Tastier cut of meat but will still be a bland sauce/topping, I don't think it will be much better.Also got the lobster which is split and comes in 2 halves.  Not the big lobster tail type, but more the prawn looking lobster thing I guess.  And the flesh seems to get taken out and prepared with the cheese and mushrooms and sauce and put back in.  Flavor was ok, but can't really taste the lobster much in all the creamy sauce.  For the price, don't think it's worth it.Was kind of worried about service from all the reviews, but our server was Eileen and she was great, 5 stars.Overall, probably not worth trying again for my tastes.  Maybe I'm just hard on higher priced restaurants.  When paying high prices, I guess I expect flavors to really impress...Anyway, I don't have to wonder any more driving by, so that alone is worth it:)Oh, valet is $6",1
2159,5789,Went to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Made a reservation for 8:00PM we were seated at 8:45pm. The food was the biggest disappointment. We ordered the calamari which was flavorless and tasted like uncooked batter and the oil used to fry the calamari tasted old. We ordered the French onion soup which was the best part of the meal. We ordered the veal parmigiana which was bland and unseasoned. We had 2 drinks which were ok but pricey $18 a glass. For the price of the food it left you feeling robbed. It's terrible when you leave feeling swindled.,0
2160,5790,Great spot for a family meal or dinner and drinks with friends. I love their Chilean sea bass and the tuna sashimi on toast with avocado. There fairly  priced and quality of there food is pretty good.,0
2161,5791,"Bad service and indifference by staff/management.3 Problems:1. Reservation/Seating:I made reservations (see photo, proves it was made  24 hours in advance). It was never disclosed by staff that we were being seated in the smoking patio. People were not smoking when we were seated because it was being utilized as a dining area. However, once we started our meal, patrons started to come out for a smoke. Staff did nothing to request the smokers to cease from smoking or at least explain to us the situation. The front desk lady asked if we wanted a booth after we were well into our main course (1 hour later).2. Dessert Preparation:Requested the delicious bananas foster. Our server stated they could not prepare the dessert in the traditional way ""flambe table side"" because it was not possible to bring out the cart. However, they were able to do for the smoking group (their friends) just minutes later.  3. Management Reaction:After these incidents I decided to speak to management. Accommodations were not offered, not even a visit to our seating area to witness my claims. At the least offer a slight modification to bill (standard customer service). The manager vaguely apologized and stated this wouldn't happen next time. ""Next time""? I don't think so.As much as I love the food, I feel discriminated. Although my experience/food is consistently great, this time it was vastly different. I never asked for special treatment, just equal treatment. Our money is green and we are charged the same prices, correct?",0
2162,5792,"Went on a Thursday night. There was a dinner rush around 7:30 pm when we walked in but the place started to empty out around 9 pm. The service was quick and on it. Only valet available ($4.50). It's nice inside in an old fashioned way, very dimly lit.We had the calamari for an app. I had the sea bass alla ben with a baked potato side and tried the medium well filet mignon pepper steak with the rice pilaf side. The sea bass was good because of the crust and the sauce but it was slightly overcooked, I'd rather get the filet mignon pepper steak if I ever came back. The rice pilaf side had some kind of hard rice in the mix, it wasn't good. Stick with the other sides. I didn't bother with the bread after hearing it wasn't warm, the pickled vegetable platter was okay.My favorite parts of the meal were the calamari and medium well filet mignon pepper steak.I'd come back if I had to but I wouldn't choose to come here.",1
2163,5793,"This restaurant always has top quality food and service. Plus I love the ambiance inside the restaurant, feels like I'm in a mafia movie. My favorite thing on the menu is the sea bass. I should probably try something else but the fish is just SO GOOD. I wish I got a picture of my dessert last time, it was the best sundae I've ever had, and huge.",0
2164,5794,Went to dinner for three at 6:30pm and although it was very busy the service was 2hrs 45mins start to finish.  Extremely slow.  Rib Eye was tasty but room temperature.   Kinda disappointed but will go back.  The restaurant does need an excellent sound system and better dinner music.  It was very boring.,0
2165,5795,"I can't give this place 5 stars, but place it solid 4+ territory.  I most recently came for lunch.  Been here 3x for lunch now.  It's very nice, no doubt.  Service is solid too.  I just don't see anything really special about the food that warrants 5 stars, especially for lunch.  It's really good, but not exceptional.  I'm sure the Friday night/Saturday night crowd may disagree, as the cocktail lounge area looks really inviting, and I suspect dinner is likely better than lunch.  Overall this place is solid.  Also they have a room that is perfect for about 25-30 folks for a fancy lunch team meeting.",0
2166,5796,Amazing I love it good place to eat one of my go tos for special occasions I highly recommend tou try this hoax's if you haven't already it's priced very fair and has beautiful old feel lounge like setting dress code is upscale casual,1
2167,5797,"Unbelievable service! I haven't enjoyed a restaurant like this maybe ever. A big thank you to the staff. This was a last minute decision on a Friday night. I came and there was no wait, we had to sit outside but we were okay with just being able to have a table. I will definitely come back with a reservation to be able to sit inside because it looked very nice and I loved the ambiance. It's pricey, but my dish was absolutely delicious it was worth every penny. If it weren't for the price I would actual be a regular, but it makes it a special treat for when I do decide to come back. Our waiter Manuel was awesome. The hostesses were also very nice. Great job to the employees it made our experience extremely enjoyable with your kindness and good attitudes.",0
2168,5798,"What a gorgeous and glamorous place during the holiday season!! The decor alone is so beautiful you want to take pictures in every part of the dining room. I attended on a Friday night and there was a live DJ who sang some Christmas tunes. He was awesome! The service was perfect. Our waitress was attentive, helpful and kind. I believe her name was Christy. The wine menu is extensive but the bottle and the glass which I love. The dinner menu is Meat (esp. Steak) Heavy as it is a Steakhouse. I had the Crab mushrooms for an appetizer then the Ribeye for dinner. My date had the New York Strip and we both agreed the Ribeye was way tastier.This place isn't just food for a date night but also with friends. Opposite the dining room there is a full bar area that is very spacious.Also great for family dinners with kids! But kindly go earlier with little ones (no shade) lol.***Valet is the only parking option if you use the restaurants parking lot. $6 + tip.***HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",0
2169,5799,Don't judge a book by its cover or its name. Excellent high class restaurant and dinner.  You will not be disappointed.,1
2170,5800,"When going out to a restaurant was an adventure. This place harkins back to my childhood when we would get dressed up and go to a really fancy place for dinner. In this regard the Dal Rae does not disappoint. Comfy booth for a party of six, my mother-in-law's 85th birthday lunch. From the valet parking to the scrumptious appetizers to the festive decor to the impeccable service to the delicious food and finally all the deserts we shared it was a memorable afternoon. I don't remember the last time I took over 2 hours for lunch.",1
2171,5801,"Short Review:If you love the nostalgia of the 1950's you'll love this place. Great staff who actually wants to know you, awesome food - try the hand-made table side caesar!Long Review:I imagine that back in the 1950's and 1960's this place rivaled the Cabana Club. I don't know that for sure, but there is so much good energy and excitement inside! When you walk in, you're immediately greeted by one of the hostesses. Beyond them is a large, welcoming U-shaped bar with additional table  seating area in the room. The cocktail menu is better than the wine list, and they make every kind of martini you can think of. (I enjoyed the cucumber martini more than the lemon drop...but who's counting drinks??!!)The dining room is always packed and like a mob boss, you have your choice of perimeter booth seating. They're known for their tableside caesar salad, which the maitre d hand makes right in front of you - including the dressing! Yummy! They also have a great selection of steaks and seafood. I had the bone-in rib eye which was prepared perfectly and amazingly good. For dessert, they also do a tableside bananas flamboyee that is absolutely the best dessert on the menu.If you're looking for a fun night out with friends or a romantic dinner for two, this is a great place to go for a night out. High recommend.",0
2172,5802,Ordered takeout a few days ago and had a wonderful experience. Food was ready on time and the flavors were DELICIOUS . The staff is doing their absolute best during theSe crazy times and I cannot recommend this restaurant more,0
2173,5803,"On March 27 we headed to Dal Rae for our very first time! We were really looking forward to it until we met our greeter.  When we arrived we said hello to an older white woman and informed her we had a reservation.  She just looked at us up and down and with a really snarky tone said ""okkkkkkk.""  Ummm, ok what? Even my Husband noticed and gave me a look like ""what's up with her?"" She then asked for our name and walked us outside; it was an Instant mood changer. One of the other people who worked there must have noticed and asked if I was ok.  I told him what happened and he proceeded to inform me that customers have made complaints about her in the past. The food was good, the drinks were ok, but I don't think I'll be returning to this restaurant anytime soon.  That lady needs a lesson in customer service.",0
2174,5804,"A bit disappointing.   Service was 5 star.   Our server was fantastic.  Food was 2 stars and mediocre at best.   Escargots -lukewarm and under heated - the garlic was very raw.  Ahi tower was actually ok.   Entrees: prime rib was chewy and not pleasant to eat.  Beef stroganoff was plain weird with a heavy dose of bacon.   We should have returned both.   New York steak was fine but nothing special.  Filet with pepper corn sauce was good - but not great.   Chocolate delight cake (?) was just plain tired.    We have patronized Dal Rae on many occasions. always consistent.  Except for last night.   Surprisingly, not that busy for a Saturday.  The dining room did not seem understaffed and will say that service was excellent and attentive.I think that COVID has become an excuse to charge high prices and deliver mediocrity.   $48 for a steak should deliver some sort of gustatory pleasure.   Too many dishes poorly executed with a dining room far from capacity makes me wonder what's happening on the line.    Perhaps the dizzying array of menu choice need to be pared down.    Was hoping for a special evening.  What I got instead was an over-priced pedestrian experience.",0
2175,5805,"I brought my Mother in Law for a special lunch this afternoon. We were immediately greeted with a genuine smile from a lovely blonde woman, (wish I asked for her name). In my reservation I put it was a special occasion for my MIL and the woman greeted her with ""this must be your beautiful Mother in Law""! Mom's eyes lit up and she felt so special. It's little touches like this that go along way.We were seated at a very comfortable booth and were offered drinks and bread right away. Our Server Michelle ""AKA"" M&M was on point and personable. We shared a shrimp cocktail which was perfectly made, an artichoke and some of the best king crab legs I've ever had.Thank you to the entire staff, including the valet for making our special lunch that much better. See you soon M&M!Amanda",0

2178,5808,"First timer here! Small, but mighty place to dine! Be prepared to pay $6 for valet as the parking is a bit small. Food was delicious and the service was exceptional!!!We came with a large work group and had the Ceaser Salad, Oysters Rockefeller, Escargot, Peppercorn Steak, Chilean Sea Bass, Filet Medallions in mushroom cream sauce, and the Pork Chops. Desserts were Raspberry Sherbet and Creme Brûlée.Everything was delicious and the ""low lighting"" people are crying about in other reviews is not even an issue...",0
2179,5809,"My boyfriend has been raving about this place for months as the best filet mignon ever. We live an hour away, hence couldn't just up and go there for dinner any day.We finally made it there on a special occasion and boy oh boy, definitely one of the best steaks I've ever had.Atmosphere comes from the guests, their conversations, the clinking of glasses and cutlery. Its a very relaxed environment in a romantic setting.Service by Robert our waiter was on point. Food arrived stat. Donno how they do it that fast without compromising on quality. Very very efficient and attentive service.Yes their Filet mignon was moist and juicy and perfectly pink, i'm not surprised, they are known for that. What blew me away is the perfectly crispy asparagus and a very flavorful side of pilaf. Creme bruule for dessert had real vanilla bean. That in my books is an A+Looking forward to going there for yet another special occasion!",0
2180,5810,"Best in the OC for nostalgic atmosphere, excellent service and probably the best food ever! This is a must visit place.",1
2181,5811,Amazing!! The ambience! The food! The service! No complaints at all! I've been coming here since I was kid with my family and it's always a wonderful night!,1
2182,5812,My husband took me here for a special bday dinner. Everything was perfect. They make the BEST dirty martinis here. And the food is amazing. My filet mignon was cooked perfect and my wedge salad was so crisp and flavorful. Our server which i can remember her name was so professional and sweet. I cant wait to come back worth every penny.,0
2183,5813,"I had been coming here for more than 20 years. Every visit the food, drinks and service consistently blow my mind. They always participate in Dine La. The valet parking is a plus. Althought the pepper steak is their signature dish, I always order Chelian Seabass. Melt in your mouth. A great place to celebrate anything or just a date night. Before COVID they have piano player that entertain the customer.",0
2184,5814,even during a nuclear fallout it would still be excellent.pepper filet steak  is the bomb!,1
2185,5815,The Dal Rae was a very nice location spot for my friends birthday dinner. We sat in the back room and had a great spot where we could still hear the live entertainment. I ordered the prime rib with mashed potatoes and the bf ordered the peppered filet mignon. Both pieces of meat were good sized and were cooked to perfection!I knocked off one star since the prices are on the higher end and I probably won't come back to this location unless it's for a special occasion.,1
2186,5816,"I enjoyed my dining experience here. The ambiance, service, and the food was good. The servers were very attentive and knowledgeable. The managers were very accommodating and going around tables asking if everything was okay and I really appreciated the gesture.We ordered shrimp cocktail appetizer, clam chowder,  prime rib and The Sea bass. The sea bass was buttery and fresh; you can never go wrong with prime rib. For dessert, We ordered creme brûlée, banana flambé, and got a complimentary chocolate cake because we were celebrating an event.Overall, my experience was very pleasant.",0
2187,5817,I usually have to go to LA to find a nice upscale restaurant but I'm glad my friends brought me here and the food is so delicious. We always make reservations before coming so I wouldn't come without one.My favorite plate is the chicken Monterey and the shrimp cocktails! The shrimps are hugeeee. Drinks are reasonable and let's me honest it's not cheap here. You get a singer on weekends & professional staff. There's a lemon cake that I forget what's it called because by that time I'm  on my 4th vodka soda.Great spot for birthday dinners/ date/ or simply have a great fine dining experience,0
2188,5818,Simply the best. One of my favorites in L.A. Never had better than their Ceasar Salad in all L.A. Coffee is so rich and tastes like coffee!!! Simply the best!!,1
2189,5819,"Went here today for happy hour. Read all the reviews and thought I had finally found a place not too far from home that would have good food. The staff was very nice and attentive when we arrived and our server asked if we were craving anything. I was: I wanted meatballs. So, I settled on spaghetti and meatballs, but with angel hair pasta, a french onion soup, and my partner had the chicken tortilla soup alongside the steak french fries.He said his food was ""fine;"" not good, but ""fine."" Myself, the pasta was overcooked and soggy, the meatballs tasted like sausage and were incredibly chewy - I wonder if they might have been frozen. The marinara tasted ""fine"" but was so watery that it ran through all of the noodles. I was given a side of what looked and tasted like Kraft parmesan, which I didn't add to my entree. The onion soup was essentially a small bowl of croutons with a little cheese and a little soup. Not much onion and not much flavor.The total bill came to $50. If you park here there is only valet parking, which is either $4.50 for lunch or $6 for dinner. For what we spent, I was expecting more. I was disappointed in my meal and still have a craving for proper meatballs.",0
2190,5820,"I would have left a 5 star review but I didn't appreciate all the rules. Can't sit (and buy cocktails) unless your entire party is there, reminded immediately about the time limit verbally and literally highlighted on our menu, only 3 menus allowed maximum per table, a slip of ""rules"" left on our table telling us to wear our mask when seated and ordering, etc. Didn't feel 5 star and not what we came for. Valets, server and staff other than the hostess are all friendly and welcoming. Food is excellent. We've been eating here for many years but haven't been here since the last time they were open for patio dining and won't be back anytime soon. Not as relaxing as other high end restaurants we frequent.",1
2191,5821,"The table side Cesar Salad is delicious. We come here when we crave great service and great food. The steak Diane is a better choice, but the Châteaubriand is a close second. Their pepper steak and lobster Thermidor are amazing. The classics are awesome. We have our family dinners here for all events. And the food is perfectly hot. They have live music in the bar and their cocktails are very well served. A beautiful gem with valet parking and yes the bar and restaurant do get busy on Friday and Saturday nights.",0
2192,5822,Dal Rae is like a time capsule of an old school steak house. Its a charming little place near Pico Rivera. I came here as a recommendation from co-workers. Its a wonderful charming little restaurant different then your CUTS / Mortons / Ruth Chris.The servers here are wonderful. They keep your drinks filled and talk to you describing what they have. My wife and I enjoyed our visit here.The food:Pepper steak: It is a steak with a bunch of garlic and onions all over it. It really intensifies the flavor. Wow it was moist and cooked to absolute perfection. It comes with mashed potatoes (mix it with the pepper steak absolute heaven)Overall great meal and experience!,0
2193,5823,"This is the place where the old school, well-heeled geriatric crowd from Whittier and Pico Rivera come to dine.  You can tell immediately when you pull in to valet (no self parking in this classy joint) and you see the line of Benzes, Cadillacs, Range Rovers.  This food has been hit and miss.  The prime rib lunch special is a great value for $22.  However, the last time I was there, it was not on the lunch special menu.  So I tried the sole with lemon capers lunch special.  Unfortunately, it did not taste fresh.If ever I witnessed a successful restaurant, this place is it.  The place is constantly packed every time I visit.  They must be doing something right.",1
2194,5824,Hidden gem of upscale dining in Pico Rivera area! Had one of the best swordfish I ever had from here.  My friend who ordered a steak was also impressed. The outdoor dining area had a nice feel to it but sad that it's not probably available currently.  Can't wait to come back again,1
2195,5825,"service was bad, we were a party of 12 and our server couldn't even go around the whole table when asking for drinks/appetizers. worst bday dinner ever lmao.",0
2196,5826,"While staying in Orange County for a few days, our friends who live in Downey invited us here for lunch on a Friday.  One of our friends, who is just a meat and potato guy, said this is one of his favorite restaurants.  Our friends enjoyed their fillet mignon and sea bass.   I had seared tuna salad which looked beautiful to look at.   The tuna was fresh and delicious but the seaweed salad was fishy.  My husband had Greek salad with lamb tenderloin.  He said it was okay. Good green tea. Top notch service.  Overall, we enjoyed the dining experience.",1
2197,5827,Delicious food.  Amazing service.  Came here to celebrate my husband's birthday with friends. The restaurant doesn't look fancy from the outside but you can tell how classy the clientele are from the expensive cars that are valet parked outside.Inside the decor is a 70s vibe. The main dining area is dimly lit but there is a garden area that is brighter.  Place is noisy but a good noise- one filled with cheerful conversation and laughter.  There is usually music in the background and/or someone playing the piano.  Our party ordered Chilean Sea Bass Ala Ben ( highly recommend) & the lamb along with salads for appetizers.  The portions are large! Our party shared the salads and still had enough to take home.  There are a variety of food options from seafood to chicken to steak- all very good.  They also have an extensive wine and cocktail menu.This is great place to splurge for a nice evening out.  Expect to spend some money but it will worth it!,0
2198,5828,Raved about this place to a group. Unfortunately all of our steaks were overcooked. Ordered medium rare filets and New York strips. They came out medium-well and super dry. Received two free desserts for the mishap. Used to really like this place.,1
2199,5829,"I threw up. it's my fiancé's birthday tonight and i had reserved Dal Rae for us to enjoy a romantic dinner, instead i threw up. we had the seafood platter appetizer, the only edible thing in the plate was the oysters. highly recommend the chef's crack open their snow crab claw and try not to barf. same with their lobster tail that looked discolored and ultimately was the nail in my coffin. i didn't want to ruin my fiancé's dinner so i kept pushing. we also tried the POMEGRANATE martini that was strong i couldn't drink it ( i like to drink everything). we canceled our entree's because i was going to vomit but we had to wait for the manager to come see us and charge us for the appetizer which took 15 minutes. to make matters worse as i was attempting to tell the manager politely how i felt nauseous, he asked if i was ""ALLERGIC TO SEAFOOD"" ????? never recommending this business. too bad too! i heard they were once very established.",1
2200,5830,"So we came to Dal Rae for lunch and I could tell when we entered, we should come for dinner and not lunch.  Needless to say, after seeing the inside and the menu, I was right.  Old school formality here that is meant for dinner not lunch as the lunch menu does not have the steaks we were craving.We ended up having the fish special and the filet sandwich with a salad.The fish was fine, however the filet sandwich was a complete waste of money.  The sandwich was put together like a child and it fell apart like mad and there was very little meat.  I counted three small pieces on each half of the sandwich.  There was much more bread then filet.  It should have been named, Bread sandwich with a side of filet.  Also, it was tasteless.  No seasoning at any level.The service was fine and the only thiing that really saved this from being a one star review was the desert.  It was awesome!  I had the chocolate cake with chocolate Ice Cream.  Soooooo good!!  The cake was cool and fresh and the Ice Cream was creamy and not icy.  I just wish the entire meal could have been that way.",0
2201,5831,"Yelp said it best. ""Meh. I've experienced better.""I came in on a Friday night for a surprise engagement dinner. After driving over an hour in traffic to come straight after work, I noticed that I was actually about 20-30 minutes early. I drove into the parking lot until I noticed a man running next to my car trying to flag me down. Apparently this restaurant is valet only despite there being a plethora of parking. I asked if I could just park the car myself since I wanted to wait in the car a bit and I had a few decorations and supplies I didn't want to just carry in myself.The valet seemed super confused. And just proceeded to tell me I'd have to pay anyways so it'd be my choice. Uh.... okay. After a while I finally walked in and the same guy chased after me to give me a valet ticket asking if I could pay right now. I found the whole ordeal kind of rude and insulting.After finally sitting down for dinner I immediately noticed how long it took to order and get our food. For a meal that took about 3 hours I would expect the food to be better. As the night progressed there was a strange karaoke situation happening in the room next to us. All i could hear was a knock off version of a Bruno Mars wannabe singing full force for the last hour of our meal. His singing and the whole meal was not 24K magic to say the least...I don't want to ramble on so I'll end my review saying please please skip this place.Food is average. Service is slow. Waiters were rude. Do yourself a favor a go somewhere else... anywhere else. After waiting an additional 20 minutes to get the bill handled ... I literally ran out of the restaurant because for a moment there I thought this was my life and I'd somehow be stuck in Dal Rae restaurant forever... ah scary thought.",0
2202,5832,Awesome place. Food is great and the ambience is solid. Although my friend Pete disagrees. He is not to be believed,1
2203,5833,"Great dining experience. We all enjoyed the lunch prime rib on Thursday, and I'd love to be able to come back and try this place again for a dinner sometime.",0
2204,5834,Never fails at succeeding and satisfying patrons taste buds!!! The best dessert is the crème brûlée !!!,1
2205,5835,What ever I say about this place.. this place from how many people come in.. will have no problems making money...I dont have a standard to compare this place since I've never been to a steak house before.. but I'm assuming all places like this place is expensive..So basically it's a very dark moody atmosphere .. where we and I noticed several others used there phones for a light source to read the menu..I had the salmon - Alaskan wild caught..My wife had a steak.. my opinion is the food is cooked to perfection and then lightly season.. hoping to bring the flavor the meat more.. I personally like a lot more seasoning personally but my wife liked her dish very much.. but i believe it's due in the sides that the meat gets complimented on... so you ha e to see it as a whole.. unfortunately I had veggies with mine.. so it tasted a little more bland and found myself reaching for butter often..But it's a happening place.. I'm sure theres a reason for that.. make an appt so you make sure you get seated..,1
2206,5836,"I took my beautiful wife to the Dal Rae last night. There are no pictures because we decided to just be in the moment like the old days. It was our first time there and we have to say that it was every bit as good as everybody says. Food was excellent. Service was great. I will just give one warning for those who have never been there. Don't eat the food they bring out at first. It's a trap! I still can't figure out their desired end result, but there are definitely some diabolical machinations going on. They continue with the cheese bread but that part is worth it. Just ask them to only bring out two pieces and hold them to it (like that scene in Young Frankenstein). I will start saving my shekels for another visit, but we will go in much wiser next time (and properly trained and prepared). I skipped lunch to enjoy the dinner and went it too hungry. Lesson learned. At least I was wise enough to avoid the appetizers (which all sounded amazing). Can't wait to go back.",0
2207,5837,"Prime Rib Everyday!Really enjoyed the service here, the atmosphere is lovely too, it made you wonder "" Am I in Pico Rivera"" ? Very classic 1990s vibe.  Had the thick cut prime rib, make sure to come in hungry!  Very big, thick sliced juicy prime rib cooked to your liking. Also had some side dishes which did not disappoint.A great spot for every single occasions.",0
2208,5838,"Dal Rae Restaurant has been around for years. I remember coming here as a kid for fancy family events. It's still pitch dark in the joint and I think that's part of their charm. The seats are nice and super close to each other. It gives you that nice crammed feeling.The wait staff is first rate! They answer all your questions and are very polite. On my most recent two visits I ordered the prime rib both times. It was EXCELLENT. The food here is pretty darn good. Good enough to keep warranting return visits for birthdays and other celebrations.We even took the kids and it wasn't a big deal. We showed up at 4:45pm and were waiting outside. Like a fine tuned watch at 5:00pm TONS of people showed up. Like, holy crap, this horde of people showed up all at once. It was crazy.We sat a large party and were waited on in style. We ordered prime rib, Lobster tail, spaghetti, and of course desert.On the subject of desert please stop destroying the Tiramisu with that raspberry drizzle. Seriously, please, just stop. People reading this go ahead and Google Image search: Tiramisu. See how 100% of those look? Yeah.  That's how Tiramisu is supposed to look AND taste. The zig-zag lines of sickeningly sweet raspberry sauce completely ruin this DELECACY of Italian perfection. Tiramisu NEVER needs to be elevated; ever. It's a flawless desert all on its own.Aside from the butchering of my beloved desert everything here is wonderful. The food is good, the people are nice, and the atmosphere is all dark and mysterious.",0
2209,5839,Saturday we ate at Dal Rae's for dinner.  Had only been there once before.  Simply a pleasure to be there and the food is great.,1

I just got hit with another restaurant that I never heard of, but many people have come down to dine in class. Plus, I really never thought it would be here. Maybe many years ago, this was the place. My wife and I take our mother-in-law and niece to dinner at the fancy, Dal Rae Restaurant in Pico Rivera.Located on the Northeast corner of Rosemead Blvd/Washington Blvd., you will find a building that looks like it belongs from the Rat Pack Era. Hopefully, you know who they are. Better yet, envision when Las Vegas started. From the outside, Dal Rae feels out of place with the real world. When you walk right in, you never knew you are still in Pico Rivera. Dal Rae has Valet Service Only as for a place of this integrity deserves. My wife and I saw other people parking next door or across the street. Please beware that your vehicle can be towed. They Valets are there ready to park your vehicle and you can walk down the carpet into the restaurant.Glad we had reservations for Mother's Day as there was a lot of people on standby for a table.The Dal Rae Hostess walked us down to our booth in a heavily dark room. It was dark in there, but I can see the reason for intimacy with family. It was a big dining hall with some retro style booths. I would see a lot of history in here with mafia deals to public figures dining here from time to time. The Dal Rae Staff brought us complimentary bread of various types with butter as well as chilled vegetables on ice with radishes, celery, and, carrots.We looked through the menu offerings and every one was as delicious as you go through the menu. If you have a child or children with you, Dal Rae does offer Kid's Entrees ranging from the classic spaghetti ($8.95) to a cheeseburger ($8.95). For the adults, you can start with the wine and the fresh seafood that can compliment so well with it. You can order some Fresh Oysters to Crab Cakes. My wife and I were hungry and eager to eat on Dal Rae's food. Sorry, I don't have drink prices, but they are fairly reasonable.My wife ordered the Halibut which is not on the menu and will be offered on different days. I ordered the Duck à l' Orange ($32) with a Baked Potato. You can have French Fries, Vegetables, Mashed Potatoes, or Rice Pilaf as well. Our Niece ordered the Spaghetti ($8.95) and our mother-in-law ordered the Filet Mignon ($36). The wait for our meal would be about 20 minutes due to the filled capacity of Dal Rae. When the food came, we were dining like we in the classic times, but with phones that takes pictures. My wife had the flash on and made the room bright up. Then again, it was Mother's Day and flashes were going left and right for photo-ops.My Duck à l' Orange was beautiful. I haven't had duck in awhile, but this would be the spot to try it. Duck à l' Orange had a crisp skin with a sauce a nice sauce with Rice Pilaf. If more stores served duck, I would be eating it more often. Every piece of the duck slid right off and the pieces that didn't well, it was going to be eaten anyways. The Rice Pilaf served the dish very well with the duck. Don't forget your side dish of a Baked Potato. So Good!! Our niece doesn't understand why I love duck, but I DO! Dal Rae definitely made this dish to perfection!As much as I was surprised about Dal Rae's food, I was still surprised that it was there hiding in Pico Rivera. No one really talks about it and I have heard of restaurants that opened recently and gathering big crowds, but Dal Rae has been here for awhile. That's why you may drive passed a building many time to only find out that business has history in the area. Dale Rae is more than a special occasion type, it is an experience to try.Your Yelp Story is not just a review for some, but a story for many. You write today and share a future for tomorrow.

2211,5841,"This was our first time to come here and also to celebrated my friend's birthday. The service is average, but the food are delicious. To compared other steak house restaurants around SGV, this is the best we find in here.Highly recommend the steak and the sea bass. Will definitely come back in future.",0
2212,5842,Excellent!!! Dal Rae is on of my favorite restaurant the food is Excellent and so is the service I can't say anything bad about Dal Rae I love the food and the vibe,1
2213,5843,I've  been there a couple of times. And every time I go I always order the Chilean Seabass. I've  been there for work related and family time. I always try whatever my family orders. The Seabass never disappoints. Very nice ambiance.  This is a fabulous restaurant for Pico Rivera!,0
2214,5844,"Delicious! There is nothing else to say that describes this restaurant. Everything on the menu is prepared to order and you can taste the quality. New safety and health measures are in place while dinning due to COVID. The only aspect that should be reconsidered is the valet only option, I really don't want anyone breathing and touching my steering wheel right now. I took matters into my own hands and sanitized my car but did feel slightly uncomfortable. We ordered the oysters Rockefeller, calamari, Cesar salad, Chilean sea bass, filet mignon, Chivas, cucumber martini, espresso martini and creme brûlée's for dessert. Price for 2 was around $400 but well worth it!",0
2215,5845,Ok I was not expecting this. We came to this place on a suggestion of a good friend who has been a restauranteur for over 40 years. When I pulled up I was a little uncertain. Inside it reminds me of a 1960 decor. The magic happen when my wife ordered the pepper steak sea bass combo. I have spent far far more on a meal of much less standing. Then my meal was a bone in that melted like butter in my mouth. The food is incredible. I can not begin to say how incredibly surprised I am. A must try,0
2216,5846,"Came here on a monday afternoon and foolishly ignored the red flag of a completely empty restaurant. Two of the waitresses were very nice but the one male waiter who brought us our food left it on the portable side table and didnt even place our plates on the table. The tid bits were okay, the calamari was sopping wet, but the oysters. The oysters were for sure the worst ive ever had in my  life. I consider myself an oyster connoisseur and the ones here were absolutely inedible. We cancelled the rest of our order and left to go eat somewhere else.",0
2217,5847,"I've been to the Dal Rae multiple times now on my visits to the west coast over the years and if there is any one constant on all my journey's, this place is it with its great atmosphere and food.Everything about the restaurant, from the sign outside to the bar inside screams old school classy. I feel like I'm being transported into a scene from either the movie Swingers or Goodfellas when I walk in, almost expecting someone from the rat pack hanging out. Every single person on staff is friendly and helpful, and the location is big enough inside to have private parties (we had one in the enclosed patio area outside near the entrance - cool spot). They also have a nice piano in the corner where they occasionally have live and really good entertainment.On my recent visit, I ordered the Prime Wagyu Flat Iron Steak. An 8oz American Kobe Steak that was accompanied by a side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. I can easily say, this was one of the best kobe steaks I've had. Perfectly seasoned and cooked to absolute perfection. I usually don't like repeating orders, but next time I visit I will be ordering this again!",0
2218,5848,"The best Cesar's salad for two I've ever had anywhere. Tomahawk steak cook to perfection. Would love for them to add golden road ipa. Goose island is ok. Garlic mashed potatoes very good. Crispy thin onion rings very good. Cheese toast very good. Best steakhouse I've been to.... which includes...Frank and Russo's, steaks are as good but all the sides suckMorton's, steaks average, Mac n cheese reheated frozen in the middle, embarrassing.The Stinking rose, excellent but, Rae's is still better.To name a few...",0

Crispy thin onion rings very good. Cheese toast very good. As good is not better than any steak joint I've been to.,1
2220,5850,I Love this place. Best lamb chops ever. Nice atmosphere. Bananas Foster a MUST for desert or anytime for sure. I can't wait to go back. I've been going here for years. Thank you. Del Rae,1
2221,5851,Dickie and I have been several times over the years and it never disappoints. Amazing service and food. Cheers to all the servers and management who make us always feel so special!,1
2222,5852,"We arrived 10 minutes early for our reservation, they seated us 10 minutes late, speaking of seating , they should remove about half their tables, we couldn't walk across the room without rubbing our butts on the back of people's heads.. The atmosphere is awesome! The food is amazing, the food takes FOREVER to come.. I WOULD highly recommend this place to anyone with time on their hands.. I will most likely go back..",0
2223,5853,"This Restaurant is very fancy but I was very disappointed  on the plate I ordered.  Okay so I'm pretty fed up with lobster and crab legs so I decided to order the steak  sandwich.Seeing the steak sandwich is $38.50 I was visualizing something spectacular.I couldn't be so wrong.  Don't get me wrong the steak is very tasteful but the fact of the matter is it's not a sandwich!! It's called open faced which by the way does not mention anything on the menu of being open faced and it's basically a steak on top of one bread with some onion rings on top!  Did anyone think this through?I could of paid $10 at Jim's Burgers or Golden Ox and had a really good steak sandwich with two breads,mayo and even lettuce.  Never again! Oh and free parking because it's $6 to park at the Dal Rae.  Did I mention it's located in Pico Rivera so you can't even watch the Dodger games!",0
2224,5854,"Incredible food. Worth the extra cash. Came on a Thursday to celebrate my girl's promotion and were very surprised at the quality of the food. Great date night spot, the sunset was beautiful from the patio. 5/5",1
2225,5855,"When you take a client to lunch Chic Filet wont close the deal... Dal Rae on the other hand is straight out of an episode of Mad Men! I wanna break out my pencil skirt and smoke a cigarette in a fancy jeweled cigarette holder and wait for Don Draper to give me a light!1950s charm, real servers clearing the crumbs and filling the water glass.I've taken a group of 12 here for lunch and ordered an enormous spread including appetizers, every absolutely everything is good on the menu.Rock Shrimp appetizer and the Marinara salad are my favorites!It's pricey, but what do I work for....",0
2226,5856,"Enrique was an amazing host. He's been very helpful all night and has been making sure we experience an amazing dinner. Thanks to his kindness, he had given me the validation to come back and experience this wonderful night that we have had. Thank you to him and the rest of the staff.",0
2227,5857,This steakhouse is so good! Ordered bone in rib eye steak and it was cooked to perfection. Also comes with sides of veggies and mashed potatoes with crispy onions over the steak. Portions are good. Also add their lobster bisque on Thursdays ... So tasty. Everything was good here. Can't really go wrong with any other their entrees whether it's steak or fish.,0
2228,5858,Enrique and Mark were amazing!!! Made my boyfriend's birthday dinner super special,1
2229,5859,"Who would of thought there's a decent classic steakhouse hidden in the City of Pico Rivera. The place felt so intimate, dim, and quite peaceful.  I had one of those weeks and my friend suggested we try this restaurant. I was so under dressed because I had no idea there were a steakhouse here.  I must say the choices of each dishes was delicious.  We shared the table side Mexican style Caesar Salad topped with endless garlic my favorite, Baked oysters, Pepper Steak, Table side Banana fried dessert and Lava Chocolate Cake. I was very satisfied with the service and the dishes. My only complaint might be the steak. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought. Kind of bland. It came with Mash potatoes and veggies. I'd recommend this place if you're on the area. I enjoyed the table side entrees as the waiter is preparing your dish in front of you! Place is nice and clean!",0
2230,5860,"Definitely some old school charm to this place, a restaurant the Rat Pack would hang out at.  Came here for a work lunch, it's pretty much the only nice sit down establishment in the area.Service was a little on the slow side but I will let them slide due to the lunch crowd.  Ordered the seared ahi tuna for lunch which was excellent.  It came with a wedge cut salad and boy someone went to town on the dressing, it was crazy how much they put on.Definitely on the pricey side!",1
2231,5861,"A very lovely old fashioned steakhouse in the hood, and I never knew about this place! We went for dinner on Chinese new year eve, this place was packed for a Wednesday? All those people couldn't be out for Chinese new year, guess this steakhouse is a neighborhood favorite for sure!I really liked the big menu, for a steakhouse, there are so many seafood choices, extensive selections of everything, how awesome is that! We started off with a bottle of red Bordeaux, hubby really likes this wine, it was tasty for me too, but I am never a big fan of red wine.The very good:Escargot, half dozen in shells, with garlic butter and herbs: the escargot meat was so tender, the sauce was extremely flavorful, loved it.10oz. Filet mignon in signature pepper sauce, which was green onion and peppercorn bacon mixture: this cut was cooked to the perfect rare plus, so tender and moist, hubby loved the pepper sauce, he said it was so amazingly flavorful and delicious!The good:Complimentary radish plate: I think it's very good they have a radish plate for dining people! The radish veggies were so fresh and tasty!Fresh fish seared Ahi in medium rare, with choice of garlic mashed potatoes: the fish was very fresh and tender, it just needed a bit more seasoning. Our waitress saw me eating it with A1 steak sauce, asked if I needed wasabi and soy sauce, she should've asked me earlier, I was almost full, and I didn't know they had wasabi?! Oh well, at least I loved the mashed potatoes.The OK:Sautéed mushrooms and table bread: they were just OK, nothing special.Half white chocolate and half chocolate soufflé: I am not a fan of soufflé, it just tastes too mushy for me, but the flavors were pretty good though.We loved our slow and quiet steak dinner, our waitress was very friendly and sweet, a very pleasant dining experience! I would say it's great to have an upscale steakhouse that's not too far from us! And the piano bar and lounge area looks intimate and romantic in an old fashioned way, love it!Ps. Valet in front of restaurant for $4.5 on a Wednesday.",0
2232,5862,"After years of wanting to try this restaurant I finally did last Saturday. My only regret is waiting so long to try it. The tomahawk steak was delicious all the food was plated nice as well. Our waitress Lydia was very kind and warm, thank for a lovely evening.",0
2233,5863,"Old Hollywood glamor type place with delicious food and wonderful service.Entertainment is great,  I don't know if there is supposed to be dancing but we always do anyway and other's quickly join in.Great for a date, birthday or anniversary! !A little pricey but oh so worth it!Valet parking",0
2234,5864,"We made a reservation for indoor dining - earlier than we would ordinarily dine. This was not honored. They escorted us to outside dining. I pointed out that there were indoor and outdoor options and I clearly selected indoor since they are open now. Oh, that's merely a request we were told as we were escorted to the parking lot / outside dining. It's probably going to be a long time before we come back - don't want to eat here in the parking lot. It was a special occasion too. Disappointed. Food was very good; ambiance was poor.",1
2235,5865,"Family and I look forward to dining at Dal Rae every time for lunch or dinner. I like to try a different dish each time because I am never disappointed. Not only do I enjoy the food, but the service and atmosphere is sooo worth it. Dal Rae takes me back into time with their decor and music, which I enjoy.Yes, it can be pricey and if you haven't dare to dine in this fabulous steakhouse, check out their happy hour special, available Monday through Friday from 3pm to 6pm. If you're a sports fan, there are screen TVs around the bar area to catch a game or two.",0
2236,5866,Where do I start with this horrible establishment . First off . Since the beginning it shows that the place is outdated and needs to be updated I felt like I was in the 50s! The first impression was the bread bowl which was cold and hard bread so was the rock hard butter . So me and my family went for Mothers Day weekend and was hoping for a way better experience . So they had a special menu for the holiday which was very slim and not many options . I went for something new which was the rib eye steak . When i received it I thought it looked delicious . But then I cut a piece to see if it was cooked the way I ask and it was not . On top of that I found a hair and was furious . I was already upset because the lobster soup was VERY salty and my family member also got over cooked steak . So as I was disgusted with the food I was looking for the owner so I can show him so he knows first hand what he let people serve . The owner Kevin came and I showed him the hair and he looked at me like it was not a problem at all with him . And he said right away that he was going to give me a fresh one and I being disgusted said I did not want to eat anymore . He then goes to tell me that im a growing man and tells me to try this other steak which was the prime rib and he said he was going to give me a free dessert for the hassle . And when the new prime rib steak comes it looked so undercooked and bland . Also I need to add that my first steak took well over 30 minutes to get there and this new steak took less than 5 which was very suspicious . I took one bite and I did not like it one bit . To top off the night we get the creme brulee dessert to have together and mention that the owner said he was going to give us it for free . But when the check comes that is when things got even worse . The owner still had the nerve to still charge for the steak that had the hair in it !! Talk about greedy owners of an outdated restaurant. So when we talked to the waited she said she was going to talk to the owner so he can take it off and then once he took it off the bill we then notice that they added the dessert that was supposed to be for free !! This place is a huge disaster . Greedy owners and outdated and also its a facade. It looks classy and upscale but in reality when you take a close look it is just a regular steakhouse with dimmed lights . Never coming back again.PS: i gave my dogs the prime rib steak . Surprised they ate it !,0
2237,5867,"The service is beyond excellent, the food is amazing and they have a menu with many choices. They are known for their pepper filet mignon which is delicious. Second time here and can't say enough good things about this establishment. Thanks to a friend who turned me on to this restaurant I will be coming back for more.",0
2238,5868,Groth winemaker dinner was fantastic! Never disappointed when coming to Dal Rae for dinner. The prime rib eye steak with chimichurri sauce was delicious! Service is always top notch. The wine pairings were right on!,0
2239,5869,"I have been a Dal Rae fan since 1997 - the year I met my now ex-husband.  I had a reception here. I once went to a baseball game with Loren, his wife and my then-husband. I have never had a better time. Loren is a OOAK, and I'm sure Landon is in college! Anyway, enough nostalgia. Go to the Dal Rae. They know you by name and they treat you amazingly. The food is delicious and table side salads and other yummy deliciousness is there for the taking. I may not share love between the ""wasband"", but I'll always love the Dal Rae and Loren!  Best drinks around too! Trust me. I don't lie.",1
2240,5870,"Loved the old school vibe with the dark paneling, fixtures and tableside food preparation. My boyfriend and I chose the menu items you can't find easily/we have never had before...oysters rockerfeller, duck l'orange and cherries jubilee. The Caesar salad prepared tableside was by far my favorite part of the meal. You wont regret it!",0
2241,5871,"I seriously love this place! Has a awesome patio with a fireplace and very cozy inside ...full bar , love the bread butter, and the veggies they bring out as complimentary before the meal/appetizers .... their fried zucchini is TO DIE FOR!!!! will definitely go back love it here! Drinks are awesome to!!",1
2242,5872,"This place is way too fancy for being in this neighborhood.  $6.50 for valet o.O;;  The portions are HUGE here but only the entrees are good.  The service was okay, not great.  I ordered the wine pairing suggestions with my appetizer and entree and my waitress brought both of them out halfway through my appetizer.  I told her that I wanted the suggested pairings for the appetizer and entree but I guess I didn't tell her that I wanted them as each dish came out.-Bread basket:  The bread was stale and super chewy, while the crackers were out to crack.my.tooth.-Petrale Sole Gartel:  Teeny tiny!  And it was lukewarm, not very appetizing.  It had the texture of cooled down melted cheese block.-Dal Rae Pepper Filet:  This was a HUGE piece of meat!  And it was absolutely tasty at medium rare!  And so soft =d  The asparagus on the plate felt more like a garnish than an accompaniment to the protein.  No flavor, limp, boiled...?-Chilean Sea Bass ""ala Ben"":  Pretty tasty!  But Chilean sea bass is always a delicious piece of fatty fish.-Creamed corn:  So sad!  The corn was overcooked and flavorless.  I recently bought corn in the supermarket and it was sweet so I was hoping but no...-Mac and cheese:  Pretty bland and the noodles were overcooked.-Mashed potatoes:  The best side of the night.-Fries:  I'll tell you this, they give a HEFTY amount of fries.  Standard though.-Garlic cheese bread:  Oily and yummy!  But better when hot!  I'm a bit confused as to why my waitress came by with a basket, opened it and had us take the bread out...the other tables were allowed to keep their baskets to keep the bread warm...Maybe it was my mistake for showing up early for my reservations and therefore sitting on the patio instead of inside the dining room.  But it was such a nice night and the fireplace created such a nice ambiance.  The dining room also seemed VERY loud.Outside of DineLA, I'm not sure I'd come back here...but even then, so many other restaurants to try during DineLA Restaurant Week.",0
2243,5873,"The halibut was awesome.Mashed potatoes great.Mac and Cheese sucked as did the scalloped potatoes.Here is the part that made this night bad. I was told the filet mignon was awesome; it was not. It was tougher than steaks at chain restaurants and cooked incorrectly. Plus the waitress was not at all attentive but that could be as they looked to be short staffed. Either way, for the prices I don't think I'll go back. I go here for work meetings but for pleasure maybe never again.",0
2244,5874,"Absolutely love this local hidden gem. Great ambiance and environment. Two dinning rooms and bar area. Ordered this evening the Wagyu, bone in rib eye, and filet mignon paired with Cabernet. Amazing every bite.",0
2245,5875,"Totally disappointed with Del Rae on Valentine's Day.  I cannot recommend this place to anyone for a special occasions based on what I experienced tonight. They totally over-booked for Valentine's Day and I can only blame management for that.  On arrival for our 7pm dinner I could tell they were already filed up with cars in their parking lot (no other real parking options for this restaurant). BTW they charge $6.00 just to park at this high priced restaurant.I love the piano bar....but there we were until after 8:15 waiting for our 7pm reservation. Finally, seated almost an hour and a half after our original reservation, I suspected we were already in big trouble. Our waitress did the best she could with what was an apparently back up kitchen, but not once but did anyone come over and advises or apologize to us that the kitchen was backed up for at least an hour. Just to get the salad took about 30 minutes. We waited and waited but our meal was nowhere in sight. Finally just about 930 we decided we couldn't wait any longer, we advise the waitress and I advise the manager to just charge us for what we had a salad and a couple drinks.We left totally disappointed with Dal Rae Restaurant and don't plan to return..... shame on management for mishandling Valentine's Day.",0
2246,5876,I have been going to the Dal Rae since 1974 when it was owned and run by Bill and Ben Smith. 43 years later it is still in the family with Bens sons Kevin and Lorin still doing a fantastic job.  The food is still the best in Los Angeles. From the pepper New York steak to the best chopped salad in the world. Service is always impeccable. I am always greeted by name and have never had anything but a 5 star meal.  My wife and I went there on our 2nd date and 36 years and 5 kids later we all go as a family. WONDERFUL.  Thanks Kevin and Lorin for continuing the tradition for all these years.  Went for early dinner last night 1-23-19. As good as ever. Had the filet and the sea bass a la Ben. Service and food outstanding. Can I give 10 stars?,0

2249,5879,"Great upscale restaurant. Awesome food, good service and a DJ playing oldies from the 60's and 70's. My first time visiting, but definitely not my last. Will be bringing the family for dinner here soon.",0
2250,5880,Drove by this on Saturday and thought I'd give it a try so on Sunday I stopped by to get some dinner. I ordered the Bone in Rib- Eye Steak and let me tell you it was amazing !! The food was amazing as well as the service !! Do recommend I will come back soon.,1
2251,5881,What can I say? Tonight was our first time back in a couple of years. The Dal Rae is my favorite restaurant and not surprising it did not disappoint! Everyone is friendly and they awake a great effort to provide an enjoyable dining experience.,1
2252,5882,"This is the fifth time I have eaten at this place and I've always had a good experience - and that's to be expected considering I highly doubt people go out and spend $200 to expect bad experiences.  Anyhow, I should have left positive reviews the previous four times but I'm leaving this review in hopes the management reads this and makes appropriate changes.  I came here the Friday before Mother's Day for a dinner with my wife (mother of 3 amazing kids and a beautiful person) and made reservations at 8:00pm.  Unfortunately we were not seated until 8:20 and that's not the worst part - after being seated, we were not offered water until 8:30 and no one came to take our order, offer bread or even take drink orders until I had to flag down a waitress - and this was 8:45 when I finally complained.  I appreciate that after I complained, Kent, the manager came and apologized and tried to make things better, but seriously - it wasn't until 9:05 did we get our Caesar Salad.  But as always the food was great - we ordered the NY and Filet with the peppers, crab cakes, and the Caesar salad with two glasses of wine and a meal that ended much better than it started.",0

2254,5884,"I had only been to Del Rae once before for a business lunch several years ago. I do not even remember what I had. We recently went to a weeknight dinner with the bosses and a vendor of ours who had sold us couple of pieces of equipment.I wanted to have a light dinner so I only ordered their Calamari appetizer. Others had their fresh Fish, Steak, Wine, Soda, Cocktails, etc.Pros:Extremely good service. Very personable. Water was refilled on point, Wine glasses were adequately filled, bread kept coming, etc. Owner came to narrate a couple of corny jokes to our group twice during our dinner. (+1)Cons:Dark inside as is the case with all the fine dining restaurants. Since I am an infrequent diner at such establishments, the dim lit lighting bothers me for the few Hours I am there.Surprisingly, my food was not good. Calamari was too oily and too bland. Sauce was not spicy. It was an unforgettable dish for the wrong reasons. (-2)$4.50 valet? Silly to charge customers for valet when a restaurant has its own parking lot, I think. Just my opinion.The service was top notch, but the fact that a dish was disappointing made me a little sad. I had heard really good things about this restaurant from the old timers. I should order their Steak the next time to get a measure of what their Kitchen core competency is.",0
2255,5885,"Celebrating a friend's Birthday! Enrique the waiter was amazing thank you for the great service, we will be back.",1
2256,5886,"I do not understand the hype at all. Came here with my husband and from the moment we stepped through the door, it was all downhill from there. We were about an hour early for our reservation, and the hostess said that's fine we can seat you. At that time she did not mention that we would be eating outside. When we went back in to ask if we could be seated indoors the hostess very rudely told us that there was only seating outside (I'm not exactly sure about that as there were empty booths when we walked through the restaurant, but they were probably saved for reservations earlier than ours). Another thing that I found very strange was that we couldn't order a drink and sit at the bar; instead we would have to stand outside with a drink next to the valet stand. After all of this, we should have left, but after hearing how ""amazing"" this place was we decided to stick it out. Bad decision. So we get seated outside. I'm not sure if the smoking area was still in place, or if it was all the traffic from the major street we were off of, but of course I end up having an asthma attack. Our waitress comes, we ask menu questions and she does answer the questions, but the responses are very snarky. Whatever. We end up ordering their famous pepper steak. I get the filet, my husband gets the New York steak. The pepper steak topping was ok, but for both of us, it tasted like our steaks were not seasoned. The meat itself was flavorless. My rice pilaf was undercooked as well. The baked potato was the saving grace of the meal. At this point I had another asthma attack, so it was absolutely time to go home. Our waitress was nowhere to be found, and we had the flag down a busboy and another waitress to find her for us. The experience that we had does not warrant a return.",0
2257,5887,"First time here last Thursday and I I'd like to formally declare that I had one of the best dining experiences ever. Let me start with the actual establishment. The restaurant is a bit dated, but that's a good thing because as I walked in, it made me feel as if I was a part of classy history as there are tables and booths everywhere decorated in white table cloths; the lights were dim making it a very romantic setting; there was a pianist performing at the bar; and there were lots of employees working.The employees are amazing. All of the employees were very helpful. All employees made conversation and were very pleasant. My waitress was wonderful. I wish I remembered her name. Next time I visit, I will make sure to ask for her name and update this review.The food was stupidly delicious! I ordered from the pre-fixed menu available as part of the Dine LA experience and it was a great value. I ordered the fried zucchini as an appetizer and it DELICIOUS AND PLENTY!! Next I had their signature pepper filet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes. It was all delicious!!! The steak had a delicious smokey taste to it and it was cooked perfectly. The garlic mashed potatoes were also delicious and plenty! Finally, I had the raspberry cheesecake for dessert.I will definitely be back! I want to bring family next to this wonderful establishment.",0
2258,5888,"Stay away! Ruined Christmas dinner. An hour wait for prepaid. Preordered meal. Substitutions were made at restaurant discretion without customer input. Came home to missing items, and FROZEN substituted dessert. No effort by restaurant staff at restitution. Comments on Facebook were deleted three times, yet no one picks up phone to try to resolve this situation. So, active social media presence to remove negative reviews, but no one answering phones? Shameful, stay away for your holiday dinner. A logistical nightmare.",0
2259,5889,"Every time I eat here I feel like I'm in the movie GOODFELLAS. It's got that cool, dimly lit, nostalgic vibe to it. Definitely one of our favorites.",1
2260,5890,"What can I say...I'm a regular. Every few months my girlfriends and I ""meet in the middle"" (coming from PV, OC and SGV) and the Dal Rae is the spot!  We have our favorite table and spend hours catching up. The staff is always attentive and friendly, but never rushes us. Last night I had the pork schnitzel...very decadent, but very good, and the garlic mashed potatoes were delicious. Between the six of us, we've tried quite a bit of the menu...petite filet, chicken piccata, chicken Monterey, Chilean sea bass alla Ben...honestly, I think the only semi disappointing entree one of us tried was the teriyaki chicken with fried rice. It's a great little step back in time, old school steak house. If you're in the area, it's worth a visit.",0
2261,5891,"We have been customers here for years! The food is great and the service is even better!! Carrie is our favorite sweet heart at the restaurant, along with a couple other hard working friendly servers.They have a killer Caesar  salad and my favorite cocktail lemon drop martini. You can not leave without trying the chocolate souffle. The spot is small and cozy and you leave wanting to come back the next week.This place is an la classic and definitely a must try.",1
2262,5892,"Had a great dinning experience. Amazing staff and food. Expensive food, but it does match upto the quality of food and presentation. Parking is an issue but other then that had a good experience and will be returning again.",1
2263,5893,"We came to celebrate a birthday and had a nice time. Think throwback restaurant with big portions. I was able to try a little of everything: the Caesar salad, the iceberg salad, the famous pepper strip steak, the Chilean sea bass, and the prime rib. I shared the sea bass, which I thought was worth sharing, but beware there is an $8 split charge. It is pricey but we really couldn't finish all the food and you still get your own portion of a side (I got the mashed potato) and veggies (asparagus).The Caesar salad is made table side and it is obvious it is a classic at the restaurant; the way it is made is a well-oiled machine. Our server was kind enough to ask if we wanted to share it three ways (which was much more worth it since it was $20). I liked the salad but found the raw garlic too pungent and sharp. My dad was a happy camper with his iceberg. For the main entree, I would definitely get both the pepper steak and the sea bass again. The sea bass is on the heavier side as it is very creamy, but cooked perfectly and very juicy. The pepper is not too spicy but does have a kick. Prime rib was also well-flavored and tender. It is worth nothing almost everyone had a to-go box.We brought our own cake (beware there is a ~$2/person charge) and with the corkage fee, I thought the dinner was a little expensive. The restaurant was very busy and there was live music on Saturday night, so not a bad option for a nice outing with the family.",0
2264,5894,Dine LA - another  wonderful dinner at our favorite restaurant.  We started with cocktails in the bar  - Eric makes a killer Old Fashion and Lemon Drop.  Onto a tasty  dinner - Chilean Sea Bass a la Ben.  Dawn our server  was attentive and very friendly.  The Pepper steak and Garlic mashed potatoes were also yummy.,0
2265,5895,"Again despite everything going on in the World and the restaurant industry, the Dal Rae gives you and your guests that Dining experience we have been missing. We were celebrating my daughters 30th, so only the best, her choice!!  We were greeted by two charming ladies, Marcie and Kelly on spot as usual. We were seated by a wall fountain, didn't even know I was outside !!! Server was Jennifer without a doubt she will be requested again !!!!  Drinks were perfect from Manhattans, Lemon drops Expresso martinis all perfect ! Thanks for that . Now the reason .... oysters Rockefeller, so good we ordered it again. The Sole, Lamb chops, streaks and Halibut, none better! A special thanks to the Kitchen for always doing it right!!!! See you all soon !Ciao Rory",0
2266,5896,"Another great meal at one of the few Classic Restaurants left.  Celebrated my daughters Birthday...Of course the whole family wouldn't miss the restaurant for the world. As Usual your experience starts when you walk in the Door. Marcie as usual did not disappoint, with her total professionalism to her wonderful smile, I knew the night would be great!! Our Party of 6 were seated immediately ( we did have reservations which is always a good idea ) Our server Dawn was right on cue, telling the specials to our drink order. I believe the Bartender name was Barry, very few are better!! Are Martinis we're spot on !! Now for the food  started with Oysters Rockefeller  they were the best, table side Caesar tossed with the story of its origin was Spot on. Dinners were Pepper steak, Sole, Osso Buco, Pork chop, Seabass and my favorite  Liver and Onions don't laugh it's one of the best around!  I was Chef for over 30 years at some very fine restaurants.  Our Party of 6 said it was one of the best meals we ALL can remember. Thanks everyone especially the Kitchen for a meal to remember. One problem it's an 1 hour and 20 minutes from my house  oh well can't wait till the next time !!! See you soon, not soon enough !!Ciao Chef Rory",0

Starting with our Martinis  old school perfect, to Oysters Rockefeller  to Caesar salad table side, Chilean sea bass, Osso bucco to the Sole. All were fantastic!! As usual the Owner coming by to check that everything was great !!  It was.  Being a Chef for 30 years and knowing what it takes to maintain this service and Quality for so many years, I applaud you all. On a side note, having to deal with people who don't get it.

2271,5901,"*dine la dinner experience *Food: dal rae filet mignon: cooked medium rare perfectly. Very soft. However, they wasn't any seasoning or sauce. It is slightly flavorful but you would wish there's more. No special garnish on it either. Got a side of mashed potatoes which was ok.Crabmeat stuffed mushroom : I really liked this one. Basically crabmeat stuffed in mushroom with cheese melted on top. Really yummy but only 2 pieces. Wished there was more.Fried zucchini: it was ok. Nothing too special. (So was the soup of the day)Salad: Just a big lettuce strip with salad sauce, tomato,  and cheese.Lamb shank: soft and flavorful. Very big portion too. The meat can easily peel off. But nothing too special.Sea bass: big portion and cooked well especially for fish dishes. Most places can easily overcook fishes but this was seasoned and cook well.Cheesecake was ok. Strong taste. Creme Brule was soft inside but the burnt top was too burnt. So the creme Brule was just sweet and burnt bitter. The ice cream sundae was actually the best dessert. Sweet and crunchy.Service: really nice server. Slightly slow though because it was busy that night.  The dine la menu was in the regular menu but I got a dine la lunch menu. My mom got the dine la dinner one. And everyone's menu didn't even have a dine la paper. So we had to take turn reading the dine la menu.Interior : dark. The main room has a bar and a band (jazz?). More dark in there too and there are sometime people dancing for fun. In my opinion,  a really loud restaurant. I couldn't even hear my sister who was across from me.Exterior : valet parking only. So that's nice. The outside has an old American style to it.Overall, the dine la experience was mediocre.",0
2272,5902,Old school classic steak house. Everything is delicious . Portions are large. Plus the give you fresh bread and a crudités plate. Service is great. Full bar and live music.  Valet parking,0
2273,5903,"Was definitely disappointed with this place. Besides our server being very friendly and having a nice ambiance, the Dal Rae is a below average steakhouse. I ordered the 36 oz. bone in Tomahawk Ribeye medium rare for $96 and it was no more than 24 oz. and overcooked. To drink I ordered an Old Fashioned which usually has 1 large ice cube but mine came with a scoop of ice which is very tacky for a classy drink. My next drink was a Martini in a bucket glass  for $17 and it was less than half full. I would have to say that a low end steakhouse like Outback has better food and drinks for half the price. Steakhouses like Ocean Prime, Eddie Vs, Flemings, Ruth's Chris, The Ranch, Mastros, and Mortons are in a different stratosphere.",0
2274,5904,"This review is regarding my recent visit on Saturday evening, January 11th,2020.From the moment me and my party walked in, we sat ourselves at a tiny wonky table in the front and  right away a server took away one of our chairs without even asking which was a bit rude.We then received service by a blond, female who was a decent waitress but because it was so busy, she was not as attentive as we hoped for we waited at least 20/30 minutes for our salads and even longer to order a alcohol beverage so we ordered from the bar.My friend asked  a server to take a picture of us and the server did so- but rolled her eyes and seemed quite annoyed.Overall point of this review is we felt very unwelcome.The plus side was the live music. Very good!As the evening came to a end we attempted to express our feelings of disappointment to the restaurant manager Kent.Kent was shockingly uncooperative, unapologetic and unfriendly. He did not care to hear what we had to say and that grew frustration on our behalf and things turned argumentative right away which resulted in Kent actually walking away from us which is very unprofessional.I'm hoping the owner of this restaurant councils not only hIs staff but Kent as well to have a friendlier, attentive,professional attitude towards their customers because we definitely did not deserve to be treated this way, and unfortunately will not be returning to this location because of how we were treated.I hope this review is taken seriously.Thank you for your time.",0
2275,5905,Love the ambience here. Classic restaurant and the staff is very friendly. Food is tasty and definitely worth the experience and money. They just don't make restaurants like this anymore around here. I tried the poor man's pepper steak and the salmon and both were delicious! Bartender John knows how to make a stiff cocktail which I appreciated and Dawn with the flower in her hair was a great server to us!,1
2276,5906,"We have been coming here for many years.The other night was the worst ever.We had a party of 5.Our server Monica was very nice but seemed to be in a total state of confusion the entire evening.Salad orders were totally wrong and we ended up"" borrowing"" Caesar dressing from the table next to us. Wedge order was screwed up as well.Salmon was massively overcooked and dry. Ordered medium!Prime rib that was ordered medium was very rare. Baked potato was cold.My ribeye had no seasoning that I could taste and was cold. I've had better steak at outback.Creamed corn was finally delivered half way through the meal. Was good.On a positive note, the souffle was excellent.I've read all the positive reviews but I believe that this restaurant no longer lives up to it's glorious past.Sorry.",0
2277,5907,Hey I'm a fan! Old skool steak house! My husband and I had the prime rib and I thought it tasted better than Lawrys...The brother in law and the rib eye and it was okay. He felt like it should have been more flavorful.I would totally come back;),0
2278,5908,"This place is amazing first I'll start with the staff .   There on top of everything, even silly annoying questions are answered with a smile. The food is amazing with a fair price for what you get. I went with the calf's liver with onions and bacon, no doubt about it the best within the area. Next time I'll hope to have room for desert!  How could I forget to mention the amazing bar. No need to order a double here!",0
2279,5909,"The food was great, and service was good. Fire grilled Artichoke was good, and the Garlic bread had me asking for some to go.The Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection and taste amazing!!

2280,5910,"A very belated review of Dal Rae, where I celebrated one of my milestone birthdays!I had heard rave reviews from co-workers and others about Dal Rae and decided to dine here and celebrate the end of a particular decade. Reservations were made on Open Table and we arrived at 6:30 pm on a Sunday with minimal wait.Dal Rae is located in an area that looks like very much in the now, but the place itself reminds me of the 50s. The interior is reminiscent of Morton's, with dim lighting, deep colors and a business-like environment (a la business lunches).We started with the ahi toast ($17.50). It came in 6 pieces, with wasabi on the side that didn't really hit you in the nose as regular wasabi does. It was good, but didn't feel like $18 good.I read that they prepare the Caesar salad for two tableside and since BF is a fan of Caesar salad, that was a no-brainer order. We were sitting in a booth that had a very narrow walkway and I heard the server mentioning that they may not be able to make it tableside for us. Luckily they found a way, because if they didn't, there would be plenty to argue as they had prepared the salad tableside for the large table right in front of us and there is no way we would be paying $19.75 for not having the show portion of ordering the Caesar salad. They make the dressing right in front of you, and I did not know prior that Caesar dressing includes Worcestershire sauce and tabasco sauce. Note that this is only offered for dinner and not lunch.From past experiences, there was no way I would not order what a restaurant is known for, so my main entree was the 16 oz. Dal Rae Famous Pepper Steak Prime New York ($48.50). BF matched me with his Diamond Jim Brady cut of prime rib ($48.75). Given it's been wayyy over a year from the meal to finishing this review and we don't have very positive impressions from the meat, that gives you an idea of how memorable the main course was.Of course, with most of my meals, I wanted something off the dessert menu. We chose the gold brick sundae ($7.95), which was served in a lace cookie. Yummy! With the benefit of a long overdue review, the sundae was good at that time, but after experiencing a few more restaurants, BF much prefers the hot fudge sundae from Tam O'Shanter's.A 3.5 star experience rounded up to 4.",1
2281,5911,"My dear husband took me here for our wedding anniversary dinner, and we had a pleasant time.  One of our traditions is to go to steakhouses for our anniversary, but since I'm pregnant, I am not able to eat under-cooked meat.  Dal Rae was nice because it had a lot of other options.They start you off with a huge basket of bread (includes sourdough and this peppery cracker which my husband liked) and a crudite plate. The veggies were placed on top of ice, so it was kind of weird after the ice melted.  Vegetables were served without any dipping sauce.  Haven't seen a crudite starter, so I guess its a plus either way.  Just thought they would have something with it.  They also offered garlic bread, but we weren't going to finish what they gave us, so we declined.We started off with sharing the French onion soup, which was excellent.  My husband had most of it because he had never had *real* French onion soup.  Broth was nice and meaty and salty.  The bread and cheese on top were perfect.  For our entrees, my husband had the pepper steak, and I ordered the sea bass.  My husband enjoyed his dish, and I enjoyed the sea bass as well.  This is more of a preference thing, but both of the dishes came with a lot of sauce and extra flavors.  Seems a little sad that the quality of the protein was not allowed to shine by itself, but the sauces and flavors were good.  I really enjoyed the Parmesan crust on the fish, except sometimes I felt like that was all I tasted.  The mashed potatoes I got for our sides as well as the cooked asparagus were fairly bland and nothing to write home about.Overall, a solid restaurant and a great experience.  Clean restrooms, great service, and a nice place to eat.  A little dark inside, but the old-school atmosphere hearkens back to a different decade without feeling ancient.  Definitely can sense that this place was happening a few decades ago.NOTE: There is ONLY valet parking here for $4.50.  No self park option.  The valet service was quick and efficient.",0

2286,5916,"Legendary food, great service and an absolutely fantastic ""Dine LA"" deal this week & next at this iconic, very retro monument to excellent meals and corporate expense accounts!  Like a step back in time to the oak and leather steak houses of years past.A perfectly grilled 12 oz. prime Filet topped with their signature Peppercorn, bacon and green onion sauce, baked potato, asparagus, preceded by a choice of three different salads, lobster bisque or a perfect appetizer of fresh, seared scallops in a divine cheese & horseradish sauce.  This is all followed by a dessert choice of cheesecake or an absolutely sublime dessert called a Gold Brick, involving ice cream, milk chocolate, hardening chocolate and a gold molded confectioner's lace cookie.Coffee and tea as well...all for the incredible price of $49 per person!  Your bill would usually be over twice that much!",0

My boyfriend ordered the petite prime rib which was as huge as it was delicious!  The chocolate and blueberry martinis are great.   We also loved the garlic mashed potatoes.  You gotta come hungry.... All of the portions are huge.  Plus there are complimentary dishes such as fresh bread AND garlic bread and fresh veggies. I would try all if it, especially the garlic cheese bread but don't fill up on it!  Despite being full we ordered the soufflé.  The give you extra sauce and whipped cream on the side which was a lovely touch.  Prices are high, but fairly reflect the quality and quantity of the meal.

2301,5931,"Came here to celebrate a friend's bday.  After we were seated, we were brought bread and a relish tray which had green onion, radish, carrot sticks, celery sticks, cucumber, tomato, and some pickled peppers.  The veggies were all really fresh and crisp.  We all ordered the Dal Rae Famous Pepper Steak in the 10oz filet mignon size.  As indicated on the menu, all entrees come with a side of veggies and a choice of side, either regular mashed potato or garlic mashed potato, baked potato, rice pilaf, fries, brown rice and sliced tomato.  Apparently, we didn't see the veggie part when we were ordering and decided to order an extra sides of grilled asparagus and creamed spinach.  I really wished the waitress would have pointed out to us that the veggies included in the order was asparagus already when we ordered the side of asparagus..then we would have chosen some other side to try instead of having a mountain of asparagus!!!  Guess it was our fault for not asking what type of veggie was included before we ordered. So  basically we ended up having 3-4 spears of asparagus on our entree plate....and bunch on the side.  As for the peppersteak...it really wasn't very peppery and was pretty bland.  I'm usually not a fan of overly salty foods, but the steak I got was really under seasoned and just lacked flavor overall.  The rest of my group also indicated that their steaks were under seasoned as well.  The steak was cooked to my requested doneness of medium rare, but just didn't have the savory kick I was looking for.  My side of garlic mashed potato was absolutely divine.  It was seasoned nicely, super creamy, smooth, and had a strong kick of garlic.  One of my friends chose the loaded baked potato...with everything.  It literally had butter, chives, sour cream, cheese sauce, and bacon bits.  This was also tasty, but not as good as the garlic mash IMO.The grilled asparagus was cooked nicely and still maintained a crisp texture.  The creamed spinach was different than any I've had.  It had a really creamy texture, but didn't look like it had a lot of ""cream"" in it.  It seemed to have a strong taste of nutmeg or cinnamon...like really strong.  I didn't mind it too much, but the rest of my group didn't like it.We ordered a couple drinks and OMG it was so strong that they could only take a few sips.  It was like rubbing alcohol laced with sugar.  Yuck.  I mean the drink smelled pretty good..but just way too much alcohol.We ordered the flourless chocolate cake and that was pretty good too.  The cake was very dense and baked to order, topped off with a coffee ice cream.  The cake wasn't overly sweet and paired well with the coffee ice cream.Parking is valet for $3.50 + tip.  Reservations are recommended since the place was pretty full when we arrived on a Friday night.",1

2303,5933,"Went here Tuesday night for an early Christmas dinner with long time friends.  We were seated right away and ordered cocktails to enjoy while visiting.  Jackie was our waitress.  She was great, let us take our time and enjoy ourselves. When we ordered dinner we started with the Brie and pesto appetizer. My friends had sea bass, excellent, and beef tornadoes.  I had to go  for the prime rib eye.  It was delicious.What a delightful evening, lovely holiday decorations, great service and food.  Thank you Dal Rae, we'll be back.",0
2304,5934,"Had a dinner for two on Valentine's day. They had a ""special"" Valentine's day menu we were required to order off of. $80 for soup or salad, entree and dessert.  This Valentine's day menu was extremely limited. Not a single chicken option on it, 90% of the salad selections were gone, many desserts unavailable etc. Basically we paying more per item, forced to order 3 things and with a smaller selection. This would of been ok in my book if they let me know when making the reservation but they did not.If entrees are normally about $40, then you can think of my salad and dessert each being $20. The size of my basically $20 salad was pathetic. I must of got the last of a batch and they were too behind to make me a proper one is my only guess.The food itself was good. I had the famous pepper steak, was a little disappointed NY Strip and Filet Mignon were the only options on it though (I chose NY strip). The green onions and pepper topping is tasty. The steak itself was just ok.My date had the chilean sea bass. It was very very tasty.If not for the poor salad, poor Valentine's menu, and not being told about it when making the reservation, it probably would of been 4 stars. But on this day I'll give it a 2. I've paid less and had far better meals at Maestro's, Flemings etc. Definitely would not recommend going here on Valentine's or any time they do special menus (which apparently is done a few times a year)",1
2305,5935,"The husband and I came here last night for dinner not realizing December is their busiest time of the year (also menu is limited).The husband had the bone in prime rib, which is just a bone-in rib eye steak (if you want traditional prime rib, order the prime ribs of beef - they need to be more clear about this). I had the pepper steak. We also had a chopped salad, their bread, and the relish basket - oh and pecan pie for dessert ;) The beef is definitely prime and cooked perfectly but lacked salt. The salad was amazing - I highly recommend it along with the pecan pie. I'd have to say those were the best tasting items we had.Back to the beef - let me explain. We are HUGE fans of Ruth's Chris. They set the bar on a bomb ass steak and we have yet to find a high end steakhouse that truly competes. Dal Rae, while good, isn't on RC's level. I was expecting a huge flavor bomb with the pepper steak, but that too wasn't all that flavorful. It was a nice touch and had some flavor but much less than expected given how it's sold.Despite the volume of people, service was top notch, food was very tasty, and ambiance was wonderful. We would return to try the traditional prime rib as well as the sea bass and of course, PIE!",0
2306,5936,I've heard about this place for years. Finally got an opportunity to go. Celebrating my father in laws birthday. Menu is filled classic steak and seafood dishes from the past. I decided to go the Bone-in Prime Ribeye Steak with the Bordelaise Demi Glacé. Meat was super high quality and tender. Asked for med rare and it was spot on. They still make several things table side like Caesar Salad and classic desserts like Cherries Jubilee.  Service was superb and the managers came by to check on us throughout the meal!  Would love to comeback and try some other dishes!,0
2307,5937,Bad service The food Bad quality basically I don't recommend anybody go there !!!!!!The price sounds like I am in Beverly Hills or more,1
2308,5938,"Just had dinner here with my girlfriend tonight, food was spectacular as always. Started coming here when I was able to afford it at around 20 and haven't looked back. Typically I eat on the west side when I want to break the bank a bit but always find myself coming back to old faithful as the pricing is less than most places in west LA and the food is as good or better. 10/10 would recommend to anyone that is in the area looking for a place to eat a good steak. I always recommend the bone in rib eye, Chilean sea bass, garlic mashed potatoes, Mac and cheese, and last but definitely not least the grand marinier souffle which is recommend to order 20 minutes prior to your finishing dinner. Last thing do not forget to order the table side Ceasar salad it is amazing and the gentleman who makes it always makes great conversation in explaining what is happening with the ingredients of the dressing if you're to ever have any questions about it.",0
2309,5939,"This restaurant was OK in my opinion. It wasn't all that great at all! I came here for the first time 2 weeks ago in December for my friends birthday. The restaurant itself is nice, but the food is pricey and whatever's. The service was horrible! It took us about 2 hours just to get our food and on top of that some of our food were not warm at all. Really, you're gonna make someone celebrating their birthday there including their friends wait almost 2 hours for food?!?!Also some of my friends and I wanted to split our checks and the waitress had a bitch fit simply because some of us wanted seperate checks. I ordered the crab Louie salad. I laughed when I saw it because I could make a way better crab salad than this restaurant! The salad was $23 and I was disappointed that my salad tasted bland. The only good thing I can say is that their garlic cheese bread and fried chicken with tomatoes and avocado was good, but that's about it.I will never come back here again simply because of the bad service and overpriced food.",1
2310,5940,"Yeah Dal Rae!What a gem of a find! We were lucky enough To get a table on Saturday night but it was Cinco de Mayo and most broke we're going with a Mexican restaurant so we swoop down and have an amazing veal Oscar dinner!!! What we found out later that it was the owner who stopped by our table to have a chat... very approachable guy easy to talk to! Our server was excellent I am bummed I forget her name (I think Rosemary) who anticipated our every need and was very knowledgeable about the restaurant, food  and preparation!",1
2311,5941,Great food ! Nothing as good on the area ! Service was great ! Parking is only valet ! So you have no other option ! Will go back for sure,0
2312,5942,"Looking for that special place to do birthday and anniversary dinners? How about Father's Day, Mother's Day, or any other nice holiday??This is the place for you. For over 40 years they've been in this same location (run by the same family, even!) and consistently put out delicious food.  Want to dress up?? This is the place!! If you just feel like business casual that is okay, too. They will welcome you no matter what. I wouldn't do shorts and flip flops, it is just too nice here for that.Some of my favorites (so far) are their AWESOME shrimp cocktail. Yes, I know for $18.95 it better be good, but don't worry. It is EXCELLENT!!!  The shrimp are GINORMOUS and perfectly chilled and cleaned. Just waiting there for you to pop them into your mouth. They are so big it will take at least a couple bites to get each one eaten, you've been warned! The cocktail sauce is really good and not too hot. Just spicy enough to be interesting though.Another favorite is the hand made Caesar Salad. They made it table side last time I was there though I understand at certain times of the year they do not do that. Maybe during the holidays. If you need to be sure, just call them before your visit. While they might have a special menu during holidays and other special events, they will gladly tell you what is available.  They aim to please!One of our family members got the ""Tomahawk Steak"" one time. It was HUGE. Not kidding. Even he couldn't eat the whole thing. They name it that because it actually resembles a tomahawk (hatchet) and I must say they cooked it perfectly. It was huge but still delicious!I'd highly recommend this place for your next special occasion. It is a little on the pricey side but it is WELL WORTH what you will pay. The quality, atmosphere, and great service is so amazing you'll be planning your next trip back!!Enjoy!",0
2313,5943,More than six years coming to this place and the two ladies in the front are always very disrespectful to us. We only go to make our old school grandpa happy since he loves this place.

We feel as if the fact that we're Hispanic and only speak Spanish can contribute to the fact that the two ladies are ru,0

2315,5945,"I live very near this restaurant. To be honest, I never thought much about it because it's so hidden and always just drove by it thinking ""it must be a small eating place"". One day my husband and I decided to try it out. I wasn't expecting it to be the type of restaurant it is. With that being said I went with a very casual attire, I believe tennis shoes and a sweater. To my surprise it was a very nice and big restaurant. Everybody was dressed up. However, I LOVED the fact that every person that attended us made us feel WELCOME. From the person outside receiving costumers, to the waitress. I'd say this is a place to go for a special occasion. I was VERY pleased with the food and service. I think next time I go I'd like to dress up to have a nice romantic dinner with my husband :)I saw family gatherings too. So don't feel like it's only a couple vibe place. It can be on the ""pricey"" side, but honestly it's worth it. The steak by far is one of the cleanest (no fat) and tastiest steak I've had in a while. Check this place out!",0
2316,5946,The best christmas eve meal ever. Didn't have to cook and got all of our favorites from the dal rae! Can't wait to get nye to go!,1
2317,5947,"You have to realize -- this restaurant is throwback to the '50s. I don't think a thing has changed. If you said ""What are your craft cocktails?"" or ""Do you have any IPAs?"" -- they'd likely look at you like you were a martian. It's a place of cigars, polyester and shrimp cocktails. Your grandparents would love it here. That being said - it is what it is. And something about it -- how it's stuck to its surf-n-turf, we-love-iceberg-lettuce-here clientele and decor -- is charming and comforting. And the food is always good. Asparagus isn't too soft. The prime rib is always amazing. The decor is old-lady fancy in an unpretentious way. So I always have a good time here. It's a nice alternative to (sometimes pretentious) distressed barnwood and crispy brussel sprouts.",0
2318,5948,"Nice local steak house spot.  It's dark and intimate inside which makes it for a great date night or anniversary and birthday options, it's just lively enough too.  Everything we ordered was delicious, my steak medallions and my boyfriends filet mignon were both so tender!!  For New Years they had a 3 course special so it was an appetizer, entree and dessert. I got the mixed salad, steak Diane with fries and creme brûlée. My boyfriend ordered the French onion soup, filet mignon with mashed potatoes and tiramisu, he also ordered the oyster Rockefeller's.   It was all so good that we brought some food home because we couldn't eat it all haha.  Service was friendly and attentive too.  We'll definitely be back!",0
2319,5949,"Simply amazing food atmosphere and ambiance we at met there on December 29th and alll fou in our party were very pleased. I had the Alaskan King Ceab yum, another guest the Prime Rib , she enjoyed stand the other couple Had jumbo Lobster and filet, and one Sea bass which looked like the best of all . We will be bAck soon I wish I had taken pictures , but everything from appetizers oysters Rockefeller to the deserts Was a hit!",1

2321,5951,"So I surprised my husband with a family dinner on Christmas Eve to celebrate his 60th birthday.  On what should have been a truly special evening, our guest were asked by Ken, a manager there, if they would like their cars brought up before dessert was finished and before we had been given the bill to settle.  Our guests were told that they had a party  waiting for our table.When I inquired with Ken about this, letting him know my disappointment over what should have just been a very special occasion for us, I was told ""Well, you have been sitting there for three hours!""  Really?Several years ago we had our son's wedding rehearsal here in that same room.  We had recently re-discovered this usually wonderful place to eat and I had so looked forward to surprising my husband and to creating a beautiful 60th memory for him and us.That evening the wait staff did a wonderful job.  Too bad this other member of the staff has left such a negative impression on me, bringing it difficult to bring myself or my family to visit again.As I said to Ken that evening,  I guess they just don't need our business.",0
2322,5952,"Stopped by Dal Rae during a work trip and am glad I did. The restaurant was busy but we were seated immediately. The staff was very attentive and friendly. The bread was fresh and the appetizers were great. For apps we went with the shrimp cocktail and teriyaki tidbits, which were plenty for our party of three. I ordered the peppered New York strip because it was said to be one of the top 100 tastes of LA. It was a good steak, but not the best I've had. The baked potato I ordered as a side was the best part of the meal, not to say that the rest of the meal wasn't good but the stud stood out. Definitely worth a try if you're in town.",0
2323,5953,"Unbelievably delicious..  I had the filet medallions, the filet appetizer. I already booked a reservation for Valentine's weekend. The restaurant itself reminded me of Goodfellas type of atmosphere, looking forward to going next month.",1
2324,5954,"I've been so many times I've lost count. We go every Christmas Eve and I usually also make it another 2 or 3 times a year, if I'm lucky. Yes on certain nights (weekends, holidays) it can get insane and even if you have a reservation you may wait, but the bar is wonderful so who cares. The staff, the food, the entire place is worth it. As many have mentioned, the old school aspect - relish trays, many table side presentations if you order such dishes, the booths - is so comforting and special. But the food is really terrific and the staff makes it all worth it.I'm a big fan of the classic pepper steak, though the green pepper aspect can throw some people. We love starting with both the calamari and the Oysters Rockefeller, both so good. And the table side caesar is justifiably famous. As is the twist on bananas foster for dessert. But, really, you can't go wrong. The seafood is also wonderful.Special mention must go to Marci at the front desk. How she manages the tables in the chaos with such calm grace amazes me. She rocks. And recently Christina gave us some of the best service at the table I've had there, which is saying a lot.Great place!",0
2325,5955,"Another great Christmas Eve! I enjoy going during the year when they do everything table side, of course. But this is always a great Christmas Eve dinner for a few of us. This year, ""MJ"" and ""MM"" were amazing! Incredible service, truly. And the food, as always, was superb. Love the Dal Rae!",0
2326,5956,"Had yet another wonderful meal here on Christmas Eve (an annual tradition.) I make it to the Dal Rae at least twice a year. Wish I lived closer so I could go more. Our server on Christmas Eve was one of the best servers I've ever had. Jackie. She was amazing. But the entire experience is terrific. The bartenders rock, the owners come by to see how things are, the food is excellent, I love the room. The Dal Rae is the best!My favorites: Wonderful table-side Caesar, the pepper steak new York Strip, the calamari with two incredible dipping sauces (their marinara is amazing.)",0
2327,5957,"Been a regular and dining here for about 25 years. Everything on the menu is outstanding, cocktails poured generously, service is attentive and old school proper. The owners are of care always checking in and accessible. The atmosphere, especially during the holidays is lovely and festive. My favorite menu...ahi on toast, crab stuffed artichoke bottoms, oysters Rockefeller, Chilean sea bass with butter caper sauce and crepe brûlée for dessert",0
2328,5958,Holy fken shit this place is the bomb.First time here had the Caesar salad excellent.Shrimp scampi delicious!Had the pepper steak and lobster. Very fillingFor dessert the chocolate soufflé. I could die now.Thank you Ashley for all your great recommendations and wonderful service.,1
2329,5959,"This was the best Prime rib I ever had, the Jim Brady cut was amazing!!! Bone in steaks are hard to beat, cooked perfect taste like heaven! Enrique was our waiter, very friendly and attentive!!! Got our drinks and food with great care!",0
2330,5960,"This restaurant was delicious and the service was attentive throughout the night.  From our glasses always being topped off to crumbing the table- top notch service.They bring a tray of veggies and bread to start.Truly enjoyed the table service of the salad prep. The salads also come with a homemade garlic bread.My entre was the spaghetti del rae.  Perfect choice if you're feeling like carbs.My BF received a small cake slice to celebrate his birthday. It was sweet and a nice way to make dinners extra special.To end the night, we also ordered a cream brûlée and a soufflé.  They also prep the soufflé for you at the table. Delicious as everything else.  My drink for the night was a lemon drop Martini, satisfying!Valet parking only $4.50! Don't forget!",0
2331,5961,Consistently excellent food and service! Great restaurant for celebrating special birthday or anything. Love Chilean sea bass A' Ben style. Pepper steak is amazing!Highly recommend this outstanding place. Valet only parking.,1
2332,5962,"Eh, overpriced and overrated. I much prefer the fish market in Los Alamitos or Mr. V's in La Habra. Service was good. Valet @ $4.50 is just stupid when the parking is 10 feet from the entrance. Quiet and darrrrkkk inside. Came on a lunch date and brought my newborn baby and felt kinda awkward and uncomfortable because it was sooooo quiet.We ordered: chopped salad, which was good. Crab cake appetizer, which was like $18 and tasted like there was a lot of stuffing. Not good. We have had way better. Our fave crab cakes are from Walt's wharf. Very Bueno! For entrees, we ordered shrimp scampi with linguini pasta. They didn't give us the asparagus for that order. It was ok, but lacked flavor because the pasta had no sauce. The second entree was the halibut. It came with potatoes and two asparagus. Lunch entree was only $22.50-very reasonable. It was good but not great.Overall, service was great. Food was just ok, so definitely overpriced at $100 lunch for 2 people and valet was a joke. We won't be in a hurry to go back.",1
2333,5963,"Came here often growing up, and always enjoyed it. Not rating a particular recent experience, but rather all of my dining experiences here, past and present. It's an upscale steak house located in a part of Pico where you would never expect it to exist (right next to Jack in the Box), so it's nice to escape to a restaurant like this without traveling far, especially if you live in the area. I enjoy the steaks and seafood. I also really like their appetizers-never had a bad one. The inside is somewhat dimly lit and reminds one of old Hollywood. Mr. V's in La Mirada is similar to Del Ray. Perfect for date night or a nice dinner. A must try if you haven't already.",0

2335,5965,My all-time favorite restaurant in the greater Downey area. Frank Sinatra Music- this is true class from my generation- more food than you can eat- and did i mention the quality- no one else compares--- I love one of the owners who is usually on site greeting customers- Loren- treats you like royalty- what a kind and humble guy- if you want an experience you will always treasure---make it a date at Dal Rae!,1
2336,5966,"I really enjoy Dal Rae's for special occasions. It also would be great for a business dinner. From the outside, Dal Rae's is somewhat inconspicuous, but on the inside it's a fairly classy place. Valet parking only.I like the vegetable garnish tray they serve on ice before meals. The table bread is just okay. I have had the rigatoni Romano pasta (this is a huge portion... you'll be taking it home for lunch the next day) and the shrimp scampi (large shrimp) with a table-side prepped baked potato. Both meals were great options for me. My husband always gets a steak here. Of course, he cuts me a couple of pieces every time. The steaks here are delicious! Cooked to order and the meat just falls apart when you bite into it. Bloody Marys here are pretty good. So was the white wine.I haven't sat in the bar area or the area beyond the bar. I have sat in the ""main"" area and the section just to the right when you check-in. I was told that this section was quieter, but it wasn't. There was a small group celebrating a birthday & they were pretty obnoxious at the beginning, but slowly piped down. It echoes in that section and it seems not as warm and inviting, so I will not be sitting in that area ever again.The owners, two brothers I believe, are exceptionally nice and professional. The service is excellent... Very accommodating with our baby and responsive with any of our needs. The meals are not particularly affordable. Like I mentioned before, this is a special occasion or business dinner restaurant. It's old school... Like 50s or 60s era restaurant dining, so put on your cocktail dress and have a good time. Call ahead (Marcy is super nice) or make reservations from the Yelp app.Review #186",0
2337,5967,2nd time coming here and it was still delicious as it was the first time I came. I made reservations and then had to change the time and the receptionist was super nice about it. I always cringe when calling to make changes but she made that feeling go away. Celebrated the hubby's birthday and we sat at the Lounge Area instead of dining area because of the time switch. Lounge area is more lively and yes u can order from their full menu in the lounge. I sat at Dining area before n it's more quieter n calmer. Staff very friendly and nice and the entertainment was great. We had a great nite thank you!,0
2338,5968,"Very romantic place to eat and the food here is TOP NOTCH. I had the house special peppered filet mignon that was topped with green onions, bacon bits and special sauce, it was very delicious. They have a large menu with good variety of options. I would definitely come again.",0
2339,5969,"Drinks were good, food was traditional American, service was so slow they missed out on a drink order and a dessert.  Dinner took from 7:40 to 10pm and we ordered everything the moment our server came around the first time.   The tip was adjusted accordingly.For a first time at a restaurant on a Thursday night I expect at minimum a sub par experience, but all I got was Mulligan's and an unapologetic disinterested server. I wanted to like this place so much and it bugs me to rate it so poorly but for the price point harsh but fair rules the day.Eat at the bar.  You're better off, it's harder for a bartender to ignore you.",0

2341,5971,"If there were ten stars, I'd give it! The service and every bit of every meal was exceptional! Our Server, Mary Jane was absolutely perfect! We had the Lamb and the Pepper Filet. Both were awesome. So was the Finely whipped garlic mashed potatoes. What I was particularly impressed with was the Ahi Appetizer. I don't eat sushi, but my Wife ate the fish while I ate the toast with thinly sliced avocado, capers, feta and some sort of possibly olive oil based liquid mix. That was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Simply unexplainable. We had the Sundae and the super soft Rasberry Cheesecake for dessert. Grade A! At the end of the meal, our Host (I forgot her name) offered a complimentary cup of coffee.I could not say enough about our experience! They even played Frank Sinatra that matched the cool dim ambience. We will be back there soon, this I promise you!",0
2342,5972,"My absolute favorite restaurant ever!!! This place does not disappoint. Great ambiance, great music in the bar area and stellar service!!! The food though... everything on the menu is beyond amazing!!!!!! Chilean sea bass, peppered steak, ahi on toast with avocado, I can go on and on!It's very romantic and during the holidays the decorate so beautifully. They really put you in the holiday spirit. The main dining room is so beautiful and very cozy, but the bar area is where all the action is. They have an entertainer who sings all old school music. Kinda like "" the wave"" he's the best!! He has a tip glass and takes request. I suggest sitting in the bar for sure.The have a wide variety of wine and specialty cocktails which makes it so hard to decide. But you can't go wrong with anything you choose.Love this place!!",1
2343,5973,Ambiance: This place feels very old school. Dark yet classy. Be prepared for valet parking.  We had a back room for a large group at Christmas time and it was tastefully decorated and arranged. It was nicely lit even though it was a dimmer setting we could easily see but it was not brightService: waitstaff were very professional and knew the menu.Food:  the food was amazing! The salad was fresh and dressing so tasty. People were raving about the Sea Bass. I had the steak which was seasoned perfectly. One of the best steaks I've ever had!  I have no complaints about the food! I'd give it a 6 if I could!  Price:$$$Can't wait to go for our next Christmas Party!,0
2344,5974,"Yum! Go ASAP!! I love the ""steakhouse vibe""; so cool!! My steak dinner was scrumptious and we ordered cherries jubilee for dessert ... which the make at your table ... Right?!?",1
2345,5975,"Had a fantastic dining experience, celebrating with the family for a birthday.   The food was outstanding, as we did not leave hungry.  The only thing of note was that our server was training a new server who was shadowing her.  I think she had more tables than she normally might, because of this, but she was still highly attentive and friendly. Our first experience was great!",1
2346,5976,When you walk in to Dal Rae you're immediately get that old school vibe. It's a bit dark so if you have any vision problems either hold with whoever you're with and take a flashlight. lol The service is awesome. They're so friendly and courteous.The food is delicious. I had the pepper steak and it was cooked perfectly. The Mrs. has the Chilean sea bass and all I have to say is WOW! That dish was amazing. I almost took the plate away from her. I would definitely go back for that.,0
2347,5977,"My friends and I come here around the holidays to celebrate Christmas each year. The food is very good and the decorations are amazing. It's  nothing short of a Christmas wonderland. The servers are always very friendly and the cocktails are great! I wanted to give this place 5 stars but couldn't bring myself to do it. Every year we come to this establishment the hostesses are so rude and unpleasant. It's like they hate you for being there and they feel like they are doing you a favor bringing you to your seat. It sets a bad tone for the rest of the evening, honestly the last time I came here the older woman at the desk was so miserable looking it made me sad. I heard her telling another patron that she was ""having a shitty morning"". Which I felt was pretty inappropriate. Other then those ladies at the front this place is awesome!",0
2348,5978,"I was at Dal Rae's celebrating a recent engagement with a party of 10. We each decided to order the Dine LA 3 course meal, I got a delicious fried zucchini, decent filet mignon, forgettable creme brulee. Myself and 5 in my party decided to order our steaks cooked to a medium rare. Each of the steaks came out to a different doneness ranging medium rare to well done, luckily I was one of the few that got one cooked to a medium doneness.After a memorable night of fantastic company, it was time for the bill. We waited for 30 minutes until we had to flag down a waiter to follow up on our credit cards. Another 15 minutes passes by. The manager Kent comes over to ask how we're doing. We express our discern about the time it was taking to our credit cards back and Kent continues to make excuses while offering no apology or concern for expediting the process. He jokingly states ""haha they're trying to figure out how to charge you an extra $100."" After making a couple inappropriate jokes and a few degrading comments, Kent leaves. The bill finally arrives after another 15 minutes. On our way out another manager greets us and finally offers an apology, but it's too late, the damage is done.The fact that the manager was so rude and put a bit of a blemish on our night, I cannot recommend this restaurant despite the average food and cool piano bar. You easily find a place with better service when you're spending $100/person.",0
2349,5979,Enrique was my server last night.Went in with my wife to celebrate our anniversary.Had a wonderful time.Enrique was on top of his game.Anticipated all of our needs.He made the evening very special.Food was great.Props to Dal Rae and Enrique,0
2350,5980,"Stopped in the other night for a Valentine's Dinner. No need to sell the Dal Rae to you. If you know you know, if you don't you don't. This place never disappoints and always comes correct with nice stiff drinks from the bar. I had the T-Bone peppered with mashers and she had the Petite Filet with veggies. Throw in a few Long Islands and we were set for the night. Good to see Pico Rivera holding it down with one of the best Restaurants you'll ever eat at. This place has held the test of time and still going strong. A real 5 star place.Honorable Mention: Stiff drinks from the bar!",1
2351,5981,"What can i say about the Del Rae that hasn't already been said in newspapers articles or restaurant review magazines. It's top dollar for this area that's for sure. Most people around these parts of town heard about and know where the Del Rae is, but have never stepped foot in that place. One thing is for sure, the inside looks nothing like it would looking at this place from the outside. The dim dark rooms, great service, stiff drinks and valet service make this Ol' School steak house a must visit for anyone that likes fine dining. There's not too much of that around these parts, considering King Taco, Jack n the Box and Sizzlers are a stones throw away from this place....so take advantage if you can.Honorable mention: Pepper Steak and/or Lobster Thermidor",0
2352,5982,"Updated review to post pics:I met a friend here for drinks and we decided to have some apps vs dinner.  We ordered the french onion soup ($7.95), wedge salad ($7.95) and baked scallops cave de oro ($16.50 - ""golden cave"").  Keep in mind this place is ""Old"" School with a capital ""O"".  They also serve all things unhealthy for you, (but oh so good):  Escargot, lobster thermidor, caesar salad at the table and, the waiters will dress your baked potato for you fully loaded.All meals start w/ an iced vegetable platter.  The vegetables are super fresh and good sized.  A nice way to start before appetizers or a full meal:  4 Stars.The french onion soup was really good.  The broth was nice and beefy tasting, and there was a ton of cheese.  You also receive cheesy/garlic bread w/ the soup.  The bread is off da hook!!!  It was chocked full of flavor:  4 Stars on the soup and 5 on the cheesy/garlic bread.The wedge salad was just OK (I usually order the caesar salad).  When it comes to a wedge salad. I am accustomed to high quality romaine lettuce where the leaves are nice and tight.  In addition, I like the dressing w/ blue cheese crumbles, bacon bits and a little bit of red onion.  This version had none of that (I should have ordered the caesar ;P):  2 Stars.On the other hand, the scallops were excellent.  They were huge and super fresh.  Dal Rae's version contains cheese and a horseradish hollandaise sauce.  The scallops went well very well w/ the bread:  5 Stars.The ambiance is timeless.  I came here for the first time for a business meeting more than 10 years ago.  The place still looks the same and that's cool.  The crowd is also very diverse:  5 Stars.  The service is also very good.  I have eaten in the bar and dining room and the service is always impeccable:  5 Stars.The problem w/ this place is that it is out of the way off Washington and the 605, and it is not in the best neighborhood.  In addition, there is nothing to do afterwards vs all the things to do after dinner in DTLA or West LA.  Otherwise, I would come here more often for some of their decadent dishes.  They have all the things you would see in steak house, plus prime rib, heavy seafood appetizers and a great wine list.  Lastly, there is no shortage of hawties.  Too bad it was the day before VDay and there were a lot of couples celebrating early :/",0
2353,5983,"I have been here primarily for lunch, but most recent visit was for dinner.  I have enjoyed this place from the first time I visited.  This is definitely an old school joint.I was waiting for a friend in the bar drinking a tequila and so I ordered the oysters rockefeller.  I have had this dish at many restaurants and I found this version to be right up there with the best.  Before dinner we ordered the caesar salads and they were prepared the old fashioned way, i.e., tableside and in a whimsical way.  For my entree, I ordered the Australian lobster tail and my friend had the shrimp scampi.  We did not leave any food on the table.  The wine selection was good also.  I believe dinner, wine and tip came to $200, but I did not even bat an eye.  I am always satisfied at this placeThe wait staff was very attentive.  I have never had a bad experience at this place.  The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is the location and the need for valet parking.",0
2354,5984,It was an evening after a day at a rodeo and we were hungry for a juicy steak. We arrived and ordered our waiter was great and the steak was delicious. I'll come back again.,1
2355,5985,"Had our 55th Whittier High School dinner on 5/13/2019 with about 21 people......first time at this restaurant and learned it has been in business for 60 years.....great food, excellent service, valet parking.....everything was perfect ...... I can see why they are the top benchmark to beat....5 stars all the way and would give them more if I could!",0
2356,5986,"I went on a whim to try a new restaurant and had a marvelous experience here. The atmosphere was soothing with dim lighting, and tasteful tunes. My waitress Lydia was absolutely exceptional--attentive, considerate, and pleasant service. I ordered the Chicken Parmesan with Spaghetti Marinara and savored every bite. Looking forward to tasting more delightful food next time.",0
2357,5987,Had a very nice lunch here with a few guys for the holidays.  Michelle took care of us and did a fine job.  We didn't have a reservation but called ahead and ask it we could get in. They said come on in.   The place was packed as always.  The service was great.  The apps came out quick and were very good.  We all agreed it was The best shrimp we have all had in a long time.  The pesto bre was tasty also.  The meals took too long to get out but it was busy.  So no worries. We had plenty to talk about.  Once the food came it was all very tasty. The  sea bass was really good but I Would of liked a bigger serving.  The prime rib dip was large and looked great.  Overall this is a really great lunch spot that we visit a few times a year and always enjoy.,0
2358,5988,"Had their 3 course meal on Valentines Day.. their mixed greens salad was SO good! I ordered their jumbo prawns entré, they were stuffed with crabmeat , it was real delicious!! By the time our desserts arrived I was already full, I had the vanilla bean ice cream with berries... very satisfied",0
2359,5989,"This is the 3rd time I've been at the restaurant.  The 1st time was terrific!  The 2nd time was above average.  This last time ... not so good.  The food was good but the server was so inadequate.  We could tell she was new.  The receipt says her name is Mirelle.  We were a party of 7 on 7/8/2019.  When she took our order, we asked for recommendations but she said, ""Everything was good.""  She did not know how to use my camera to take pictures of our group.  I don't understand why servers cannot ask someone else to take the photo if they don't know how to use a camera!I ordered a bucket of steamed clams.  She did not give me a bowl to place the shells.  It took a long time to find someone to give me a bowl.When I asked a busboy, I assumed he did not understand English because he gave me a black styrofoam carton!  Guess he thought I wanted to take the clams home.  Later, I mentioned to the server, Mirelle, that a few clams were not open. She then replied,  ""Oh, do you want me to pry them open?""  I was stunned with her answer!!  Of course not!!  UNOPENED CLAMS ARE NOT EDIBLE!!!  Wait, there's more.  For dessert, we ordered 3 souffles; 2 chocolate and 1 Grand Marnier.  Since they all looked similar, I asked the server which one was the Grand Marnier.  Mirelle then took one of the souffles, turned her back towards us, and poked it with a knife to check!!!   Who does that?!?!  Unbelievable!  We were there for a birthday celebration.  Our bill was almost $500!  With a tip, it was almost $600!!  I was upset that my husband still gave a 20% tip when we all knew the server was incompetent!  He later regretted it too ... but assumes the tips go into a pool whereby it would be divided among all servers.  Hope so because we certainly did not have a good waitress!",1
2360,5990,"Came down for a friends birthday  and had the Chilean sea bass with capers in yellow/white  lemon sauce  Delish but I prefer it served with the  grilled onions topping,  - can't remember the name of that sauce / Davy's?",0
2361,5991,"Puleeze do not show up late and ask for Sonia as your  server , as she is the Best, and we are keeping her quite BUSY!",1
2362,5992,"Oh heck I'm here all the time it seems. Food is always top knotch, I've asked to have scallops prepared differently than the menu w/o a problem. Drinks are  super, always.The main dining room is white table cloths, and the whole place has been updated, although the place still maintains some kinda of mysterious ambience., sort of a 50's Frank Sinatra Vibe. They provide an interesting old school relish dish, I don't know.  Friday nights there's a DJ/singer and a wee place to dance if you've had enough to drink :-D. Lunch time is quite full and surprising because the area is not known for being affluent, and the prices are NOT cheap.  It's been a classic in the area since high school, we see people who've moved to more expensive areas that come here in groups for special celebrations. The owner's a nice guy. Go! Let's.",0
2363,5993,"Came here for dinner. Got food poisoning. My guess is from the oysters. How do I know? Because the other people who came with me did too. And not just the ""gone in a couple hours kind"". Nope. It's been two days of not being able to eat anything. Won't be coming here again. I don't pay great money to get food poisoning.The rest of the food is just ok. I've had better steak at Ruth's Chris, Morton's, etc. They should have more whiskey cocktails for the vibe they have.",0
2364,5994,"Dined inside for lunch. Waitress was excellent. Food was just ok and at their prices it was terribly disappointing. Seared tuna was not fresh n couldn't finish it. Oyster Rockefellers  were the tiniest I've ever seen. Cesar was good. Relish tray was 9bviously leftover from night before. There are at least a dozen better steakhouses within 30 minutes of Dal Rae. Not going back unless I have to. Very, very disappointing experience.",0
2365,5995,"Simply a classic. Like an old steakhouse grandpa would have taken you to. Classic design, attentive staff and the pepper steak (fillet) simply unmatched. Sinatra may walk in any minute",1
2366,5996,"Seriously, the Dal Rae deserves all 5 of these stars. Not just because I love the place for the many years of fond memories and nostalgia. The Dal Rae is an unsuspected gem that still cares about the presentation and the experience. From the relish tray when you are first seated, to the table side Caesar, table side bananas foster, and even the table side prepared baked potato, it's all done with some old school class. I mean, how often does your average server pull out the table scraper to remove crumbs from your table?Experience aside, the food is amazing. Even if it's just my husband and myself, we must have the teriyaki tidbits, ahi sashimi on toast, and baked Brie appetizers. I find it hard not to order the Sea Bass ala Ben; it melts in your mouth. The fillet and flat iron are amazing as well.Just try it, you wont be disappointed.",0
2367,5997,"I've been here a few times now, the most recent being this week for my sisters birthday. I love the atmosphere here. It's just so cool and reminds me of an upscale old school restaurant I would go to if I was living in the Mad Men era.They give you a bread basket and a cold slab of butter as well as assorted veggies on ice.The food here is pretty solid. It's a bit pricy but I came during Dine LA so it was a much better value.The food was good.  We got the pepper steak which was really big and thick. Two people could have easily shared it. The wedge salad (yummy) and the fried zucchini (yum!). The brick sundae for dessert was amazing but the creme brûlée was terrible. Definitely don't get the creme brûlée.I took off a star for the service. Our service (Helga?) was really scatterbrained and all over the place. She barely came to the table. But what upset me is we came for a birthday and we put that in the reservation and I even told her again at the table and they did nothing for my sisters birthday. Not even put a candle on her dessert she ordered. I saw another table with a birthday and they brought out a cake slice with a candle on it for the person. So that was disappointing because we came on her actual birthday and it didn't feel much like a celebration.The food and atmosphere is 4 stars but the service was more like 2 stars.",1
2368,5998,"We wanted to try a new steakhouse and heard about Dal Rae. We made a reservation and arrived a little early. As we arrived the first thing I noticed was their sign. This place takes you back to the mid century modern era. From it's architecture to its decor. Once inside, we were surprised to see how crowded this place was. We didn't realize until we were seated and were given the menu,   that we happened to go on a day they were doing Dine LA.Food: We had 1/2 dozen oysters for our appetizer and tried their featured menu. I chose the wedge salad, pepper steak, and créme brûlée. The food was amazing.Service: From the valet to the server the service was great. Friendly service. Attentive staff. I would definitely recommend it.",1
2369,5999,"The evening begins when you valet your car. Attendants (tonight was Eduardo) are polite and open both doors and take good care of your car. Check in desk employees welcomed us and kept a close eye when a table opened up.  Once again a great dining experience. Seated on time, Ashley our server was tops!!! Had the Escargot to start and couldn't stop eating the garlic even after the Escargot was all gone...Next their famous Pepper Steak Filet cooked to perfection. Oh and don't forget the Cheese Bread... A great bottle of wine, and finished it off with the Gold Brick dessert and a Cappuccino. We will be back again and again.",0
2370,6000,Had Valentine's reservation at 7pm. Busy busy busy. Hadn't been here in a number of years. Didn't get seated until 8pm but it was worth waiting. The place is old school with a mix of young and old. While waiting to be seated we sat in the bar and enjoyed music and some drinks. Bartenders were very busy but stayed attentive to everyone's needs. The staff at check-in   were polite and friendly. Keeping their cool on such a busy night was probably a challenge but they did it. Once seated we had the best booth in the dining room. Heidi was our server and she couldn't have been better. Always there with suggestions ..it was a prefixed menu for Valentine's Day but you couldn't go wrong with any of the items. We had a 20 Oz prime rib and a 14 Oz peppered filet along with baked potatoes vegetables cheesy garlic bread a relish plate and for dessert Creme Brulee and a special ice cream coated chocolate sauce that hardens on it when it touches the ice cream.  All were delicious and even better leftovers for today. 5 Stars for the food drinks staff and management. We will be back.,0
2371,6001,"Went there for dinner out in the patio it was wonderful, the food was so delicious as always. Service is always top notch. This is my family's favorite special occasion spot.",1
2372,6002,"Was finally able to dine here after a bunch of coworkers raved about how good the pepper steak was.  Decided to have dinner with a good friend/coworker after day shift.  Arrived late as there was traffic down Rosemead Blvd.  I ended up valeting my car since I was running late but my buddy parked in an adjacent lot.  Valet charges $3.50 for their service which is reasonable but I still hate dropping off my keys to a stranger.  Once we were seated, they brought out a veggie platter along with some bread.  We then ordered the famous Dal Rae caesar salad which is prepared table side (yelp.com/biz_photos/YRYo…).  I'll have to admit this was a pretty damn good caesar salad as the dressing was light and had the perfect balance of dressing to romaine lettuce (yelp.com/biz_photos/YRYo…).  The coddled egg added a nice creamy texture to the dressing and the table side preparation was definitely cool.  The waitress also brought out fresh garlic cheese bread which was hella good.  Of course I ended up ordering the filet mignon pepper steak (yelp.com/biz_photos/YRYo…).  Ordered it rare and was brought out more of a medium-rare steak but was hungry and ended up not sending it back.  The flavor of the steak more than compensated for the fact that the steak was overcooked, it really was that good.  The filet was served with some string beans and opted for their baked potato with butter, sour cream, and cheese sauce (yelp.com/biz_photos/YRYo…).  I'll have to admit the cheese sauce made an ordinary baked potato taste hella good.  Would've been awesome if they offered bacon bits.I still prefer my steaks seasoned with just sea salt and pepper but will be back for some more pepper steak!",0
2373,6003,"Dal Rae was an underwhelming steakhouse experience. Based on all the high remarks via Yelp and friends saying they have ""bomb pepper steak,"" I thought it was time to make an appearance. Fortunately, they were one of the many participants in dineLA so we decided to give it a try. Not sure if it's always packed on a weekday or if it was because of dineLA but it was a full house on a Tuesday night. It seems like this joint attracts a lot of older people. I felt all sorts of out of place.Baked Scallops -- THE best part of the meal. I'd come back just for this! Juicy scallops baked in a cheese sauce, served on a half shell. Personally, I think the cheese gave it enough flavor that it didn't need the horseradish or hollandaise sauce. Talk about beefy scallops!Veal Marsala -- Thin cuts of veal served in a marsala and shiitake mushroom sauce. Enjoyed the veal itself as it was super tender and thinly cut but the sauce was heavily flavored with salt, I couldn't entirely enjoy the dang thing. It came with steamed broccoli which had absolutely no flavor. I made do with what I had and dipped the broccoli in the marsala sauce. Wasn't too impressed overall, I left more than half on my plate and decided against taking it home.Creme Brulee -- Mushy custard topped with one raspberry. Though it tasted and smelled okay, the texture seemed wonky.We saw the water boy more than our waitress. We seriously thought she took a break and forgot to tell us. Service was disappointing but I'll just chalk it up to it being a busy night.I did sample their infamous pepper steak. If you're into overly salted steak, then this is your place!",0
2374,6004,"Never been here, before this past Saturday.It took us 1.40 to get there! My Brother in Law Wanted to go there for his BD.We got there early. We were greeted and asked to wait in the bar. From that point on it was A MA ZING.The service was outstanding. The food was incredible. I thought this was an average little neighborhood steak house, was I wrong.  Were there at 5:15, by the the time our dinner came it was packed.They had live entertainment in the Bar! And he was great!Thank you Hilga, our server. You were great. I would come back, except I would have a car service take us! That way I can nap on the way home!  Great job guys!",0
2375,6005,"Came here last night.. I must say  this place never lets me down EVERY TIME I COME HERE! See all pic.. !Last night we celebrated my moms bday. She was impressed! The food, service, place, and just EVERYTHING was perfect!We ordered the Scallops (pix posted)..Sooo juicy, fresh, full of flavor and let me add..SOFT!!The Caeser Salad made by ""Mr. Salad"" was Perfect (btw we took out the anchovy this time) = agn..Perfect! BTW You have to eat as much as you can of their Cheese Bread! I can NEVER get enough! Soo DELISH!My mom and I got the Sea Bass cooked PERFECTLY, not too dry, not under..JUST RIGHT! Darn JUICY!We all had a great time. ^_^ The server was sweet! The food AWESOME.. Cant wait for another special day to come so I can COME BACK!!thanx Dal Rae!",0
2376,6006,"A little style and a dash of class in a land of strip malls, chain restaurants that all seem the same, and fast food joints.Don't get me wrongs, I enjoy the greasy burger and IHOP pancakes, but sometimes you need an old school dining experience.We went here on New Years Eve.  Good choice.  Service was excellent and food was even better.  Old school charm, good drinks in the bar, good wine list, live music, and even the old sign still out front.And when the waitress informed us there was no relish tray that night, and she could tell we had been there before, she went into the kitchen and created 2 ""relish bowls"" for us.So why not 5 stars? well, the entree's on the NYE menu were all over $60.  I was expecting that.  But there was no champagne included.  I was not expecting that.  With 2 rounds of drinks in the bar while waiting to be seated, dinner for 6, and wine with dinner, as well as soup/salad (not included in the $60 entrees) our bill was pretty hefty.  So would a glass of decent champagne been too much to ask?Other than that? perfect evening.",0
2377,6007,"***Dal Rae is a classic, throwback restaurant and their kitchen is definitely utilizing high quality ingredients to deliver satisfying though maybe not excellent and definitely pricey plates of food***Dal Rae is a retro, throwback restaurant that has a Mad Men-like feel inside and out.  Dal Rae's exterior echoes an earlier era, but the ownership has done a good job maintaining the restaurant; it is well kept and does not feel old or rundown.  The interior is dark with plush booths and a masculine feel.The menu is throwback too with savory options like Oyster Rockefeller and veal marsala as well as table side preparations such as Steak Diane and cherries jubilee.  Dal Rae's dinner menu is pricey and so is their lunch menu though lunch features some lower priced entrees as well as smaller portions.To start, I had their crab cakes.  I liked how they utilized a light breaded exterior and the crab was very good and fresh.  Unfortunately, there was a lot of filler in the crab cake and it was mostly bread crumbs, which made the dominant taste here soggy bread.  The cream sauce was okay, but did not provide the heat I was hoping for.yelp.com/biz_photos/dal-…My entree was better though.  I had their signature pepper steak.  You can have the pepper steak in one of three ways--a New York Strip, a filet mignon or a ground beef patty.  I opted for the New York Strip.  I requested the steak medium rare and, unfortunately, it was served medium (almost medium well).  It was a testament to the quality of the beef they were using that the steak was so juicy.  Despite the steak being only slightly pink and being a New York Strip, which is a leaner cut, the steak was still tender and juicy.yelp.com/biz_photos/dal-…I did not like the seasoning though I guess the strong and even overpowering pepper taste was to be expected given its name.  There was also an abundance of green onions, which definitely left a strong taste in my mouth.  I did like the use of bacon; it was nicely cooked as the fat was rendered down and a crispiness was achieved, but there was also a nice chew to the bacon.The steak came with creamy and good mashed potatoes as well as asparagus.  Mashed potatoes and asparagus were served with most entrees here, but the kitchen definitely did a good job making these sides enjoyable and not just feeling like throwaway sides or afterthoughts.I was happy to find out they offer their chocolate souffle at lunch so I went with it.  The souffle was nicely done.  It had a good lightly crisp edge and a warm, moist and liquidy center without being runny or under-baked.  They served the chocolate souffle with an airy whipped cream and a chocolate sauce.  I would have preferred creme anglaise, vanilla ice cream or even maybe just a thicker schlag-like whipped cream.yelp.com/biz_photos/dal-…Service was good--friendly and quick.Prices are too high.  The kitchen utilizes high quality ingredients, but I felt the food was overpriced given you can find more interesting, more modern as well as more delicious variations of these popular dishes in other Los Angeles area restaurants.Dal Rae is a throwback restaurant, but I was pleased to find out their food is not too old-fashioned or out of style.  There are definitely several good things about Dal Rae (the quality of ingredients, the good service, the chocolate souffle) and I think it is a good (albeit expensive) option if you are seeking a retro dining experience but still want a good and satisfying dinner.Street parking is not really available close to Dal Rae.  Dal Rae offers valet parking and it is $4.50 at lunch.",1
2378,6008,"Excellent food and excellent service on top of a great atmosphere. The drinks were strong and the food was fresh and of good quality. Marie was our server, she explained the menu and provided us with excellent customer service. The in bone rib eye was cooked to perfection and the seabass was the best we ever tasted.  The sides were served hot and full of flavor.  The hot bread and radish tray appetizer was delicious and fresh. Eating at the Dal Rae was a great experience.",0

2381,6011,This place is absolutely amazingI've been wanting to try this restaurant for a few years. My husband and I finally tried it today. I will start by saying the staff is exceptional when it comes to customers service. Which is a dying are. We were seated emedialy.Our waitress was Gabriella she went above and beyond I mentioned once that I couldn't have cheese and she remembered I couldn't have daily with everything we ordered I am very greatful.Our glass was always full of our beverage we never had to ask for anything she was always one step ahead of us.FoodI had the Chilean sea bass it was fresh and perfectly prepared..so deliciousMy husband had the chicken Monterey with the mashed potatoes also delicious the mashed potatoes looked like clouds and they taste amazing light airy and smooth. This was the best food we've had in California.The excellent customer service continued through the entire time.Recommend this place 100% We will be backAlso try the souffle you will not be disappointed,0
2382,6012,Wow! Pretty impressive. Had the halibut with Allá Ban sauce. Omg. It was excellent. Then creme berle for dessert and bananas foster. So good.,0
2383,6013,"I have lived by this place for about 2 years and this was my first time going and let me say WOW. The martinis were ridiculously good and the food was delish. Definitely enjoyed the Cesar salad which is a del Rae special, we had the tomahawk and the lamb chops which were both tasty. The cheesy bread was also a tasty surprise.",0
2384,6014,"I had a business meeting lunch to attend so I choose the Dal Rae. Yeah it's a old school steakhouse that's been around since the 50's but its still classy and the food is upscale compared to what's in the area.We didn't have reservations and were seated at a booth. We started off with ice tea and I chose the Baseball Sandwich at $13.95 turkey, prime rib, corned beef, Ortega Chile, jack cheese, hot mustard and thousand island dressing on pumpernickel Bread.I went with the potato salad as my side. When my entree arrived it was three sliced sandwiches piled high. I could barely get my mouth over the sandwich.Overall a good qualtiy meal with stellar service which made my two hour business meeting  a success. FYI they valet only and that will set you back $3.50 plus gratuity.",0
2385,6015,"Old school service with a maitre de that serves bananas flambé table side. Anyway, I digress. There is usually someone playing piano and singing in the bar which is classy. Again, I digress.Fine linens and low lighting set the mood. Big menu of surf and turf. Had the Chilean sea bass. Cooked to perfection with a Parmesan crust and light lemon butter sauce.  Had the lobster bisque to start.  So good. Tip*- Do not load up on the bread and relish tray as you will not have enough room for your entree. Anyway, this restaurant was busy but the sounds from nearby tables was muffled due to great acoustic ceilings. It can feel very intimate even though it is a spacious place.We didn't order dessert this time around but I have had their creme brûlée and it is perfection.",1
2386,6016,Best meal I've ever had. The interior is like a time capsule- but it just adds to the charm. Highly recommend this place,1
2387,6017,"Stepping into Dal Rae, I felt like I had taken a time machine back to mid-century America. With slick leather booths, moody lighting a full bar and art deco light fixtures and wallpaper, I felt like I could be eating steak next to the likes of Don Draper, Lucille Ball or Frank Sinatra. The atmosphere is nostalgic yet casual enough for a group dinner and jeans. With live music and a full bar, it feels lively, though it's certainly for an older crowd.The food is alright. The quality of the meat is top-notch, but I felt it all lacked seasoning. I had the petite filet with their signature peppercorn sauce. The steak itself was thick and huge for a petite cut, cooked to a perfect medium as ordered. However, I felt the peppercorn sauce was vastly disappointing. With the heaping pile of green onions and crushed peppercorns, it was aromatic and I was sure I was in for a treat. But, to my dismay, it was all bland. I had to add salt and to no avail. The asparagus was equally bland and more thick and fibrous than I prefer. To their credit, the garlic mashed potatoes were savory. Appetizers were good, not exceptional, but good. The calamari was cooked well and I loved their cocktail sauce. The oysters Rockafeller were tasty, but after being piled high with bacon, spinach and cheese, I couldn't even taste the oyster anymore. Perhaps just a personal preference, but I'd rather have an oyster on the half-shell. The baked brie was melty and delicious with Tuscan flavors and fresh bread--probably one of my favorites. Be sure to save room for dessert, because their chocolate soufflé and crème brulee are incredible! Overall, for the price, I'd say everything was marginally acceptable. Good for the meat and potato lover, probably subpar for the avid foodie.Service is hit or miss. Our waitress that night, Jackie, was awesome! Attentive with a positive attitude, she refilled our drinks diligently. Other staff members, not so much. We asked for some clean wine glasses and were denied and told all the wine glasses in the restaurant were in use. We were appalled not only by her attitude, but by the fact that a restaurant of this caliber would have a shortage of wine glasses on a Friday night. Really?Tip: Valet parking is only $4. Compared to where I'm from, that's a steal!",0

2389,6019,"I went for lunch on Thursday. The service was impeccable - as was the food. On Thursdays and Fridays, the prime rib is available for lunch as well as dinner. It was heaven. I has lobster bisque as my appetizer and it was buttery and flavorful. The place was buzzing at 1pm and it was filled with business people. Heads up - only valet parking available but it is affordable.",0
2390,6020,"My family has been coming here since the 1970's. This place has a top shelf ambience as well as a classic and refined  approach to customer service. Think Goodfellas meets Epicurus sanctuary.  The Ahi Sashimi toast crunches into your mouth then melts down your throat. The oysters Rockefeller with Tapatio sauce is just indelible. Don't think, just go to experience the gold standard for yourself",1
2391,6021,The atmosphere is classy cozy.  Old time white table clothes with dark gleaming booths.   You get an icy relish tray to star and the steaks are awesome.   I highly recommend the table side Caesar salad- perfect!!,0

2395,6025,"Heard from owner after my last review. Three of the eight people in our dinner party have been contacted and promised that they want to make it up to us after the way our previous night ended.  Thankful for call, and will give them that chance",0
2396,6026,"Had a group of eight enjoying our meal ,  had just finished paying our bill and were enjoying a cup of coffee, when we noticed a group of people staring, and making faces in the background. When we asked them what was up, they drunkenly made it clear that they were waiting  for our table. Next thing one of them pulls up a chair and makes it clear she is not moving  until we do. She acts real nice and then says we just want you the fuck off our table because we are waiting. Made it real uncomfortable, with the manager and the hostess just watching and doing nothing to stop them. After spending a thousand dollars on a meal, the taste that was left in our mouths, changed the whole experience. We were not abusing our time, and even had people sitting behind us express how rude and uncomfortable this made them. Don't understand why anybody from the restaurant did not stop them, instead saw them and said nothing. Was first time we were ever there.   Would not go back after how the night ended. Staff should have stepped in, and let us finish our very expensive meal, like we were entitled to.Don't have a problem spending money on a nice meal, but part of what you pay for is the whole experi we nce, not just the food. Seriously would consider this review this  before patronizing this restaurant.",0
2397,6027,"My first time in Pico Rivera was a success, as it involved a visit to Dal Rae.  Nice place to have a company-sponsored event, or to have a meal.  Staff is friendly and accommodating.  Parking is limited to valet only.  They have a horseshoe-shaped bar with many options.  I came here for a business luncheon that was held in the back room, so it was private, after our cocktail hour near the bar.  The private room with double doors held about 60 guests with round tables set up.  Service was prompt and I had their chicken piccata dish, which came with [large] asparagus pieces and mashed potatoes.  The chicken was very tender and juicy, and a large serving, compared to the other options of swordfish or steak medallions.  Their passed appetizers of caprese bruschetta and meatballs were outstanding - both were large helpings (more than one bite apps).  I believe beers were charged as $7.95, so you have an idea of what other beverages may cost.From what I've heard, the Dal Rae has been around for 55 years and was the ""it"" place for fine dining. and they've only had one or two renovations since its opening.  This place has a vintage-modern feel - there is one area of patio seating that seems like a ""smoking room"", where the open area is enclosed so minimal light gets in and you leave that room smelling like a chimney.  The clientele during my visit was older - much older, as if they have been coming here since their 20s or 30s, and the staff is familiar and warm with these guests. The staff is also older, but they are seasoned, knowledgeable and friendly.  I observed the bartender make almost a dozen old-fashioned drinks here (this was at 1pm!).. they must be good.",0
2398,6028,"Thank you to my wife and our server Mary Jane for a wonderful birthday dinner. We couldn't believe how busy the place was and I'm glad my wife made a reservation because the table was waiting for us. The prime rib regular cut was great for me. The large cut of filet mignon was similar in size to an 8oz cooked steak, which was the perfect size for my wife.",1
2399,6029,"I was very much satisfied with the amount of work the servers and management staff do at this place. They make your Caesar salad at the table. They fluff your baked potatoes and dress them up with butter, sour cream and chives. They sliced our Tomahawks to share. We got the baked Brie with Garlic & pesto which was amazing! The fries were a bit soggy so that was the only thing that was disappointing. But overall, wonderful service and great food.",0
2400,6030,"A chance to travel back in time and experience a classic 50s decor featuring amazing cow? They made me an offer I couldn't refuse.My friends have been wanting to come here for a while. I was expecting great meat and a nostalgic, old school decor.Upon walking in, I was a bit disappointed. The supposed old school bar has apparently been remodeled. I didn't get to experience the ""transported back in time"" feeling that so many others have enjoyed. Maybe it's because of the holidays, or perhaps because of renovations, but I did not feel a 50s blast from the past vibe at all. The main dining room was filled with Christmas decorations. The interior was nice, don't get me wrong. It was very classy, just more modern and Christmasy than Rat Pack-esque.According to yelp hours, the restaurant closes for an hour gap then reopens for dinner. However, when I called to make a reservation, the lady said it doesn't close. What's funny is even their own hours posted in the restaurant says it closes for two hours between 3 and 5. Confusing, to say the least.I like that the food item menu is all on one page so you don't have to go flipping back-and-forth a lot. I was on the fence between the famous pepper steaks (filet or New York), 20 oz bone in ribeye, and prime rib. I recently had the 22 oz bone in at Mastro's. I was craving prime rib because they were out of it at Original Roadhouse Grill so I was forced to order a New York there. So my decision was already made. As far as prime rib I was torn between regular cut for its medium rare doneness versus the end cut for its well seasoned crispiness. Our server Monica said she'd save me an end cut while I pondered. Ultimately I chose a regular cut in order to enjoy medium rare.The prime rib was thick; it seemed like one inch. It was juicy, moist, well seasoned, and scrumptious. I enjoyed every single bite. I was very happy with the decision to get regular cut, although I assume the end cut would have been great too. (I'll have to come back to find out, ha ha.) My entree came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. They were both good.My buddy got the New York steak. I had a few bites and it was pretty good. Cooked perfectly medium rare, and also one inch thick. My other friend got the filet mignon pepper steak, and he said it was good.The meal also came with complimentary bread and a relish tray.Valet is $4.50. Not sure if it's valet only. I didn't bother to venture out further into the parking lots of neighboring businesses to find out.We had a 5:00 reservation and it was pretty slow. To our surprise, by the time we were leaving the dining room was full. This must be a pretty popular place amongst the older clientele. I felt a bit out of place based on my age. I was definitely the youngest person in the room.They might want to consider working on the spacing between tables. We were in one of the booths along the side of the wall, and people constantly had to wiggle their way by because another table was so close to us. When I stood up to use the restroom, I had to weave my way in and out.I can eat sushi alone, and usually steak also. But Dal Rae is definitely not a place I would come alone. It's hard to explain. I felt comfortable alone at Mastro's, but for some reason Dal Rae seems much more conducive to having company. The atmosphere is a little more casual and relaxed. Mastro's in comparison is more fine dining and serious. I wore the same type of outfit to both; I felt underdressed at Mastro's and overdressed at Dal Rae.At the end of the meal I asked Monica, ""you saved me that end cut right?"" She laughed immediately, even though I kept a straight face and was as serious as possible. She's good.I'd come back to try different cow. Knowing now that the decor is not what it used to be, I'll just look forward to the meat coma.",1
2401,6031,"Let me start by saying that my review is specifically for a tall reddish blonde jerk who seemed to be the Maitre De.The jerk was going around to each table saying hello and asking them about their dining experience. We were the only Hispanics in the dining room at that time. He approached our table when I had taken my daughter to the restroom. He approached the table and asked my husband  if the bill had scared his family away. When I returned, I felt him staring at our table from a distance, as if keeping an eye an us. I asked my husband if he too noticed it and then he told me of his comment. Luckily for him my husband is not confrontational.I left a great tip for the waitress who was just amazing and sweet. I was so excited to dine there but I will not return.If you decide to go there, make sure you look wealthy and non-Hispanic to ensure you don't get the special treatment that idiot gave us. It's Unfortunate that his comment clouded our entire experience.",0

2403,6033,"Great food, on the expensive side but F$&! It you only live once so make it a good one.",1
2404,6034,And the food and the service will never disappoint the mini for made pepper steak is just right alongside the garlic mashed potatoes! And old-school steakhouse in the city you would never imagine to find one. They had great music at the bar not too loud but yet inviting enough for you to stay for one more drink after a great dinner! If you are not a big eater stick to just your plate because the portions are pretty big! Enough to share for 3!,0
2405,6035,They are doing a great job in view of all the rules and regs. Lorin has done everything to make dining a real wonderful expierance. Honestly you can't order a bad dish. Service was perfect. We were so glad to have the pleasure of the Dal Rae expierance again. Our advice just go and you'll see. The history and the quality is all there and it is truly at the top of our list for fine dining. We love so many things served there that the list would never stop. Lorin thank you for all your diligence in maintaining a place that we have gone to for over 45 years. Your dad would be and is proud of you. Both Bill and Ben treated my family like friends and special guests. As they did everyone. Lorin in that same tradition is hands on walking from table to table making sure you're expierance is the best. AMEN!!,0
2406,6036,"First time here and the last. Service was slow. The large lobster @ market price looked good, in reality it was overcooked and dry. The regular sized prime rib and creme brulee made the meal bearable...maybe this place is more suited for people who don't mind spending lots of cash on almost tasteless food. I could've gone to In-N-Out, paid barely a fraction of what did at Del Rae AND enjoyed all of my food. Plus, I think my sister got food poisoning, because she spent the better part of the night in the restroom.",0
2407,6037,"Treated like a VIP.   Just wondered where my presidential motorcade was.The moment I arrived, I was pampered from the valet person to the waiter and to the Cook.Immediately, my car was was whisked away  (Hope he works here).Quickly escorted inside by a worker holding the door opened for me, receiving an instant warm welcome from the hostess.But...as I was seated, a large loud group was next to me.  I asked for a  quieter seating area and chose the bar area.Once I entered this area, it was totally quiet.  A couple that was there just was leaving .  The two men bickering at the bar wobbled away.There I sat all by myself, so quiet...I could hear a pin drop.  Just the way i liked it.The kind waiter from behind the bar approached and brought my soda..(yup a soda).  Complimentary bread was nice and fresh with lots of butter.But spoiled as I am, I craved a rib eye steak for lunch (I guess it's usually for din din) but i did express my thoughts to the waiter for rib eye steak.The accommodating chef agreed to my requests and cooked a magnificent bone in rib eye steak so exquisitely delicious.  Slightly skimpy on the mashed yet a little pricy for the rib eye steak, I felt it warranted the five stars for the way I was pampered.   Definitely worth a second and third visit and love the old look of the  establishment.",0
2408,6038,"I have been brought here by others several times over the years. Never liked this place or ever been a fan. This place is way overrated! Service is always slow and not very personal. They seem to always squeeze too many people into the restaurant like sardines just to make as much money as possible. You will always get bumped into by the servers as they walk by while you are eating.On at least two occasions we had food spilt on someone in our party while bringing food out to the tables by the servers. If you don't wear fine and expensive clothing I guess it's ok. But we usually wear our Sunday best to a steakhouse and it just ruins the meal when you have butter, sour cream or oil spill on your clothes. And then act like it's no big deal and they try to clean it with soda water. Really.They are know for their Chilean sea bass and peppered steak. I have tried both on several occasions. It's never consistent. Sometimes dry and over-cooked or under-cooked. Consistently inconsistent. The food is not all that and very expensive. Corkage fee is $25. Too expensive for this place.Location is Pico Rivera...really? You'll sometimes get seated in a patio or even in a room in the back where your servers will undoubtably forget you are there. At dinner last night it took 1hour and 45 minutes to see bread come to our table. 2 hours to get the main dish. Ridiculous. After 3 and half hours, the bill was $225 per couple before tip. And we brought our own wine.The menu was prefix at $80 a person. My filet was burnt and tough when I ordered it medium. I was too hungry to send it back and took a couple bites and left the rest. The baked potato wasn't even a good quality. Overrated!!!",1
2409,6039,"Do the Voodoo Magic you done did...Jiminy Crickets Rocket Sauce Steakhouse.The ambiance is dark, stealthy and exceedingly busy.  The space is not contrained by temporal dimensions.  Exist and thrive in a setting that transcends.  Rest your prejudices at the door.Then try the Fried Rock Shrimp with Hot Sweet and Sour Sauce.  Addictive little bites of crusty crustaceans.Pair it with the Baked Scallops Cava de Oro with fresh scallops in a cheese sauce with horseradish and hollandaise sauce. Velvety cheese meet tender mollusks. How YOU doin'?Along with the not-to-be-missed Baked Brie with Elephant Roasted Garlic prepared with pesto, pine nuts, sundried tomatoes, served with crostini.  I am going to have a coronary thrombosis and LIKE it - strike that, LOVE it.Don't be surprised by the Sprouted Brown Rice served as a side and are intended to defibrillate your heart as necessary.  Must not die today.I do not know who Alla is, but his Chilean Sea Bass Alla Ben is seabassallabenilicious.The behemoth-like Prime New York Pepper Steak prepared with what appears to be bacon, scallions and a pile of pepper was unique, and the textures and flavors worked.  An edible tapestry.Furthermore, I must extrapolate the nature of the Cottage Fried Potatoes with onions and jalapenos because life is too short.  These potatoes are interestingly similar in presentation to potatoes au gratin, but without the cheese.  Thoroughly exceptional.For dinner, please do not miss the Gold Brick Sundae served in a lace cookie.  Now this lace cookie is a dream.  Delightfully creamy ice cream is embraced by a burly cookie embellished with what I imagine are nuts and toffee as I could not differentiate a thing in the darkness. Judgment be gone.The least spectacular and underwhelming was the Chocolate Souffle with chocolate sauce and whipped cream.",0
2410,6040,"While the food was pretty delicious, the service was sub par:1. I ordered a bruised martini with two olives, my cousin ordered a dirty martini-- neither of us got our martinis as ordered.2. Ordered the table side Caesar- it wasn't prepared table side at all. It was brought out to us. Then when server asked my cousin if she wanted pepper, my cousin said, ""No thank you,"" yet the server continued to put pepper on the salad. She did bring another one out 5 minutes later.3. I ordered a glass of Rodney Strong Meritage- was given Merlot.4. Table was not serviced using formal dining etiquette (this will sound picky, but I'm a former fine dining server): plates were not cleared entirely between courses, table wasn't crumbed between courses, drinks and plates were handed and auctioned out, spoons were dumped on table with shared dessert.5. Server assumed change was her tip, and did not return it with our check.When you go out to eat at a restaurant like Dal Rae, you expect a certain level of service that was not provided by our server.",0
2411,6041,My first time there on Sunday and I was in awe of the old school vibe that it had. Which I loved!! The food was full of flavor and just amazing from the appetizer to the deserts!! It is pricey but so worth it. I heard it looks amazing around the holidays so that is when I will come back!!,0
2412,6042,Best meal we've had in a LONG LONG time!! Their Sea Bass (cooked their way) is the bomb!! Their banana flambé is beyond my wildest dreams!  And you get the handsome owner who does the Caesar Salad and Banana Flambé right at your table!  Attentive wait & service staff. The old world charm of the place made me wonder if we were in for a show from a Sinatra Imitate.... Open since 1958(!) Thank You so much for keeping this Gem alive!,0
2413,6043,"Just a fantastic place.  The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  The food portions are huge and delicious.  Classy ""old school"" feel!  Great spot!Always great for s special occasion or a business meeting.  I have yet to be disappointed with the food and service.",0
2414,6044,Pretty delicous food. Very elegant. Tables are a little close to one another but other than that I love this restaurant,1
2415,6045,Had such a lovely experience! Michelle was great and the atmosphere was perfect. Definitely coming back for some more chicken parm !!,1
2416,6046,"it was Chilean sea bass...  not sure what i was thinking, brain fart i guess. Either way still a 5 star rating! If you haven't been yet then hurry n go. You wont be sorry.",1
2417,6047,"I LOVE it here! The food was out of this world delicious! They had a great wine selection and the service was amazing. Anyone coming here has to try the Chilean halibut, its to die for!",0
2418,6048,"Let's see, where to start... let's start with the crappy valet in the front. I waited and waited in the street for them to pull our other vehicle forward for several minutes. I was in the street waiting a good five minutes for them to pull the other cars forward in order to have enough room to clear the street.  While I was waiting mid street mid driveway, two other vehicles entered from the exit lane and were assisted immediately. The customers should be helped in the order they arrive, not whatever order they ended up in because they decided to cut in front of the other vehicles. Once I was finally able to pull up, there was no one in sight to open my door or leave the key with.... so please explain the purpose of a valet if he isn't there to assist customers as they arrive... I walked in and relayed my experience to the hostess while being taken back to our seats. I asked for the manager, but several minutes passed by and he didn't come out until I asked our server to grab him. I shouldn't have had to ask twice for a manager to address my concerns about the valet. My request going unanswered just ticked me off even more than the valet did. Our orders were finally taken and the food came out, but everything seemed so terribly slow. Every single thing took foreverrrrr!!!! All in all we were there nearly three hours. On the plus side our orders were accurate. The food was decent, and from what I know, our steaks were all cooked correctly. I didn't care much for their sauces, but perhaps that's just personal preference.  When we were done with our entrees it took a very long time to be brought dessert menus, it took so long that none of us wanted dessert by the time they arrived. The manager did send out a complimentary dessert as an apology for the poor valet service, but we had multiple cars that all experienced the same issue of not being able to pull forward and other cars being helped first that arrived after us.... one dessert for a large table is a pretty pathetic apology. I enjoyed my meal, but I didn't enjoy the painfully slow service and will definitely not be rushing back to dine here any time soon. The three stars is basically for my steak.... Everything else was closer to a two star rating. =\",0
2419,6049,"My first time at this restaurant for dinner with some coworkers. The atmosphere seemed nice and cozy, a little too dark for me but it was ok. We ordered some drinks which came out late due to the reason that I believe they were understaffed. Dinner was ok, didn't have much flavor to the food. Our waitress had  extreme attitude and very sarcastic. I won't go back to this restaurant, it's overpriced for the quality of food. There are many restaurants I can spend my money for better service and food. I Don't recommend it at alll!",0
2420,6050,"Great old-school restaurant that has been here since the 40s. Classic vibe of a traditional Steakhouse. All of our food was excellent prepared correctly, seasoned perfectly and served with a traditional home style feel. The staff went out of their way to make sure everything was on point. Second time here and we'll be coming back time and time again. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the LA area.",0
2421,6051,"Nice restaurant,  came for a drink, and overall good place...however some of the staff seems unpleasant not sure why? Be careful towards the end of the night and service.......addressed it to manager and he seemed to dismiss my issues with waitress rude and condescending tone",1
2422,6052,"Dinner for four Sunday night, started with Bombay Sapphire Gin Martinis in bar (no piano on Sundays unfortunately). House was packed when we were seated in our booth for dinner 6:45pm. Very tasty Caesar salad prepared by Ken at table side. I had an excellent Wagu flat iron steak that was buttery and very tasty. We finished a very enjoyable meal with Cherries Jubilee prepared at the table. An enjoyable 50's/60's dinner throwback in Pico Rivera, not exactly a destination spot, but more than worth it if you are in the area.",0
2423,6053,"I've been here plenty of times in the PAST & had the salad with baked potato which is good. Unfortunately our waitress told us our baked Potato was beening microwave (I dont use a microwave 2 thumbs down) and wouldn't make on time our meal & offered us mash (OK) our plates come out & with the ORINGAL potato  Yeayee uhh Aww silence no it was dry had the radiation of the microwave taste was really off so I put a fork in mine rest in peace!! Perhaps it was me & it's me ,service is always great & I'd go back for cocktails only.",0
2424,6054,I got my favorite restaurant back! My last review must have been a very off night for some reason. We've been back several times since that last review but I didn't want to update prematurely. I can say with confidence now that Dal Rae is the same place I know and love and still the same great quality. In fact we already have reservations for our next visit. The prime rib and filet have been perfect each time (my favorites) and consistently delicious. I'm happy my last review was just a bad night and the Dal Rae is back to being superb! Yay!,0
2425,6055,"Wow, what happened? We've been back several times since our last review and I think I mentioned I have been coming here for decades. Last night (2/22/19) everything from the kitchen was WRONG. As usual, the service was great, but all of our favorite dishes were way below Dal Rae standards. I wish I would've taken a picture of the traditional yet pathetic relish tray last night. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 2 carrot sticks, 2 celery sticks and 2 shriveled slices of cucumber or whatever those green things were. I excused it. Maybe someone new in the kitchen threw it together? Then when the cheese toast came out there was no taste of cheese or anything edible. Only an oily taste that was very off. I had to mention that to the waitress. Later she told us that staff in the kitchen have different opinions as to how it should be made. Seriously, after decades doing it right, one person can change it?Then there's our main meal. The petite filet was wonderful. But 2 of us decided to share our two favorite dishes - the small lobster tail for ($82) and the large bone in Prime Rib ordered medium (so still pink). Our dishes came and we cut those two favorites in half to share them and started eating (too late to send back now). We notice the prime rib is tough and after eating in the dim light that there is no pink at all (you prime rib lovers know  this is important), but worse yet that it's not tender as usual.So, for over $300++ for 3 of us I'd like to know what happened to my dear Dal Rae - (that's not counting the money we spent in the bar with the woman bartender again with an attitude). Has it changed hands after all these years? There was no sign of the brothers either, though the salad guy was there and made the excellent Caesar (though not table side as usual- in the aisle). I'm giving 2 stars for the service and the filet and would like to know why most everything from the kitchen was subpar. As you can see from my previous reviews on here and Open Table, last night was not the Dal Rae I know and love.",0
2426,6056,"Yes, it's pricey but for good reason.  Everything is top-notch.  The food is the highest quality you will find anywhere.   Drive to Beverly Hills or Pasadena, but you'll pay for the neighborhood.  Here you pay for quality, service and ambiance. No attitudes here. They are happy to serve you and make sure you are 100% satisfied. As a side note:  I've never had a bigger or better lobster tail anywhere at any price. And I've only ordered the small one!  The large one is twice the size of the small, so you can imagine how enormous it is.  There is nothing on their menu that isn't superb and our waitress Lydia was on it.  She didn't skip a beat and made sure we had everything we needed.  Perfect!",0
2427,6057,"I really wanted to love this place. My honey and his family have probably been coming here for over 2 decades. It's a very classic American restaurant. Valet parking is 4.50 and it's a fancier place to go. We made reservations for 8pm on Wednesday night and it was packed!The ambiance was very moody. But there wasn't any music playing.Our service took quite some time before we had our drink order taken or till we even got some bread on our table.My bf was very excited to bring me here since it's been a family tradition. But I hate to say the bread bowl and relish plate was my favorite part.The crispy bread chip was my favoriteWe also started off with the fried rock shrimp which tasted like something out of Panda Express. Heavily breaded and drowned in sweet & sour chili paste sauce.We both ordered the peppered steak filet with French fries on the side.I was very unimpressed with my filet, the actual meat and sauce was so bland. If there wasn't any bacon in the sauce it would've had no taste. And the French fries (we got the shoestring) were nothing special probably frozen.Once we finally got our server (Liz) she paid lots of attention to us and was wonderful and very sweetShe even brought out a complimentary slice of cake  for what we were celebrating.I won't ever crave this restaurant but I'm sure I'll be back with my bfs family and I won't mind it but unfortunately I don't know why they love it so much.",1
2428,6058,"My husband surprised me with dinner at Del Rae for my birthday. I must say I loved it! The food was great, the wine selection nice, and our waitress was fantastic! She really knew the menu and offered great suggestions. I had the prime sirloin with garlic mashed potatoes, which was delish. They served what is possibly the best French onion soup I've ever had! We'll definitely be going back! Thank you for making my birthday extra special :)",0
2429,6059,"This restaurant is one of the few restaurants l will drive close to an hour East to visit.  It's like a giant Dan Tana's on steroids, but with better food. A giant bar area with ton's of table seating is a blast on Fridays with music, but let's talk food because that's the standout.I have never had a bad meal here. Giant shrimp cocktails and sashimi appetizers are standouts, as is the Caesar salads, with...or without garlic if you like (they let me sub horseradish for garlic). The steaks are outstanding and always cooked perfect. The huge veal chop is a knockout and l love the veal and chicken parm. Great pasta. And.. don't forget the real deal delicious soufles for desert. Big drinks and great table service (some of the best waitresses and bussers l have ever encountered anywhere) complete the deal for me.

I will admit that I felt nervous when going in, especially since I noticed that it was a bit pricey. The price is worth though every penny though, because everything was spectacular! The atmosphere is very romantic, the food is spectacular and the servers are wonderful! They were all attentive and made us feel important. As we left the restaurant, my wife shared with me that she felt like a queen. Thank you for making it a very memorable occasion for her!",0

Got the Stags Cab which they sell by the glass.  Great wine list too.  I usually get the king crab claws for appetizer, which is consistently fresh.  Caesar salad table-side  is good.  Table -side banana foster flambé for dessert.  I haven't found a comparable steak house nearby, and this place saves me a trip to the Westside.",0

While our table server was excellent for our party of 6, we had a bad experience in the bar. We arrived before our 5pm reservation and went to the bar to wait.

What difference does it make if we're spending money.",1

2439,6069,"Our first time at the Dal Rae started off rocky. We arrived ten minutes early for our 7:00 pm reservation, and at twenty after I asked about the delay I was told diners were done but not leaving their tables. I always wondered why people can't be directed into the bar at a certain point in order to clear the table.We were finally seated after 7:40, but I slid into something wet on the seat. When we got that handled--we waited too long for someone to hand me a cloth napkin to clean it myself--I immediately saw that there was dried food caked on my fork. Not just a spot ... how did no one notice this?No one acknowledged us for quite a while--long enough for me to worry that coming here had been a mistake. When our server did arrive, weren't told about any specials or asked if we had any questions.The food is superb and arrived in an excellent timeframe. My husband had lobster and I had pepper steak. Both were delicious and perfectly cooked. The baked potato--assembled by our server--was creamy and full of fresh russet flavor.Our server was friendly and kind, as was the gentleman who packed up my to go box--he was a pleasure to talk with, as well as responsible for me leaving with a better opinion of the restaurant.First impressions are vitally important, however, and I won't be enthusiastic about going back. The forty minute wait for our reservation, a dirty booth, and a filthy fork, are quite memorable. But so is the food.",1
2440,6070,"Let me start by saying that we love the food at Del Rae.. growing up in Pico we never really went there because I always assumed it was a very expensive place and let's just say, you get what you pay for..   the service  is excellent from the moment you drive up to the valet, walk up to the hostess counter, get seated and then the every step of the way from there. They have some amazing wines that fit well with the delicious steaks, seafood and sides..  there is plenty of space even more so now with the outdoor dining and the speed of the service is amazingly fast.   The orders are spot on, the bread before your meal is hot and fresh, and did I mention the steaks...  OMG some of the best around and this coming from someone who grills weekly..  they definitely make it a memorable dining experience whether it be romantic with your spouse or fun with a small group of friends.  Definitely making it a more frequent place to splurge for a great meal..",1
2441,6071,3 hours for dinner was ridiculous but the food was very good. Service was friendly just unorganized. Would come back but not gonna be back anytime soon,0
2442,6072,Great food.  Great service.   Unbelievable place to have a nice dinner.  Great peppered New York steak.   Wife loved the sea bass.   Mac and cheese was great.,0
2443,6073,"I simply love being spoiled and the Dal Rae does that aplenty. My petite filet was so tender and Perfectly prepared. If you want rare or well done, it will be exact.The sides were delicious. The drinks tasty.I have been here a few times and I always leave simply delighted.Nancy have great service.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",0
2444,6074,"Old school all the way!  I adore the Kevin Costner look alike manager who made bananas flambé for us, table side.  Contrary to popular lore, this place is NOT named after a racehorse, but rather from a shortened version of the two founders' names... The relish tray was lovely, all the crunchiness on ice.  Ah, the old days of style and grace- you could imagine movie stars from the 50's dining in the next booth.  We had the ground steak with their signature green onion sauce.  Quite substantial and delicious.  A bit pricey, but the quality was there.  The waitress uniforms were just plain black shirts and pants- seems to me a place like this should be a bit dressier.  Nevertheless, a cool new  discovery for me in an expected part of town.",1
2445,6075,Piano bar is the best part of this location.   Singing along with the singer is permitted.There is a tip jar there for encouragement toplay your fave tunes.,1
2446,6076,"So grew up in Pico River Dal Rae is a hidden gem. People come from all over, the food is delish especially my favorite the Chilean Sea Bass  (ala ben). Great bar and music take you back to Frank Sinatra days but in a modern way.The only reason I give four stars because one of the things I Loved was their Martinis, because you could order one or two and they were so worth the price because they were like martinis are suppose be strong! But they have changed glasses are much smaller and you can have three and you feel not even a little buzz, disappointed they changed  the martinis.  Please bring them back !Because I will no longer order Martinis unless they change them back to the way they were.",0
2447,6077,"Went here to celebrate my 6th anniversary and everything was perfect. Had a reservation and were promptly seated. All staff was attentive and kind. Our server Robert provided the best experience we could have! He was great, knowledgeable and quick. Had the petite Ribeye (which was not all that petit,) peppercorn filet, half-shell oysters, and the crab stuffed mushrooms. Everything was delicious. Their caesar salad is also a must-try! Will definitely be returning as soon as I can.",0
2448,6078,"Came here after years of driving by saying I need to go thereWell, I was a bit dissapointed.Had an 8 o'clock reservation but wasn't seated till around 915.Ordered the Filet Minon and it was as dry as the Sahara desert.The ambiance is retro and nice, however, no dress code seems to be enforced . I saw men in sweats and others in shorts. Come on guys step up your game. If you're taking your lady out to a nice dinner then you should at least dress nice. This is more of a reflection on the clientele but maybe dress code should be addressed.Just my two cents.I'll give you one more try Del R.",0
2449,6079,"Great food, great service, and restaurant setting is full of character. Prime rib is delicious and exceeds the taste of Lawry's. Portions are also very generous. We have already recommended this place and will be back.",0
2450,6080,"I simply do not understand the 4-5 star ratings of this place. I have been coming here for years and it has been getting progressively worse.  Over the past year, I'm sorry to say I have been here 5 times, either for a client lunch/dinner and/or a special occasion (not my choice to come here but the one having the birthday chose it).  Today's lunch was atypical of what you get:1. Slow service: water and bread delivered right away.. where's the butter?  It comes 10 mins later2. Rushed to place order3. Food takes an hr to arrive.. and the waitress is no where to be found during that hour wait.  No drink refills..  no checking in.. Nothing4.  Waitress drops off food and runs off (doesn't ask if she could get anyone a thing else).  I had to have bus boy get us additional condiments.5.  Over cooked/ horribly prepared food.6.  Waitress never checks in to see how the food was.  7. Has to ask twice for billBottom line, this place is tired and old.  Never going back.",0
2451,6081,There's really not to much to say this place except fantastic. Just had my fathers 88th birthday here and couldn't have been happier. Everything from the food to the service to the ambience was perfect. Some might find it kind of pricey but you get what you pay for. I true throw back to how dining used to be and how it still should be.,0
2452,6082,"Is it me or has this place lost its touch. The meat doesn't seem to be on par anymore. We went and had a couple different cuts and both my husband and I were very disappointed. We had been there a few times before and even though it's not our go to steakhouse we enjoyed it for the most part- so this trip was surprising to us. Also, mules are my drink- this Moscow mule I had here was almost the worst one I'd ever had. I'm giving them a 3 stars simply because of the escargot and their wait staff- both were amazing.",0

2455,6085,"Fabulous. My grandpa has been dining here for forty or so years and took me here today on a lunch date. We're exploring LA's legendary restaurants and he insisted on Dal Rae as our lunch spot. The food was fantastic, we loved the servers and chatted with the the owner about the good old days when my grandpa would dine with his company at the piano bar. This restaurant deserves the best reviews and a spot in the legendary restaurants book. Order the Pepper Steak if you're a meat eater, and you can never go wrong with the Chilean Sea Bass. I can't wait to continue to come back here. It's so refreshing to dine somewhere that isn't trendy and has reliable honest to good food. Love love love.",0
2456,6086,Decided to do a date night with the husband and we were craving steak. Sister told us about this restaurant and since we were near by decided to give it a try. Outside looked like a simple diner..but once we walked in it was dim but very professional nice restaurant...food was amazing great price & quality (we both decided to get the prime rib) excellent food! Just super amazing! & customer service was super nice! We had Robert assist us during dinner and the food he and sides and desserts recommended was perfect! Definitely come by and check this restaurant out! We will be coming back soon!,0
2457,6087,"I live two cities over and have drove by Del Rae's plenty of times and never knew this place existed. I had the pleasure of going to Del Rae's for a friend birthday a couple of weeks ago, to my surprise I was very impressed. This restaurant is a hidden gem. The food is delicious, better than most of Hollywood's restaurants that charge an arm an a leg. The staff is super friendly and attentive. I love the old school feel of this place. I can't wait to go back.",0
2458,6088,"I've been going to this place for years!  It's a must go place to hangout in LA.  Its off the beaten path but it's well worth it!  You can eat in bar or dining room, both are killer hangout!   The Peppercorn Steak  is the ticket!  They also serve Steak Tartar, off menu but it's awesome....  Owner Lorin and Kevin Smith we greet you when entering, let Lorin Patrick set you!",0
2459,6089,We came here for our annual Food Club's Christmas! It was fancy as we expected and food was good. I liked that they allowed us to open presents. We tried a lot of the dishes a d no one complained! Great job! We would go back!,1
2460,6090,I found the Dal Rae in Pico Rivera good food! I had the prime rib sandwich. The meat was good and plentyful!! The bun was superb and a crispy tender crust! What I found on the check bothers me! The suggested tip on the bill calculates the tip on the total bill including on the tax! This was never supposed to be this way and the tip should be calculated on the cost of food and drinks! Please Dal Rae correct this oversight! Also I found the staff attentive and I felt well care for!! I shall return in the future!,0
2461,6091,Great ambience especially if you like dark romantic candle lit dinners.  When I go to Dal Rae I feel like I'm in an episode of Mad Men from AMC. This restaurant takes you back to late 50s early 60s people drank cocktails in the middle of the day and smoke cigars. The food is delicious especially the Chilean sea bass is excellent alcoholic beverages a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. This is probably the best restaurant in all of Pico Rivera.,0
2462,6092,"Celebrating my 21st birthday with my favorite mom!We had excellent service starting with our waitress Gabriella and her friendly welcome, to David our server and Jesus (Chuy)  we're a dynamic trio. This was my first time there but will not be my last!Great lobster!",0
2463,6093,"Went here for dinner and was not disappointed. We ordered drinks, appetizers, dinner, and dessert -- everything tasted really good. I'm usually skeptical about ordering a Sazerac outside of New Orleans but Dal Rae makes a nice one. I'm still thinking about the Caesar salad, which is prepared table-side, it was quite delectable. The staff was wonderful.",0
2464,6094,"Maybe it was an off night for Dal Rae, I got the prime rib and it was dull no exciting flavor, wife got the Sea bass it was really good. Thumbs up! Daughter got the New York steak okay again nothing exciting. Service was not very good. I felt as if our waitress forgot about our table. Overall I think it is time to stay away from this place until COVID is over.",0
2465,6095,I have decided this is my favorite steakhouse. Came here this evening to celebrate my brother's birthday and the food and service was excellent. Erin was our waitress and she was friendly and attentive- very sweet. The filet mignon medallions were delicious! My brother had the ribeye steak and he was very satisfied...chocolate soufflé for dessert was the perfect finish to the meal.,0
2466,6096,"Omg. The food. The service. The ambiance! We had the goat cheese salad, pepper steak, baked potato, blackened salmon, and crepe brûlée. First time dining and we can't wait to return. It was a busy Friday night, but we were checked on multiple times!",0
2467,6097,"This place is absolutely amazing! The food is incredible! You must get the Chilean sea bass, best item on the menu. The martinis are excellent. Every time I come here, the place does not disappoint. Service is great too. Typically I have reservations, but today I walked in on a Saturday night and they had an open table and seated me right away. Great ambiance too!!",0

2470,6100,"Came here for Valentine's Day last year, I would not recommend coming here for that special day. My husband made reservations and we still waited about 45 mins. When we were finally sat, they bring us to a tiny table crowded next to many other tiny tables. I felt so uncomfortable, I tried to make the best of it. We ordered steaks and honestly not the best I've had. All an all not the place for Valentine's Day dinner.",0
2471,6101,What is there not to like?! Googie sign and amazing mid century lamp fixtures! We come here every now and then even just to have cocktails. They make a decent gin Martini and the food is actually pretty good. They are pretty much always packed but you can always manage to get seated without a reservation if you are willing to wait @ the bar. Definitely a landmark spot that should be on everyone's bucket list if you are from the area.,0
2472,6102,Used to go here every year for our anniversary. Two times in a row now extremely disappointed in food and service and overpriced for less quantity.They seem to forget the quality they had back in the 70's and 80's( yes we've been coming that long ) but now it's going downhill quick. Will never return again. A TIP : Servers need to be more attentive to customers bye forever.,1
2473,6103,"i was def skeptical about dal rae for a birthday dinner when there are so many ""fancier"" places in town.  ""a steak house in pico??"" yas!made a reservation via opentable and were promptly seated.  this is def an old school kinda place, interior looks like it has been updated since the 70s maybe.  the table comes with a complimentary.. cold veggie plate?? im not sure, ive literally never been presented with one before but its olives, cucumbers, celery, carrots, radishes, and some other stuff on a bed of ice as well as complimentary bread.we ordered the escargots (SO GOOD) to start, and for mains - the tomahawk and prime rib.  the entrees come with sides so we already had mashed potatoes and fries.  while the tomahawk is more impressive visually, the prime rib is where its at! so tender and juicy.  cooked to perfection.  yummy in my tummy!!we opted for the souffle at the end of the meal and it was underwhelming hahaha should've just left it out.  the only negative is that i'm a little OCD and i like to have my togo packed a certain way.  our waiter just scraped everything off the plate and plopped it into the to-go container... nooo!!! i woudl've just preferred to do it myself but oh well.  still would come back.parking is valet so no worries there.",0
2474,6104,"I just had lunch here yesterday 3/7/2017 with a few coworkers and we had a great time.  I had their Peppered Filet Mignon (medium rare) and it was absolutely delicious!!!The dish came with mashed potatoes and asparagus as sides and the Filet had chives and bacon bits as it's garnishing everything was cooked to perfection.  The portion was more than enough for and it only set me back $36 (price for entre).  Affordable and great tasting!!Valet Parking is available and the service is impeccable, definitely a must try!  Will definitely continue coming here!!!",0
2475,6105,I went to lunch here yesterday.  I didn't know anything about the restaurant.   A friend suggested it and said it was fantastic.  I found the food less than average.  I dont go to restaurants that serve frozen food.  I ordered fried zucchini.   I received a huge portion of big round pieces of fried zucchini.   Unfortunately...I picked one up and it fell apart. ..the zucchini itself was wet and still frozen.   The crust fell off.  Water was dripping down my hand from the defrosting vegetable.   It was disgusting. I told the waitress.  She said she would talk to the manager.  No manager ever responded to us and the waitress told us that she spoke to the chef...so??? No customer service and frozen food.  I will not go back.,0
2476,6106,"Excellent excellent costumer service, from the host, waiter, food packer. Nice ambience. Excellent food, good quality. Drinks are strong and good. Our waiter Robert M. was excellent, patient, nice. He replaced all our silverware, consistently refilled water without being asked. I will definitely be back. Now a new life long costumer. Thanks staff!",0
2477,6107,"I really wanted to love this restaurant, but I couldn't. One of my foodie girlfriends and I decided to come here on a whim. We were able to easily make a quick reservation for a Monday night. The restaurant has an old school vibe of Sinatra days, but it's well kept and there is some modernness here and there.Let me start with the GOOD. We really liked our waiter, Jared. He was very nice and personable. Our bus staff was friendly too.The food we LIKED was the Caesar salad with dressing made from scratch table side. It was big enough for a starter for two. We really like our dessert of cherries jubilee, also prepared and flambéed table side.Things that were OKAY include the petite filet peppered steak that they are famous for. The steak was a perfect medium rare that we ordered. However, we were not a fan of the flavor. I will say that is probably just our personal preference. The mash potatoes as well. They was good, but not very hot.What was NOT GOOD at all was the crab stuffed mushroom caps. They were kind of gross. I think it had a lot to do with the taste of their Hollandaise sauce. Also, when we sat down, the table cloth was dirty and we were missing a bread plate and a fork. I think that the hostess should have remedied this situation before leaving us at our table.OVERALL, for the price, I expect much better.",1
2478,6108,"I have had very good experiences here in the past.  Not too good today, too much attitude.  We have had reservations (Open Table) for two or three weeks.  We never know with traffic, how long it will take to drive here, we ended up early today. When we check in, we are directed to the lounge to wait.  But there are no chairs available.  My husband goes back and asks if we can just be seated. Restaurant is 60% empty.  They have just seated walk-ins who have no reservations.  But, NO, we cannot be seated til the whole party is here!  We are told it's the rule...but the attitude is a little snotty.  So you can seat walk-ins, but those with reservations have to stand and wait?Who came up with that lousy policy?  And no host or hostess should cop an attitude when a guest with a reservation asks to be seated when you have a ton of empty tables.Yes, the food was good.  Server not very friendly, but she was probably too slammed at holiday time, so we had very minimal interaction with her.",0
2479,6109,"I grew up in Pico Rivera since 1972 and had never visited Dal Rae. I met a client who at Dal Rae that was driving from DTLA and I from the OC. This was a central location. Stepping into the restaurant was like stepping into a time capsule, back to the 1950's I imagined. The halibut was fresh and cooked to perfection. The service was impeccable; we were given enough attention but also the space to conduct our business. I will return soon!",0
2480,6110,"Been here hundreds of times over 20 years. Before, during and after poker sessions at the commerce. Because of this I generally get the ""old school service"" from my regular waiters/bartenders which is VERY GOOD. That service includes complimentary relish tray and bread service without begging for it. When there is a new employee I get the ""new service"" which is awful. Must beg for relish tray and bread and their are extra charges on the bill.I'm afraid to give the names of the greats old school servers there because maybe what they give me and all the other 50+ crowd is against new company policy but let me tell you if I got the ""new service"" every time I'd never come again. It's insulting when paying $100 for a steak and two glasses of wine don't nickel and dime me on a veggie tray.",0
2481,6111,"1. Parking pricey. Only valet offered at 4.50. Attendants were very nice.2. Reservations recommended.3. Table service wait time was not acceptable for a fancy place.4.

Almost as if they are related some bow.Others have enjoyed it, however those with class will pass.",1
2482,6112,"Went to Dal Rae for my father-in-law and husband's birthday. My son ordered the peppered filet and 1/2 way through it, found a hair underneath. A long, black hair! My husband called the server over and she got him a fresh plate, but I must say the hair pretty much grossed us out. This is suppose to be a high end restaurant, finding a hair on your plate is disgusting and dirty! Our bill was over $400. The sautéed spinach was swimming in oil.  I'm being generous with a 3 star review.",0
2483,6113,"Worst old place. Customer service is horrible. The girls are like kiss, kiss, kiss to the people they know, get them seated and everyone else has to wait. Our reservation was at 7:30, at 8 they still had 4 people in front of us plus all the people they squeezed in ahead of us. We walked out. Not even the gift card we were given was enough to make is stay longer to eat for free. We went to El Pescador in Montebello instead, great service and food.",0
2484,6114,We were here for Dine LA. My friends used to rave about it. We ordered the Pepper Steak as 2nd course. It was overloaded with spring onions. Meat was old. Left an after taste the whole night despite all the mints. Really not worth the price and it has squeezy seatings. Clearman's a better choice.,0
2485,6115,"I love the food at Dal Rae! Delicious and fresh. I did have one problem with my most recent visit. With the prices they charge, I expect to have excellent service along with my food experience. Last Tuesday, we went for Dine Iin LA, as we do twice yearly.  We had a server, Carrie. She was very impatient, didn't greet us well, or tell us about the specials. I had to ask her for a  baked potato because she didn't ask us our preferences while taking our orders- seemed bothered that  I asked. Came around once during the meal to check on us and seemed stressed. With the kinda of tips she's probably making, the service should have been premium! I will make sure to speak up next time because this wasn't  the great meal that it usually is.....",0
2486,6116,I had been here before and the serives was on point today was like wow not even a piece of bread. I could not even get my drinks and the  waitress was so rude she walk by 3 times till I had to call her at the end we had to walk out would not expect this from this restaurant,1
2487,6117,"Dal Rae is the kind of restaurant you go to for a special occasion or a serious business meeting. The restaurant offers valet parking which is very convenient as their parking lot is small. Once inside this place you feel like you've walked into a mid-century dinner party. The dining area is dimly lit and the decor is a combination of old and new. You're seated by the hostess and an entire staff awaits you for an excellent dining experience. Today, I had the Chilean Bas A La Ben as my main dish. It's served with mash potatoes and a small portion of steamed vegetables. I also ordered fried calamari, fried zucchini, and the stuffed mushrooms. The appetizers weren't anything to write home about but they were ok. Overall the restaurant never disappoints.",0
2488,6118,"I'm only giving this 2 stars because we've come to this restaurant almost every Christmas Eve and it's always been amazing. This year, however, we waited over 30 minutes for a reservation we had made months in advance. They sat us in a very high traffic area when they knew we had 2 small children (they usually seat us in a back table). The service was extremely slow and one of the servers yelled at my child for being in the way. My grandma- 89 years old- did not receive her meal until at least 15 minutes after everyone else at the table. My parents, who were paying, asked to speak to a manager regarding the server who yelled at my 3 year old. Then, and only then, did our server become more friendly. If I were my parents, I would've demanded a discount on our meal but they didn't because they are too nice. Never, will I ever, come back to this restaurant. We all have our off days but this was one thing after another for an extremely expensive restaurant.",0
2489,6119,"Old school looking  and feeling place.Very dark piano bar area.I had their signature pepper steak. It's great. If you go there, be sure and get it. That's what they're known for and when you eat one, you'll know why.",1
2490,6120,"A very traditional, fine dining establishment with the expected adjustments to California's casual dressing preferences. Dining room is overly crowded making the signature, at table preparations somewhat problematic. Good quality meat and fish. Excellent caeser salad, shrimp scampi app, and steak diane. Good wine list and cocktails. Service is generally above average, but there can be delays and mistakes due to the popularity of the restaurant-especially for special occasions. Valet parking.",0
2491,6121,This place is Amazing! From the atmosphere to the service . Their steaks and drinks are simply Amazing! Looking foward to coming again,1
2492,6122,"Very nice experience, I cannot give them 5 stars because of the service, the rest it is 5 without any doubts.We asked for the traditional Caesars salad and it is worth the $20. The ""tall guy"" prepares the salad in front of you while, probably the best one you will ever have.My wife asked for the prime rib, it was huge, cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful.I asked for the filet mignon pepper steak and the same, just pure pleasure.In other words, except for a 3.5* service and a big bill (expect to pay at least $130 for 2 people), the  steaks are as good as you can get, I cannot think of any other place (in California) better than this.",0

2495,6125,"Funny how I found out about this place.  Normally my wife and I don't listen to 1430AM which is a Chinese radio station.  Somehow she turned to it and I was listening to a lady give a review about a steakhouse in Pico Rivera.  My first response was What??? A steakhouse in Pico Rivera???  They never gave the name of the place but after some listening and listening in on some of the clues they gave we found this place on Yelp.  After looking at the reviews and pictures on Yelp we made reservations for the next night.Upon arrival just looking at the outside if you were driving by you would have never known that it was a steakhouse.  They have valet parking and cost $3.50 which is not bad.  We had reservations at 5:30pm, (took advantage of some extra points from OpenTable) and were seated right away.  Within a couple of mins water was brought to us along with bread and an assortment of veggies on a bed of ice.After looking over the menu we opted for the prim rib, Chilean seabass, Caesar salad for 2, and the chocolate souffle.The Caesar salad was made at table side and dressing was made on the spot.  This is traditional old school Caesar dressing, anchovy paste, garlic, Worcester sauce, etc.  It was good but IMO it was a bit heavy and a bit too much cheese in there.  Good to try once but I'll probably try a different salad next time.The Prime Rib was DELICIOUS.  Came out medium just like I asked for (some places just can't get it right, but this place did).  Super moist and tender and personally I believe it taste better than Lawry's.My wife had the Chilean Seabass and upon first impression I was impressed with the size of the portion that was given.  Many places will give you a small cut but they give you a very nice portion and it was awesome.  My wife is not a huge fan of fish so when she said that the seabass was one of the best one's she's had well that's pretty impressive.  I had a bite too and I think it's one of the best I've ever had too.The Chocolate Souffle came (needs 30 min prep time, order this as soon as your dinner get's here) it came with a side of whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  Now for sake of argument I've had Chocolate Souffle's at many other places before but I have to say this one was AWESOME.  It's not super sweet and you get a nice rich chocolate flavor.  Very nicely done.Overall a very nice experience. I would definitely come back.  Who would have thought there would be a great steakhouse in Pico Rivera and it's about 15 mins from my house.Oh and P.S. I have some Lawry's VIP coupons that I've been holding onto that will now be going into the trash.  Don't have to drive to the west side anymore for good prime rib.",1
2496,6126,"I came to Dal Rae for a Dry Manhattan (rye, please), a steak, and service that makes me feel like a champ. I got exactly what I came for, plus a little nostalgia.We like to feel nostalgic about something in our past because it makes us feel better.  We are more generous and happy in our nostalgic past. We loved more freely, and felt the warmth of others even on a cold day.  If channeled constructively, nostalgia can make us optimistic about our future, and maybe we start to feel like today might be ""the good old days"" someday.The Dal Rae is from a better time and place, and though I was not living here at the time, I felt wistful about the days when the Dal Rae was THE place to go.  Time has largely passed the old girl by.  Back in her day, about the most exciting thing to do was get dressed up to be ""seen"" at a fancy restaurant.  The décor and music, tables and decorations, and just everything here is like a time capsule from around 1957, I guess.  They know how to make a Dry Manhattan.",1
2497,6127,"It's overrated. There a better chop houses to go to nowadays. Perhaps this was the spot many years ago but it is not anymore.The steaks are at par level, nothing to rave about.What you are paying for is the nostalgia of antiquities because the decor has not changed. Anyone who brags that they've gone here to have great steak is compensating for not knowing great steak.I'm kind of sad because this place has the capacity to become great again, sadly because of their branding and no one calling them out on it, people will still flock here thinking it's the best.",0
2498,6128,Very consistent experience.  Love the food and the service. I recommend this fine dining restaurant to everyone.  Best fine dining location in the Pico / Downey / Whittier area.,0
2499,6129,Came here on a Tuesday night. Food was magnificent. The waitress didn't seem to pleasant to be working. She made us feel uncomfortable. Another thing about this place is that it's extremely dark! Be careful when your walking to your table and leaving.,0
2500,6130,"Okay, if the young 'uns complaining about the prices, the food, the service, whatever, have to put ageist remarks in their reviews (""this place is for old white folks""), then you're fair game.  I realize there are some very bright youngsters just as I realize there are a bunch of idiot youngsters and why they come to a place like the Dal Rae, when they kind of know what the prices are and that it's the kind of place LA used to be filled with, is anyone's guess.  And dear Jose H - did you really just play the race card?  Really?  But enough about you and more about the Dal Rae.I've been hearing about this place for years - but rarely go to Pico Rivera.  Actually, I've NEVER been to Pico Rivera and yes, I'm an LA native.  Pico Blvd. yes, Pico Rivera I don't know from.  So, I went to a birthday dinner there (not mine) and finally got to partake of the Dal Rae.  Now, my father owned an incredible steakhouse in LA, back in the day - I know from steaks and I know from this kind of restaurant.  So, when I go to a chop house it's like coming home for me.  Our party arrived twenty minutes ahead of our reservation.  We were not kept waiting, but instead we were seated immediately.  THAT, young people, is service and how it's done.  We had a wonderful wait person whose name I didn't get, so I can't give her a shout out.  Okay, so the food.  I know you're all waiting to hear how I liked the food.  You're yearning to hear how I liked the food because, you know, I ""get"" the food at places like this.  I began with a shrimp cocktail - perfect and huge shrimp, the way my father's restaurant had 'em.  Then they brought us the garlic cheese toast and that was quite popular with the populace at our table.  QUITE popular.  I was waffling between several dishes but our fun wait person suggested I go with the pepper steak, as that's their specialty.  And so I did - the New York.  Before I get to that, the time between courses was just right - not too quick and not too long.  I also split a Caesar salad with the birthday girl (the Caesar is for two and each portion is huge).  Now, you either know how to make a Caesar salad or you don't.  Every restaurant has a Caesar and 90% of them are shams, fakes, phonies - I don't EVER want to see creamy dressing on a Caesar salad - just call that something else.  Here, they make it as it should be made - table side, egg yolk, the whole deal and it was great.  By the way, to my new pal Jose, here, you know, the guy who played the race card in his review - just about every ethnicity was represented in the restaurant.  Including this Jew, and I'm not playing the Jew card in this review.  Did I just go off on a tangent.  Back to the food.The steak was amazing - whatever that stuff they put on top of it is, it's flavorful and yes, I ate every single bite, much to the astonishment of everyone at the table.  I'm being especially calorie conscious these days, and while you might think a 12oz. steak is crazy, calorie-wise it's not.  In fact, you won't believe how calorie-friendly it is - about 400 calories to be exact.  Google is your friend.  I'm your friend.  You can thank me later.  This review is turning into War and Peace.  The asparagus was fine, the baked potato was fine, and I was stuffed but feeling good and had just enough room for a creme brûlée afterwards, which was also excellent.  Is it pricey?  Of course.  It's an old-fashioned chop house - they're pricey.  My father's restaurant was pricey.  A New York there cost 4.95.  Of course, that was in 1959, so there's that.  In any case, this place is the berries (that's a good thing, oh, children of Yelp) and you'll have a swell time and you won't have to play the race or religion card either.  Finally, how does it compare to other places of its ilk?  Well, I'll tell you, because why should I withhold such information on Yelp?  Much better than The Smoke House.  Can't compare to Ruth's Chris because that's a very specific kind of nouveau steak house.  Haven't been to Mastro's but even looking at photos and reading reviews here it is clearly ripped off from Ruth's Chris.  So, this place gets my highest rating.  The End.",0

2502,6132,I am giving this restaurant 5 stars for the food and especially our waitress JACKIE....she was so accommodating and overall the best waitress we have had!!  The restaurant was overbooked and extremely crowded on Father's Day!  Too many tables and difficult to walk between due to the number of tables....not comfortable!Thank you JACKIE for making Father's Day great for our family.....,0
2503,6133,not worth the $6 shake down by the valet guys. since when is valet mandatory? i forgot to mention it to manager when i was asked if everything was ok with my dinner,1
2504,6134,"Came on a Tuesday night for a business dinner. Made reservations the night before for 7-8 people at 6pm.  When I arrived, was greeted by the hostess, skinny lady w Blonde heir. As she led me to the table, the phone rings. She stops a bus (boy) and asked him to take me to the table because she had to pick up the phone? Ok, sure. That's fine.I get to my table and three of my co-workers were already there. So 6pm reservations were on point. Wasn't that crowded as I walked through, but I was also seated w my back towards the dining room the rest of the night. Liz was our server. A+ job to her!! She kept us entertained and fulfilled EVERY request my quirky co-worker had.  She gave us the rundown on some of the popular items.  A basket of bread came out, then a veggie plate. What the heck is that?? There were celery, radish, pickles, some kind of marinated peppers, carrots, and green onion?? Do u eat the green onion just like that?  Or is it garnish? Cheese bread! Yum! (By the end of the night my coworker asked for some Togo!) They cleared away the bread/appetizer plate, veggie tray, bread, and butter so they can serve the soups and salads. Wish they left the butter for the baked potato I was having. They had cheesy bread too! That was yummy!  Poor waiter was making the table side salad by the emergency exit?? Poor man was crammed back there! One coworker ordered baked scallops. When ur came out, smelled fishy. Then it was in an abalone shell. Why an abalone shell?  Everything came out in a timely matter and all orders were correct. Four of us had the regular cut of prime rib. I was disappointed when the food server gave me the smallest piece. Was it cuz I was the only lady there?? Did I look dainty?? Heck NO! I EAT! The two guys who got the bigger piece and with the bones, did not eat it finish. So sad. I took mine home! The only complaint I have besides the price and the blonde host is that they keep taking away the plates and utensils before you are done!I know the valet is not Dal Rae's, but why do I have to pay $4.50 when my car was in the 2nd spot? LolOh well.",1
2505,6135,I guess if you're in the area you can check it out if you don't feel like driving out to a better steakhouse.,1
2506,6136,"By far the best Filet Mignon I've ever had! It's was so juicy & tender, it literally melted in my mouth. The cocktails were good only thing that I thought was odd was that we had a few drinks at the bar prior to being seated & the bartender charged us more than what we paid at the dining area for our drinks, regardless they were good.Our server Lilly was so down to earth & attentive! This place has quality food, a classy ambiance & excellent service! We're definitely coming back very soon!",0

2508,6138,"I would like to preface this review by stating that I understand this is a proper restaurant and as such, look forward to dining here someday. Today however, I decided to pop in by myself for a late lunch. Today's meal was the house burger with cheese and fries . as follows. The burger itself is assembled as follows: {ciabatta roll; premium hand formed ground beef patty; cheddar; thick cut bacon; avocado; thousand island dressing on the side}. There isn't much to making to burgers, they're hard to fuck up. It was just a matter of expert application of heat to quality ingredients competently assembled. The server, Dawn Ver was good enough, though she never really stopped to see how I was doing.The only thing that detracted from my hamburger lunch was the cocktail waitress Rose who refused to get me my sprite. Maybe it was because she wasn't my waitress, maybe it's because I tried speaking Spanish to her at first, maybe because I'm brown like her and younger,  whatever the reason, she ten feet from ear shot and complained to the bartender about this ""gentleman who she doesn't know"" wanting a sprite. Her intonation was clearly and distinctly upset. I was the only male in the nearly room. Dawn apologized. The bartender never even bothered.",0

2511,6141,"Always a fun and yummy experience! Great food, excellent service and a beautiful atmosphere! Good French onion soup, skip the artichoke, delicious wedge salad, unbelievable steaks, all expertly prepared as ordered and very good desserts. The creme brûlée was perfect. A nice place to go for a special birthday or anniversary! Good bar selections and fairly reasonable. Corkage= $25 per bottle",0
2512,6142,"We really enjoyed this restaurant. It was my first time there. We started with a couple of drinks at the bar. The one thing that could have been better is if the bartender knew how to make a caipirinha. It isn't a super exotic or unknown drink, but he apparently did not know what it was. And they did not have the ingredients for a mojito. I ended up with a moscow mule, and it was very tasty. At dinner we got steak of course, I believe we got the pepper steak and the filet mignon and the calamari to start. Everything was very delicious. Service was exceptional. The atmosphere is very classy, dark but lively. They also had music in the room adjacent to the bar area. Overall a fantastic evening.",0
2513,6143,"This was our second family dinner at Dal Rae Restaurant. The food was even more delicious than I recall and the portions were plentiful. The Chilean sea bass was especially fantastic!

Everything was amazing the service was wonderful, thank you to our waiter Robert he was knowledgeable in all the foods we had questions about, he was very patient with us when it came to us deciding what to eat , he was also very attentive in attending to our table from appetizers all the way until dessert. We left super full and happy! So thank you to Dal Rae for the wonderful service!",0

2518,6148,"The husband and I came here for a Saturday dinner. ""Fancy"" dinner dates are far and in between for us because babysitters are not a luxury we come by very often. Luckily, we found a tiny window of opportunity this past weekend. We did not have reservations but were thankfully seated immediately, it was about 5p.m. We've driven by this place for years and it's been on our list of restaurants to go to for steak. It's a nice little jewel in the middle of Pico that's for sure. The dimly lit restaurant provided a romantic atmosphere. It also helped hide the fact that I felt a bit underdressed. The median age in this restaurant was about 50 and over, no kidding, we felt like the youngest couple in there . Our server was very nice and attentive. I started off with a lemon drop which was delicious. We then ordered the tuna tartare tower as an appetizer; it was so delicious and flavorful. We also each ordered the different soups of the day (not included with your dinner mind you), the cream of mushroom soup and the french onion soup. Both soups were yummy, but the mushroom soup was my favorite. I ordered the filet mignon and regretted getting it medium. I should have ordered it medium rare. In my defense, I hadn't had filet mignon in a while and had forgotten how I like it, rookie mistake. It was good but not memorable. I always compare my filet mignons to the one at the Butcher's Table in Seattle. That's how high the bar is set for me when it comes to this cut of meat. My dinner came with asparagus and I chose the baked potato, which the server prepares for you table side. For dessert we ordered the Grand Marnier souffle, which you should order when you get your dinner because it takes 25 minutes to come out. The dessert by far was my favorite! It was so yummy; I still can't stop thinking about how good it was. When dinner was done, hubby and I agreed that it would be worth come back here for cocktails and dessert! And also to try the prime rib. The end.",0
2519,6149,"Came in to celebrate sis in laws 51st...cozy old school atmosphere...food is not bad, a little over rated in my opinion, but there reputation and attention to details makes up for it. Funny that the best thing I've had here is the poor man's pepper steak, which is a ground beef patty. Just be sure to order it well done.",0
2520,6150,I've been coming to Dal Rae for years but this past Saturdays experience wasn't the usual five star that so many of us are accustomed to. Two things stood out the most. The first was the wait time from ordering to receiving my food. I ordered at about 8:45 and didn't get my filet until about 10pm. The second issue was that the steak wasn't cooked correctly which is very strange since in the past it has been excellent. I read some other recent reviews and this appears to be a recent trend. I'll definitely be giving Dal Rae another shot as I hope this was just a one-off experience.,0
2521,6151,"We love Dal Rae for dinner but they could only muster three stars for lunch. We still love the staff and the service, but the twist they placed on one of our entrees was a downer. Their version of Beef Stroganoff is nothing like any we've ever tasted. Not bad, just not Beef Stroganoff.First off they use penne pasta, not the traditional ribbon. That should have been a clue.  As good as they prepare their Steak Diane, imagine our disappointment in their sauce. It's more like an Italian sauce of some kind as there is a strong hint of tomato throughout. If there was brandy, dijon mustard, or sour cream in there, we could not detect it.I wanted to try the Poor Mans Pepper Steak but I was not specific enough when ordering so I wound up getting the full-blown filet mignon version. It was excellent but I wasn't planning on a $35 lunch entree. At least now I can take that off my dinner list of things to I still want to try. I would order it again but not for lunch.We also tried the baked brie for the first time and would definitely try that again.Our server offered to replace the Stroganoff but we declined and we took it home and re-worked it the next day. It was surprisingly better!Take away from this visit: stick to our favs with dinner, though we're going back for lunch again soon and may just have to step out of the box again.",0
2522,6152,"Food was good but very pricey, out first ten seconds inside the restaurant we overheard a waitress loudly tell the hostess ""a woman just asked to substitute an item, where does she think she's at? A Outback Steakhouse? Ugh!"" I want to say everyone there had a snobbish attitude but that's not true, not everyone did, uncomfortable experience for a romantic dinner, def spoiled the night",1
2523,6153,"Second experience here was not good at all. The service was very slow. We were ignored for long periods of time while other tables got served. One and a half hours to get our main course with bread and appetizers coming out super slow was a bit too much. The Manager asked if everything was ok and when told him it was too slow he was very dismissive. Not going to waste another night here. There are too many other better, closer choices.",0
2524,6154,Great food and service! I had the chicken piccata and my fiancee had the petite filet minon. Both dishes were cooked to perfection. Service was on point. Place has a classic vibe to it. We thoroughly enjoyed the whole dining experience. We will be back!,0
2525,6155,"$242.00 for dinner!!!The food was excellent and the service was on a completely different level.  Our server, China was so friendly, helpful, and made our night a little more memorable.I chose the peppercorn fillet, and it was amazing, I highly recommend it.  Afterwards I hade the apple cobbler and some coffee.  The coffee was so good I asked what kind it was, and the manager brought out a package for me to take home.  The price was high but so worth it.",0
2526,6156,"I had a great time here. My parents are regulars at this restaurant and we went last night for their birthday. There was six of us and we sat in the very front by the band.The food was incredible! I had the veal that came with asparagus and mashed potatoes.   Everyone else had steak or seafood which was also amazing. The owner is a great and friendly guy. He came by and spoke to us all for bit and wished my parents a happy birthday.The price is fairly reasonable for a steakhouse and the drinks are very strong as well. If you go, try getting a table near the bar (where the band plays).",1

2528,6158,"Our company holiday party was hosted here.The staff was amazing. They were super nice, helpful, and very attentive.They circled around a couple appetizers and were prompt with constant drink service.We had the option of the Chilean Sea Bass, Peppered Steak, or Pasta with Shrimp as an entree.Some at our table mentioned the sea bass wasn't as tender as she had at other places but it had good flavor. It was a big piece of fish too.I had the Peppered Steak Med Rare ++ (more rare than medium).The server came by after the food came out to check to make sure the steak was cooked properly. It really made me feel like she was paying attention, and yes the steak was cooked the way I had requested. It was juicy and flavorful.We also had creme brulee, chocolate mousse cake, tiramisu as dessert options. I was too stuffed from everything before hand and we asked to pack up the creme brulee and cake that we had originally requested.She came back with our togo boxes and I guess she overheard me saying that I wanted to try all 3 because she mentioned she packed up all 3 of the desserts for us to take home. So sweet of her.The banquet room twinkled with Christmas lights and before we even got to entrees our group was having a blast. Right outside the room was the restroom so you didn't need to walk through the dining or bar area to get access to it so it was very convenient.The bar is fully stocked. I noticed they filed away the bottles like books so they had more in their inventory. But it wasn't just full of bottles, it was packed with people.I loved the atmosphere, the food and the staff. I can't wait to come back and experience my own selection off their full menu.",0
2529,6159,"More of a 3.5 but rounded down for a few things.Husband and I had a date night and decided to check out this place for DineLA on a Sunday night. Made reservations on OpenTable with no problem.They offer valet parking for $4.50. We actually missed the entrance and had to circle around. Busy for a Sunday night, but we were seated right away. We sat in a booth, but as I sat there were crumbs all over the seat and stuck to me and my dress. Not cool. We were served bread and the pickled/veggie platter and waters. Unfortunately, my water had lipstick all over (I know it wasn't me because I didn't have any on). Gross.We both ordered from the DineLA menu. For the first course, I had the mushrooms with lump crab. It came with two and it was just not good. Hardly any crab and mostly breading and filler. Presentation was sad too, the stuffing fell out of one and was to the side of the mushroom. I did not like this at all. Husband had the soup. Not bad, and pretty good with the bread. The second course was sooo much better. I had the Chilean Sea Bass ""ala Ben"". It was super favorable, and moist. I didn't care for my side choice, the rice pilaf. It was dry and lacked flavor. My husband had the Dal Rae Pepper Filet Mignon with mashed potatoes. His steak was really good and cooked a perfect medium rare. The potatoes were okay to me, but he felt they tasted like they were from a box. The cheese bread served with the main course was good too. Much better than out other carb sides. Dessert was okay. I had the creme brulee. It was a little more dense and creamier than I'm used to, but it was good. We took my husband's cheesecake home since we were so stuffed.Overall this place isn't too bad. A couple of negatives, but the main dishes were good. Maybe we'll come back. Maybe next DineLA. I did see someone order the lamb shank and that looked so good too.",1

2535,6165,If you don't have a reservation don't go. Lovely setting unfortunately we went the wrong day at the wrong time we don't get seated at the restaurant but we did get seated at the bar area big mistake it seem that a large group in a privet area where a little to waste and to crazy for a public place. The girls were stumble through the restaurant with no shoes on and using profanity. It usually doesn't bother me if I am only accompanied by only adult but in this case we where celebrating my fathers birthday so I had 3 children with me. I know it isn't the restaurants fault but I think for the money I spend they should of at least inform that party to behave like the adults they are. Overall the food was great big portions and great service. I accidentally tipped over my daughter's water and The waiter quickly changed the table cloth for me.,0
2536,6166,"This place was just mentioned in L.A. Magazine for their prime rib.  Without a doubt, it beats the tourist fare they serve at Lawry's, but it's not the best thing on their menu.This recent visit was for a company function.  They have a great private room that's been remodeled since I was last there.  Definitely an improvement and feels more contemporary.  But the Rat Pack vibe permeates this place like Frank Sinatra's aftershave.  I mean that in the best possible way.I ordered the peppered filet mignon. Always order it rare because THAT'S HOW FILET MIGNON should be eaten.  One of my dinner companions ordered it well done (vomit) so they had to butterfly it. What a bastardization of a good piece of meat.  They have some scrumptious appetizer selections.  The shrimp cocktail is about the size of a full grown ferret.  I went bonkers for the cheese platter with heaps of brie and some type of cheese ball covered in black and white sesame seeds.  Delicioso, mi amor.The service staff is exemplary.  Most of them have been working here for years and they do not say ""no"" to any strange requests.  The bar is fully stocked with almost every type of top shelf brand on the planet.  If you can't get snockered here, there's something wrong with you.I love places like Dal Rae because it is unique and a throwback to another era.  This is not a chain.  This is the real deal in the heart of Pico Rivera - of all places.  It's worth the drive just for the experience of the decor and huge portions of food alone.  Major thumbs up because it's everything I like about restaurant nostalgia.",0

It's really gone downhill from a few years ago - when we had our engagement dinner and everything was fabulous.Now, they try and squeeze way too many people in a small space.  My table was bumped 4x during dinner including once where my drink was spilled because there's not enough walking room between our table and the adjacent table.  The salmon I ordered was over cooked.  They charge way too much money for drinks and food and other options in the area are far better and a better deal.

We started dinner in the main dining room at 5:30 and it was nice and quiet. By the time we left at 7:30 it was packed and we were shouting at each other to talk. The bar area had a singer when we left and it was quieter than the main dining room. Next time I would ask to be seated in one of the other dining rooms, but otherwise, this place is perfect - I wish it was closer to my house!",0
2541,6171,At this place the best thing is Steak. This one thing is AMAZING the steak is perfect! The steak is 10oz so you can share and not be hungry. So if you don't eat meat or sea food this is not the place for you!,1
2542,6172,"I really enjoyed lunch at this restaurant. I ordered fried chicken with avocado, tomato and covered with melted cheese. It was delicious. The chicken was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I also tried their oysters, which were incredibly fresh. Their fried calamari melted in my mouth. The biggest surprise was perhaps the dessert - Raspberry Tiramisu - a must try for sure!",0
2543,6173,"Dal Rae's Famous Peppersteak= Prime NY or Filet Mignon?I tried both and the NY is the way to go. Unless you luck out and get a perfectly cooked Filet. Mine unfortunately came out kind of mushy. I don't know what exactly it was. I always order steak Med RARE, and have enjoyed the juicy, pinkness- always at other steakhouses. This filet was definitely pink in the middle, but was not moist and tender, but had an odd mushy texture- almost powdery tasting?. The NY was much better with a good sear and fattiness.On their menu, it says of their famous pepper steak ""Often copied, never equaled""- LA mag. Really? I've never seen anything like it! It catches you off guard, as the steak comes and it's covered in a pile of stuff! green onions, tiny meat (bacon?) morsels, tons of pepper. yelp.com/biz_photos/YRYo…The spicyness was pretty overwhelming. but to be expected= it's called PEPPER steak! i had to try it if it's what their famous for. I should have really gone with Robin B's fave - Seabass, which i'm sure i would have enjoyed better.What WAS a winner was their wilted spinach with warm BACON dressing (a little sour and salty). it's just that. no other frills. prepared tableside, good to share. It also comes with yummy garlic bread.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRYo…My coworker's hubby enjoyed his Frog Legs dish, saying it was the best he's ever had! i'll pass!yelp.com/biz_photos/YRYo…For dessert, they ran out of their souffles, so i shared a tiramisu yelp.com/biz_photos/YRYo… a lemon cakehttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YRYoQgriW2­EtLWiTTSdkjA?select=udXju9DWgMMRI46u-HG2mg. tiramisu was pretty yummy, but i would have loved a stronger marscapone flavor. lemon cake was rich, white chocolate leaf was impossible to break through and cream cheese frosting was not very cream cheesy.With our large group, service was a little slow, but we lucked out with waitresses who were very nice and patient.Valet parking: 3.50",0
2544,6174,"I went to Dal Rae a long time ago and tried its famous pepper steak.  In a nutshell: I didn't like it.I recently got a chance to come back again for a company holiday party.Fried calamari ($14.50): not crispy and not as tasty as other calamari I've tried.Mushrooms stuffed crab ($13.75):  the mushroom is super sour and weird.Shrimp cocktails ($16.95): plump giant shrimps with cocktail sauce.Shrimp scampi ($15.95): my friend likes it.Fire grilled artichoke ($10.75): 2 of my friends enjoy eating this.Filet mignon: I asked for a smaller size and it was the perfect size.  The steak wasn't bad but the mashed potato was so good.  It was buttery and delicious.  I had to ask the waiter to take it away from me.Chocolate fantasty ($7:50):  We shared a dessert and my friend picked this one.  The cake was okay but the mouse was so good, especially with crunchy candy pearls on top.3.5 stars!!Dal Rae's mashed potato & chocolate fantasy are yummylicious!!",1
2545,6175,"Still the best restaurant in the area.  Love the pepper steak filet, a must have.  The experience not to be missed is having the owner prepare a fresh Cesar salad for you tableside.We always stop in for a bite when we drive to Los Angeles...now that we live in La Jolla.Only recommendation to management is to spend a few dollars to upgrade the furniture...getting a little dilapidated.Highly recommended for Foodies everywhere.",0
2546,6176,"I absolutely love this place! My family and I have been going Dal Rae's for years(around 20). This is my go to for birthdays and anniversaries. I have ordered many things here but my go to is of course the peppered filet! You can't go wrong. My husband and I often split the filet and Chilean seabass and ahi on toast for an appetizer! The food is always cooked to perfection, service is great and ambiance is nice, dark and intimate.We usually get there before our reservations to get a drink at the bar.",0
2547,6177,Every couple of years when I want a special treat I go to Dal Rae's for lobster tail. On 8-25-19 my son took me to Dal Rae's for my celebration birthday dinner. I was sooo excited in anticipation of my lobster tail . WOW ! I did not want to believe that I was having to struggle to cut my lobster tail as if I was trying to cut into a rubber boot. I did not say anything to my son or Management as I did not want my son to feel bad for all his efforts in trying to make his mother happy. I don't know if it is Dal Rae's or the cook but I don't think I will be going back to Dal Rae's for lobster tail. Soooo Sad !!!!,1
2548,6178,"Rude receptionist, a older blonde lady. A male waiter gave my husband a glass water bottle that resembled a Voss water bottle so my husband asked if it was a water bottle he can drink from and keep and the server said yes. We still asked our waiter to make sure and she said we were able to take it home. As we were paying for our valet parking the elder blonde lady comes running out stating that someone told her that My husband was trying to walk out and take his water bottle as if he were stealing it. She was so unprofessional she caused many to stare at my husband as if he were a thief. They shouldn't be having their staff tell people to take the water bottles home if then they are going to be chased out and accused as thief's in front of others. I clearly told her it was their servers  who advised us they were to take home. Our bill came out to roughly $118, why would we care to steal a water bottle. Smh. Never coming back. She could've easily pulled him aside and told him personally instead of saying it out loud for others to hear and embarrassing him. So unprofessional!",0
2549,6179,"Alright I know what you guys are thinking old school isn't the new school but really old school has some awesome flavor and unique tastes.The standard is amazing and I love the decoration for Christmas.Yes the pepper steak is good  they have two selections but my favorite is the filet it is so nice and juicy.They potions are really large and honestly I loved the huge baked potato I had. :) Before our meal had even started, it was filled with loads of nice and free appetizer such as bread and this vegetable plate. Raw veggies are good for you !Had a wonderful dinner date and an awesome time. More food and loads of laughs ! A smile after eating a nice dinner is worth it. Happy New Year everyone! Time to start the year off strong!",1
2550,6180,"Very interesting place. I imagine myself in the era of Threes Company, and that Jack is going to come out and take my order. All I was thinking was where is Mr. Roper. To me, this is a good thing.The pepper steak is good, I got the poor man's pepper steak which I enjoyed, next time I'll have it medium. The two napkin burger is what my father got, and it was huge.Over all a good place with good service. It is literally a place out of a time machine, always interesting.",0
2551,6181,"Disappointed!!!! Made reservations for 7. We were seated in the patio area. With fans. When we asked to be seated inside we were told no. If we wanted to wait it would be 2 hours since other parties ""just sat down"". Pathetic. We decided to leave. We waited to valet to bring our cars. When we asked for the key (its push start) the guy said he didn't have it?!? Excuse me? How did you get the car to start? The guy said ""it starts automatically"" what in the world?!? My dad informed the guy he has the key and the guy said ""don't be lying"" My brother asked him to check his pockets and the valet guy pulls out the key from his shirt pocket!Worst experience ever! If I can give this review zero stars I would.Zero stars, zero professional manners, zero everything! From the hostess to the waitress to the valet very disrespectful and unprofessional.",0
2552,6182,"One of many delicious winter dineLA stops. A lil random in location and I really didn't know what to expect walking in. It's very old fashioned, designed like a romantic, fancy diner. With the bread that came out there was a plate of pickles and peppers... my group was a lil confused by this but it worked, some guys picked out the ones they liked and saved them to eat with entrees. Garlic bread came out a little later too! so addicting.I tried both the stuffed mushrooms and creamy chicken soup appetizers. They seem to have a pretty solid rep when it comes to soup so don't forget to ask about the soup of the day. Entrees came out in HUGE portions. None of us were able to finish more than half save for one impressive person who I'm convinced has a black hole for a stomach. I ordered the lamb shank which was super tender. The famous pepper steak was obviously good too.Dessert was SO satisfying...their version of a ""sundae"" was vanilla ice cream with a chocolate shell nested in a ...thin toffee wafer? is my best shot at an accurate description.The reason I don't give a full 5 stars is that we could have had a better server experience. We wrote down the items that we wanted charged to each card, and our server read it and motioned that she understood...then proceeded to split the bill evenly... wut...",1
2553,6183,The service was great! Good live music. Food was amazing!! Defiantly coming back here. Drinks were made right. Clean and great environment. Defiantly would recommend this place to my friends,0
2554,6184,"My family has been patronizing Dal Rae for years!  I would love to give them a four or five star rating, but the service and quality of food is inconsistent.When I'm with my parents it's usually a great dining experience.  I was always raving about this place, so my friends couldn't wait to try it!  I took a small group of friends and it was probably the worst service I've ever received.  Our waitress seemed irritated every time some one inquired about a menu item.  She was hard to track down if we needed anything, our drinks were never refilled and she was even harder to find when we were ready for the check.  It's not as if we're young high school kids.  We were a quiet group with ages ranging from the late twenties to early thirties.  I gave it another shot and brought a different group of friends and we encountered the same poor service.  My conclusion?  They only cater to older crowds and families.During dining experiences with my family, the manager made his rounds around the restaurant to ask about our dinner.  He skipped over our table when I was with my friends.  The crab cake appetizer is my favorite.  It has big chucks of crab with a light cilantro sauce.Petite filet pepper steak is a must at Dal Rae!  It's loaded with flavor and is accompanied with seasonal vegetables.My favorite dessert is the banana flambé!  Its prepared tableside.  The buttery brown sugar syrup is so bad for you but it tastes sooo good!!!  I was disappointed and embarrassed when I introduced this to my friends.  Our waitress over cooked it and the syrup became one hard caramel glob!",1
2555,6185,"I've been going to this place since Jesus was a baby.Very cool, old school, Vinnie and Gino are playing poker in the back before they go and whack a guy thing going on here. In fact, my uncle (who grew up in Pico in the 40's) said that the Dal Rae is still a place where celebs (old ones mind you) come and play cards in the back while gnawing on a fat T-bone.But the best part is the food.I ALWAYS start with he Ahi Sashimi on Toas . Huge slices of tuna over crumbled feta cheese, capers, parsley and pine nuts on toast triangles. Fucking yum.The steaks can't be beat. It's like you're in the Flinstones. Gigantasaurus.But the zenith of awesomeness goes to the Grand Marnier Supreme.Chocolate Ice Cream, Raspberry Sorbet, a huge shot of Grand Marnier.Prepared table side.Yeah, I know, it's the shit.The best night to go is Thursday because there's this crusty karaoke thing happening in the bar...fun for everyone if you ask me.One negative...the pastas - not so great.  But take that with a grain of salt as I am a picky Italian. ;)Enjoy!",1
2556,6186,The best steak ever!!! I was here a few days ago to celebrate a birthday and we had the best time. I love the ambiance! Definitely coming here again!!!,1
2557,6187,"Did you know that the 1950s never left Dal Rae in Pico Rivera? In fact, as I was driving up Washington Blvd, I already knew I was going somewhere special. From a few streets away, I could already see the tall beautiful neon sign with the restaurant name in blazing red lights. No cheesy backlit plastic for Dal Rae. It was class all the way.Upon entering the lobby, I was greeted by live music in the bar and two hostesses, who with their almost bouffant hair-dos helped set the stage for my 50s time warp. Inside the bustling restaurant, my eyes took in the wood paneled walls and the black leather banquettes and I felt right at home.Once seated, iced relish trays were swept onto to the table while drink orders were taken. While perusing the menu, we were able to crunch our way through cold crisp veggies. It's amazing to start your meal with fresh produce edibles. For someone who's eaten at a lot of restaurants, this was a welcome first for me.Speaking of the menu, Dal Rae's vintage menu contained old standbys like lobster thermidor, oysters Rockefeller and tableside Caesar. Desserts even included relics like bananas flamb and cherries jubilee.With all the choices, it was hard to decide but eventually everyone made their selections. After placing our orders, French bread, breadsticks and thick cracker wafers came out, soon followed by garlic bread. For our presently carb-conscious world, a lot of people would be running out the door screaming, but hey, in my 50s daze, I took helpings of both.Appetizers were ordered, but the one that held the most fascination was the escargot cooked in garlic butter. The aroma was so strong that I think people from the bar could have smelled it; yet, it was also so tantalizing that I may have been willing to forget that escargot was French for snails and sampled the dish anyway.After the appetizers were enjoyed and consumed, our steak fest began. After all, steak was the main reason we came to Dal Rae in the first place. Orders included Steak Diane, prepared tableside, as well as prime rib, steak and other various cuts of meat. For the meat entrees, it truly is all about the meat. The sides are kept simple. You get veggies and potatoes cooked in some fashion whether it's baked or French-fried.I ordered the Petite Filet Pepper Steak and it was cooked to perfection. Both tender and moist, it was literally packed with flavor. Just looking at it, I could see the black and white pepper embedded into the meat's surface. I was so enthralled with my steak that I barely touched the vegetables or my baked potato. My steak was just that good. The empty plates around the table conveyed how much we all loved Dal Rae's steak offerings.Amazingly enough, there was still room for dessert or perhaps it was our childish glee in seeing fruit set on fire that prompted us to order both the bananas flamb and the cherries jubilee. The tableside preparation of both our desserts was a sight to see with flames igniting the fruit and alcohol in the pans. But even better was savoring the hot sweetness of the fruit mixtures poured over the cold sweetness of vanilla ice cream. A perfect end to a perfect meal.So ended our time space continuum foray into 1950s steakhouse glory and wow, was it worth the trip. From start to finish, our time at Dal Rae was a sheer visual, atmospheric and culinary delight and if the only way I can come back is to sport a beehive, I'd do so without question.",0
2558,6188,"Ok..so I'm not a steak kinda girl, I kinda eat like a 5 yr old..lol. Went here yesterday for a special event..cousins retirement party..50 yrs! So anyway the kids told me to order the prime rib..so I did. AMAZING!! It was sooo wonderful! I mean really..it was so good! It was a large party and the staff was wonderful. Considering everyone was blocking the aisles talking..lol..they did great. Now this was a daytime event, so I'm not sure what regular dinner hours are like, but believe me I'll be back!!",0
2559,6189,"One of our favorite little hidden gems. Staff is friendly and welcoming. This place is full of old school class and charm. Many items are made table side. Bar is fully stocked.They bring a relish tray and warm crusty bread to your table to start you off. If you like steak I recommend the pepper steak, I prefer the filet and my husband loves the N.Y. Cut. These steaks are so good that even the left overs are tender, juicy, slices like butter even out of the microwave. The shrimp cocktail appetizer is enough to fill most. I had the baked potato with everything and it just melted in your mouth. For dessert my husband had the creme brûlée and I had the Grand Marnier Supreme which was made table side. Both are delicious!Parking is Valet only. It's a small lot do better to leave it to the professionals.",0
2560,6190,"I had just a horrific time here last year.  When it was time to take a closeby customer to lunch again this holiday season, they suggested Dal Rae again.  ""Dude, you still need to try their peppersteak...Hahahahahah"".  Fine.  Let's go again.  It could not get much worse.We had a much better time this year.  The place was pretty much the same as last year.  Unnecessary valet parking.  $3.50 service charge at lunch when the parking lot is huge.  The staff inside was just like the building..... Very aged but put together well.  The ladies were all decked out in their holiday best.... gray hair poofed out, lots of makeup.  If I was in my seventies, I'd be sayin', ""Hiya, doll...pour me a scotch"".  It really is a nice place inside, but it just screams ""1975 steak and cocktail house"".The service was much better this time.  The appetizers were fine, the bread was fine.  I got to try my very own pepper steak this year.  $35 for a nice steak, mashed potatoes and veggies.  For a place like this, it was not unreasonable.  It was quite good but certainly not a fine upper-end steak.The six of us got out for $430 with no coffee, no cocktails and no dessert.  It was a fine meal but nothing to drive more than 5 miles for.",0
2561,6191,"What a letdown.I treated some very good customers to a nice lunch here on their recommendation.  The parking lot was packed and we had to wait to get up to the valet parking.  Valet parking in Pico Rivera?  Really?It looked like an old bowling alley from the outside but it was very elegant inside, especially with the holiday decorations.  Very old world, mafia feel to it.It was packed with folks in suits and ladies in evening wear.  Lots of holiday parties, I guess.  The service just plain sucked.  The waitress was either clueless or too new to know what she was doing.  Our drink glasses were constantly empty, and I was brought the wrong meal....TWICE.  ""Sorry, hun, I grabbed the wrong plate and now it's gone.  Your new meal will take another 8 minutes.  Is that OK?""  Did I have a choice?  The second time, I told her to stick it.  My customers had a fine time and seemed to enjoy their pepper steaks.For a $32 entree, you can do WAY better than this old relic of the past.",0

2563,6193,dal rae is definitely a diamond in the ROUGH!

2564,6194,"*4.5 Stars*Like an uncontested champion the Dal Rae has staked its legendary status as one of the best Steakhouses in Los Angeles County for the better part of seven decades, watching the competition come and go in an unforgiving part of town.Everything about the Dal Rae harkens back to a different time and era, where customer service and comfort reigned supreme.  It's evident the moment you pull in and are greeted by the valet service.  The interior has retained its early to mid 20th century decor song with vintage high backed booths, total Rat Pack vibe here.  The food is top notch as they stock the Rolls Royce of ingredients here such as wild picked saffron and wild picked Black Forest truffles which is served as either an oil or butter depending on the entree.  You come here for the dry rub aged steaks and especially the grass fed organic Filet Mignon streaks, which are phenomenal when paired with said truffle butter, not the confusing prime rib which can be obtained anywhere. The house penne pasta with capers is also full flavored and highly recommended.  This is a great place for date night, impressing someone on a first date, or celebrating those special life moments with family and friends.  I came here for a business dinner and the clients were extremely impressed.",0
2565,6195,"Have been going to the Dal Rae now for 10 years, meaning totally amateur status for those in the Pico know. Love the owners, they are amazing and cater to your very whim. Lorin and Kevin know are the best and know how to make a foodie feel special. In the early days, I would order the blackened chicken breast sandwich, but of course one has to graduate to the steaks. Amazing. I was weary at first, but this place never fails to represent: the bisque, the relish tray :), and the hospitality. Bar none! This place feels like home.",1
2566,6196,"What a class operation this place is.  I'd heard about it for years and finally had the opportunity to go for dinner last Sat. night.  It was like a trip back in time to simple elegance blended with comfort and value.  Low lighting, white tablecloths, waitstaff in black and white, candlelit tables, a full piano bar and a fabulous extensive menu.  A complimentary relish tray (celery sticks, peppers and various other raw veggies on ice) and a pitcher of iced water is immediately brought to table, followed by crusty sourdough bread. I had a wonderful cocktail: the ""Dark and Stormy"" (a Moscow Mule with rum instead of vodka...delicious). My companion and I both had the halibut...his prepared Provençale stye and mine parmesan encrusted with a very subtle lemon sauce-delicious. Entree included baked potato and vegetables.  We opted to forego the Caesar salad prepared tableside so we'd have room for the Cherries Jubilee for dessert, which was flambe'd tableside and absolutely wonderful. The owner came by and spoke to us as he did to all the tables, some clearly filled with repeat customers such as my companion who frequently dined there over the years following a day at the Santa Anita race track, which is not far away.  The wait staff was top shelf as was the entire experience. Yes, it's pricey, but you get a good value for the money unlike so many newer,  more hip places where you get a fancy (and usually weird) entree on a giant plate that wouldn't fill up a the tummy of a small child. I will return to the Dal Rae for sure!",1
2567,6197,"Came here Saturday 12/15 with a group of 8 for a dinner.  The food here is always good but it seems when they are busy for the holidays they sacrifice quality in order to churn customers in and out (the place was packed).  We were running about 10 minutes late so called the restaurant about 45 minutes before our reservation to alert them, their response was kind of rude, basically threatening us with a lost reservation if we were over 15 minutes late.Overall the group liked the experience, the service was very good but the kitchen was a let down.  We started off with martini's at $17.50 each and mine was Belvedere with one olive and a twist.  They brought me Grey Goose with 2 olives and NO twist.  The cocktail waitress split before I could ask her to bring a twist and explain why I did not get the brand I ordered.  For a $20 drink you think they would have slowed things down a bit to get the order right.We brought a $100 bottle of our own wine and were charged $10 for a corkage, however their wine glasses were not rinsed well which gave the wine a soapy flavor... a wasted bottle of wine.  Ordered the wedge salad for $9.95 and that is what it was, a wedge of iceberg lettuce, salad dressing and a slice of thick bacon about 3"" long.  It could have been made much better with some diced red onion and tomato with the bacon chopped as well with some bleu cheese chunks tossed in.  My wife and I split the bone in rib eye ($52) which was cut in a very strange manner, the kitchen cut the meat off the bone for one plate and left the bone for the other plate.  Whoever cut this steak did not care about the customer that ordered it.  The 3/4"" thick steak also seemed thinner than previous visits here.  Well the baked potato was really good.With the rush, noise, and the high concentration of people, the ambiance was pretty low and the overall experience not what one would expect from a high end steak house.  For the money there are other choices.",0
2568,6198,Great service amazing cuisine.  Delicious garlic mashed potatoes and scallops.  Amazing garlic cheese bread,0
2569,6199,"Always great. The ingredients are all top notch and the service is excellent, even during special holiday events like New Years or the days leading up to Christmas. It's not in an area that one would expect to find a high end steak and seafood restaurant, but there it is. And when walking in it's like stepping back in time, in a good way. If you only dine out for special occasions Dal Rae should be in your rotation.",1
2570,6200,"There's only a few things to keep in mind when looking for a 5 star restaurant. First, look for restaurants that can set the bar high(pros and cons) .  Second, the prices will be competitive,Third the quality of food will be exceptional(taste,smell,sight). Finally, the customer service will rank high amongst the rest(from the time you walk into the restaurant until you leave the restaurant).Well ladies and gentlemen this is the restaurant.  Judge for yourself.",1

Our waiter checked on us just the right amount of time.We had the escargots as an appetizer.  We like them tender and very garlicky, and theirs are served exactly as we like them.We also decided to try table side warm bacon salad which was yummy. For our main entree, we had table side prepared Steak Diane which was fork tender and absolutely the best we've ever had.We shared the chocolate lava cake which was wonderful as well. We will definitely be back the next time we're in town.",0
2573,6203,Thank you Robert for the great service we received on Sunday night. We go every time for the Table side salad. You helped us make our dinner special by trying to get us items from the regular menu  thank you for that.  Our food was nice and hot. We will be back soon for your excellent service. Thank you,0
2574,6204,"I think probably my favorite steak house right now. Just thinking about that tender and juicy pepper steak is making my mouth water!Also, if you've never had escargot, this would be the place to try it. They are super buttery and tasty. If you've ever had the escargot at Savoy, but have been disappointed since they changed them, Dal Rae is the perfect substitute to fill that void in your life.Very pricey but very worth it. I would have given a 5th star if the piano lady would have let me sing my damn song. =D",1
2575,6205,"We weren't able to get a reservation for this place until nine, even when we called up and asked she said the bar was the only available spot. Then we found reservations on open table for 7:30. That was kind of frustrating, because obviously they sell a certain number of reservations to OpenTable. When we got there we ask her if we can be seated a little early, at that time it was only 6:30. Blonde receptionist at the front had quite an attitude when we asked her.But to our surprise she was able to get us a seat. But equally is surprising it was sitting with another couple at the same table! Yes, you read that right. While I was happy that she accommodated us, I think it would've been appropriate for her to have asked us if we wanted to sit with another couple. After all, it is very atypical. Even the other couples that were at the table were very surprised we sat with them. I almost thought it was a mistake.Just like a lot of old restaurants in the city the younger people are not treated the same as the Asian businessman an old white folk that go there.The tall bald white waiter was very staunch at first but then warmed up in the end.I used to come to these things for work and never realized, but the prices are outrageous. The Chilean sea bass is $37. But you do get a pretty reasonable portion I just would've liked to have had the mash potatoes on the same plate.My husband ordered the jumbo shrimp and it literally came in a wire basket like the garlic toast comes in, Rice on the side again. It hardly looked like a $24 meal.I think I'll stick to going here for free for work and go to a cheaper less crowded place with attitude.UPDATE: I have been meaning to write in the the mgr write me regarding this review. I find this very professional and would consider trying this place again.  Obviously they are concerned and hopefully will educate staff on customer service.",1
2576,6206,"My friend and I came here to try out the DineLA. I had never been here before, but it had great reviews. We came here for lunch and it wasn't too busy.When I drove up and checked the address, the outside décor reminded me of a Norm's Restaurant, but with valet. A little strange, but the inside of the restaurant is much better. It's a little dark when you first come in, but it's quiet and the décor is nice.Service was pretty good. Our server was very friendly, but I wouldn't say it was great service. I ordered off the DineLA lunch menu. I  ordered the stuffed mushrooms to start and the sirloin. The mushrooms (served with 2) were very good. A great balance of crab and hollandaise sauce. Unfortunately, I did not notice the sirloin would be served ground up, which I'm not a fan of, but it had a good flavor and the topping was delicious. I also ordered a martini to go with my lunch, but it had a hair in it, so I had to have a new one made. They apologized and brought a new one.It wasn't a great experience and I'm not sure I'd come back, but it was ok.",1
2577,6207,"Horrible customer service experience.Booked reservation on open table.com and couldn't be more disappointed. Arrived on time and was greeted by the rudest hostess ever. Was given a table we never asked for sitting with another couple we didn't know and when brought to her attention her reply was ""Don't talk to them""? This little kid lost a Christmas party and future business. Management wasn't much help. The only decent person here was the Valet attendant. This particular restaurant use to be a family favorite. Needless to say it's not anymore.Will let others know about The Dal Rae experience.",1
2578,6208,"Dal Rae is a can't miss if your visiting LA and looking for a great dining experience. DR is a throwback to a time when the customer always came first. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by name and wished a happy anniversary. The restaurant is small but classic in character. The dim lighting, wood paneling, and classy art work (some tasteful nudes at no extra charge!) put you in comfortable ease immediately. Piano bar took requests and the owner engaged us in a warm conversation.Pepper steak is delicious, but quite spicy. Cheese bread and relish tray are to die for. I'd give six stars if I could.",0
2579,6209,"OMG where do I start?I  have been going to this place since I was young (now lets just say that I am older...) and have ALWAYS been impressed by the quality of food and ambiance this place has to offer. The quality has never wavered. My personal preference is to have the mushrooms stuffed with crab, followed by a wilted spinach salad, then a main course of the one of a kind pepper steak (either filet or New York) with baked potato loaded with their Cheese sauce, and finish this perfect meal with a chocolate soufflé that is to die for... If you want the soufflé, then be sure to order it at the time you order your main course as it takes time to make. This combo is a perfect 10 in my book...This restaurant I have ordered almost everything on the menu at one time or another and have never been disappointed.If you read this Kevin, you need to open one in Orange County!!! If I lived closer I would be there weekly... at least....P.S. Good wine pairing for this would be a nice Pinot Noir up until the main course, then how about a nice Cabernet or Syrah? Sounds delicious!!!Hope this helps!!! Bon Appétit !",1
2580,6210,"I've come here for dinner numerous times, and it's always been fantastic in terms of both service and quality.  Don't pass on the pepper steak, the Caesar salad, the oysters Rockefeller, or a classic cocktail.  And if you call ahead, you might even get them to make one of the no-longer-on-the-menu appetizers, Clams Oreganada!Cheers!",0
2581,6211,"One of my buddy's first introduced me to this place in 2009 and ever since then, Dal Rae has been one of my favorite restaurants in all of L.A.! You have to try their crispy rock shrimp, and then their freshly made Caesar Salad (they make the dressing and toss the salad right in front of you). Caesar Salad has never tasted so good.They have some great steaks such as their Porterhouse and you definitely have to try their peppercorn steak as well.For dessert, you must have the Banana Flambe. They also make this fresh in front of you. It comes with almonds, ice cream, and of course bananas. Trust me, it's one of the best desserts you'll ever have. Enjoy!",0
2582,6212,"This is a destination restaraunt if you're in Los Angeles (county). A classic American steak house. One of a kind. Darkish, leather, updated & packed. There is a separate traditional bar, as well. Est 1951!There are really not enough words to praise the wonderful Mother's Day dinner for four.Our hubbies don't drink so my gal pal & I had the strongest & best Bombay gin/tonic ever. Short in stature, but long in all else! The breadbasket was plentiful w/ delicious wheat sourdough, spicy cracker bread & traditional wrapped breadsticks. Next came a large dish of fried calamari w/ two sauces which was done to perfection. Then I had the iceburg wedge w/ classic blue cheese dressing. (Next time I would try the creamy blue.)Our entrees were delish & the most tender medallions of beef, Pepper New York steak (their specialty), rack of lamb & shrimp scampi. The asparagus' were as large as I've seen, not over done. The boys had garlic mashers which they both said were the best they've had.We split a Marsala soaked Tiramisu & Creme Brûlée to finish our wonderful dinner experience.Don't miss this gem. You won't be sorry.",0

Some of the best crab cakes I've had on West Coast. It's full of sweet lump crab, a good crispy exterior and very tasty sauce. The Rockefeller was excellent as well, I could've eaten all six by myself.. The scallops are really good and well worth the money!  We were celebrating, so I had the surf and turf, of a petite filet pepper steak and the Chilean Sea bass Alla Ben.The pepper steak was excellent Prime beef cooked perfect!What can I say about the Sea Bass, if you haven't had it you've truly missed one of the great culinary experiences!My dinner companions had the sea bass with a piccata sauce, and the veal chop; both reported they thoroughly enjoyed them.Dessert was Cherries Jubilee and Tiramisu which we shared.The Cherries Jubilee was good, but not a strong enough brandy flavor, and a little skimpy on the cherries. The tiramisu was one of the best!The service is excellent, but a little casual for the price point. It was more like something I expect at lunchtime, but overall Dal Rae is a solid 4.5 and many times a 5-star experience.",0

So called over rated ""pepper steak"" arrived cold. My guests fish was overcooked..crumbling. Very pricey and bland. Really good food is getting harder & harder to find in the U.S.I would rate this place a big fat ""F"" to any regular bistro in Paris.Never again...It's a shame that the majority of the people in this country have no clue to what fine dining is.",0

2590,6220,"Usually celebrate special occasions at the Dal Rae but found going between Christmas and New Year was a disappointment.  It is too busy to justify spending the money. My whole dinner was cold, rice pilaf, king crab legs and wilted spinach salad was cold even though the heated bacon dressing is usually warmed at table side.  This time it was done in the kitchen and came out cold. My husbands filet mignon was ordered medium and was served rare and also cold.  His wilted spinach salad, made in the kitchen was also cold. Service was not good as it normally is. Our waitress was slow, set our entre down and did not come back to see if all was well. We should have returned our food but gave up on her.  Our bill-- $179.35 which included one glass of house Chardonnay and a tap beer.  Plus valet parking $4.50 plus tip. Will shop for a different ""special celebration"" restaurant.",0

2592,6222,"Normally love this place.  Have been going off and off for a few years - i always rave about the food, drinks and service. Decided on a New Years Eve to try a nice chill and elegant dinner - with some chill music. Supposedly what the Dal Rae offered. Made reservations for husband and another couple.  We were prepared to spend $200 per couple - even with the limited menu - no worries.Like the reviewer before me who went there to celebrate her anniversary - I was very disappointed to see the SMALL print of the ""There will be a $20.00 per person cover charge for anyone seated after 6:30 pm.""  I agree with her - what for? The lame hats & noise makers? And we had to ASK FOR THEM.  $80 for paper hats? I agree that should have been brought up when I made my reservation several weeks back.  I think thats sneaky and and I am docking them 2 stars for it.  Come on! The Dal Rae is better than this! Just because your in Pico doesn't mean you have to be sneaky and ghetto - Play nice next time and be up front.  With a 9 pm rez we really had no option but to accept the charge -  stay and eat there. I was really disappointed and the other couple was too - it was their first time at the Dal Rae.  Food was solid - oysters rockafeller, crab cakes, prime ribs and lamb.  Champagne cocktail - yummy.  The service - meh, just ok.  Overall, it was too bad, it could have been a much nicer experience.",0
2593,6223,"nice place with a fancy dim divey bar vibeEasy to find with the big sign outside.  Being a fancy restaurant, it's almost automatic you gotta have valet serviceWalking in you hear music from Frank Sinatra and similar music from that genre, kinda reminds me of VegasI started at the bar, I decided I wanted an old fashion, unfortunately probably the worse one I've ever ordered anywhere.  Club soda, makers, some orange color, and cherry is not an old fashion.  If you're going to charge $11.50 for it make it right.  Since I had a large party attending I didn't want to start off negatively by sending drinks back.  I'll stick to a James and Ginger next time.  I don't know if it was the large parties in the restaurant as it seemed to have several parties of 5 or 8 or 10 or more etc in various areas which made the ordering and service times so long.  I don't know because of those large parties that there was going to be a wait but  I think we waited for almost 30-40 mins or so before we got our food,  I didn't mind as we were in good company.  I had the 16oz Prime New York pepper steak med rare garnished with asparagus along with garlic mash and 3 cheese macaroni.  The pepper steak was cooked as requested and tasted delicious dressed with green onions peppercorn bacon mixture which i'll admit i've never had before and is deliciously interesting.  The garlic mash was ok and the The 3 cheese mac and cheese also ok but on the dry side.My sister had the Chilean Seabass, which is was cooked perfect.  it wasn't dry and the flavor was pretty good.  I wouldn't mind ordering that next time.The baked brie cheese with pesto was new to me and pretty good too.  The Ahi sashimi on toast with Wild Greens. Capers. Onion, Feta Cheese and Remoulade and some wasabi was pretty good texture.The complimentary garlic cheese toast was also nice.The banana flambe cooked table side is a nice touch, the gentleman who cooked it was in a very nice suit which was very interesting.  Overall the place is great.  The service is good, the food is delicious and the atmosphere will make any occasion special for sure.Notablesthey have a bar with tvs in the front dining areaThey serve a 38oz ribeye tomahawk chop for $86 ( Mastros is $100)out door patiobanana flambe is entertaining esp when the flame shoots upValet service",0

2596,6226,Great experience at Dal Rae. I was a bit skeptical based off some of the pictures and reviews left. Nothing but good things had been mentioned about  the food from friends so I had to try it myself. From walking in the environment is a cultural time warp. Old decor with beautiful holiday lighting. The booths are half rounds as to display decor and staff. The number one thing they are known for is the Dal Rae peppered steak. It gives the steak a great crispness to the top. If you don't like spicy I'd suggest to have them lighten the seasoning. Towards the end the pepper catches up to you. Not overwhelming just enough kick. The meal comes with veggies and a side of your choosing. To finish off your dining they have a delicious assortment of desserts. The creme brûlée had a nice bite with the torched sugar on top. Overall I enjoyed my entire experience at this restaurant. We also finish our desserts with after dessert desserts of cocktails. Cucumber mojitos were light and refreshing.,0
2597,6227,"I'm a fan of this old time special place.Appetizers: crab stuffed scallops (okay, lacked flavor)escargot (good, nothing to compare it to)calamari (typical flavor and fried to a crisp)brie with pesto (um, delish)the veggie tray.. the pickles were dream worthy (and I hate pickles)Main course..

You can have your Ruth's Chris, you can have your Morton's and Mastro's....Dal Rae is old school epic steak house!I was a guest of an old colleague, we had gotten together with a small group who used to work together to catch up.  I was pleasantly surprised by this old school, dark steakhouse with black leather booths and waiters dressed up and trained EXTREMELY well!We shared a bunch of appetizers, steamed clams, tuna sashimi and perhaps the largest shrimp cocktail known to man!!!  All the appetizers were excellent especially the ENORMOUS shrimp!!!!  My colleagues went all ""Mad Men"" and ordered martinis....the martinis were like the shrimp...GIANT!!!!We all ordered something different for the entrees and shared.  We had ordered the Wagyu, the pepper filet, the salmon in lemon butter and the shrimp scampi.  Every single entree was outstanding....I really, really liked the pepper steak and wagyu!!!!I wish there was a Dal Rae closer to me....there is no doubt I would frequent it ALOT!

It was the best fish dish I have ever had. Servers work very hard here as they a lot of table side preparation. They bring out chilled veggies and a bread basket.

2610,6240,"Read the reviews, I think some are kinda overboard about this place. The decor is indeed nice but seriously forced PAID valet parking for it? It's not that nice. Inside is dim but I found the atmosphere kinda lost. For whatever reason it really lacked a ""theme"" or feel to it. Just nice wood on the walls, highback chairs and relatively okay service. Could have been the night we went but the customers around us were in shorts, Monster drink hats and had kids playing on their Nintendo's with the music on. Babies crying, cramped space and the noise all brought this place down a few notches in my book.As for the food, I had the much written about Peppered Steak and it was just okay. Good, not great. Definitely not $38 great by any means. Had some Mac & Cheese, some garlic mash and I thought it was again good, just not great. What was pretty good was the Calamari. The serving is huge so just pace yourself as you might fill up to fast. Over all we likely will not be back, the valet thing is kinda offensive and the food just does not meet the expectations.For those who might wonder where I would suggestCalamari - Fritto Misto in LA.Mac & Cheese - Smith & Wolenski in VegasSteak - Smith & Wolenski in Vegas",0
2611,6241,"Did I step out of a time machine and end up in the 1960s? Don Draper, is that you drinking a scotch while you lie back in one of the plush booths of Dal Rae.We started with the calamari, which I'm happy to say was a very large portion, so large that my BF and I had to bring some home because we could not in good heart finish it otheriwse we would be full for dinner. The buttersauce, delicious but better on the bread than the calamari. The homemade chunky marinara? Magnifico@ I had the petite peppercorn filet mignon for dinner and my goodness that is peppery deliciousness. It was tender, it was moist, they actually prepared it medium rare and it just kind of melts in your mouth. I opted for the baked potato and they're not kidding about giving you chives. I mean these are some fresh, succulent chives. I didn't even know I liked chives until I had it on that potato.So, it's a fantatstic place for a romantic date, the food is tres bien and the service was just spot on. No course overlap, and friendly wait staff who work together. What's not to love. Oh yeah, and the bar in the front looks absolutely amazing. I hope to come back real soon.",0

When I asked for the lady I was referred to she seemed extremely bothered. Wow! This place is NOT cheap so I would expect a nice cordial staff. NOT!!!

She brought our drinks and said she would be back again she took a while. We had asked her several times for bread and relish and she kept forgetting to bring it. She finally brought the bread and forgot again the relish. She then brought the relish. We order the Chateaubriand Double Cut, the meat was under season and so were the potatoes.

2615,6245,"Made a trip for DineLA and was very pleased with the experience.If coming for DineLA - ask what the soup is. I was able to get a Tomato Basil soup that turned out great. Went very well with the cheese bread they give.The cheese bread is great. I worked at a place that did something very similar and had missed it. Great to see that other places make a similar type of cheese bread.I asked for the Pepper Filet with a baked potato with butter, chives, and sour cream. The baked potato is great! Once I got the potato the butter was nicely melted and was very easy for me to mix it all up and enjoy. The Pepper Filet is tricky. It's going to be a like or dislike situation for most people. I personally disliked the pepper toppings as it was getting too spicy for my taste. My friend really enjoyed it though, didn't even leave a scrap left. He actually asked if I didn't like the toppings which I commented that it was too spicy for my taste.I think the best option for dessert is the sundae. The creme brulee was okay, nothing special enough to rave about. Friends enjoyed the Sundae, that seemed to be the best option of the three.I am not a fan of their half circle booths. It's very cramped and not pleasant to be sitting on the inside.",0

2622,6252,"I went to Dal Rae for the first time about a month ago as the first stop on a date night with my girlfriend.  It came highly recommended to me by a friend and I have to say, I was very impressed.  The place has a very old-timey sort of feel to it.  Dimly lit with wood paneling and leather booths all around.  It looks almost as if you could expect Don Draper to pop in at any moment for a steak and an old-fashioned.Speaking of steaks and drinks, Dal Rae's famous pepper steak (which I had) was delicious as was the filet mignon my girlfriend had.  Both were cooked perfectly to order and full of flavor.  Oh!  Don't pass up an opportunity to get a boat of their garlic mashed potatoes, they were damn near the best I've ever had.  We also had a plate of oysters (my first time) which my girlfriend claimed were some of the best she's had.  She lived in Japan for two years so I saw that as some fairly high praise.  All told, the food although a bit pricey, was easily 5 star and worth the price.The service was also excellent.  The waiters were attentive but not intrusive.  Actually, I'm not sure if this was the owner/manager or what (he carried himself like it), but a somewhat older gentleman made his way around to most of the booths to chat briefly with the guests to ask how we were doing and make sure everything was going well.  It felt very sincere and was another nice touch on top of an already pleasant experience.The only other thing that I'd like to clarify about the place is the dress code.  I was a little unsure of what was appropriate as I heard some very conflicting comments on it but it was mostly business casual and even then it seemed a little lax.  The crowd on a Saturday night seemed to skew a bit older so what I saw was mostly khakis and polo shirts on men.  However there were a few people who dressed up a little more, myself included, and didn't seem too out of place.  But again, if you bring a jacket and tie be prepared to be in the minority.Overall we had a great experience and I would recommend this to others just as it was to me.",0
2623,6253,This gem has been around for a very long time. I highly recommend it for special occasions. The food selection is great the service was very attentive and the ambiance was warm and full of cheer. We even requested the desert off the holiday menu and the chef made it for us.,0
2624,6254,"Chilean Sea Bass, Crab Cakes and Cherries Jubilee were amazing!!! The atmosphere is very old school feeling in a good way. Service is great, excellent experience overall!! Will be coming again soon.",1
2625,6255,Hidden gem. Great place for steak.Valet parking only for minimal cost.Highly recommend reservations. Great wine list and I believe they offer bottle service. We had an 8pm reservation and were seated right away. Everything was perfectly cooked.,0
2626,6256,"This place never disappoints! I had their pepper filet mignon, garlic mashed potatoes, and a glass of wine. Creme Brule for dessert was amazing. Fantastic service and great music playing in the bar area.",0
2627,6257,"Just came home after visiting an old friend. That friend is the Dal Rae in Pico Rivera. So good and comforting to get back to the Dal. This was their first Saturday back since closing in March. They closed 2 days prior to my wife's bday on St. Patrick's Day so this was a long awaited bday celebration. Lydia our server was superb. She greeted us and made us feel right at home. Friendly accommodating demeanor. In fact every staff member we came in contact with were very friendly and attentive. Our meals were delicious as usual. I enjoyed the 8oz. Filet mignon with Bernaise sauce, my wife had the Sea Bass. Both meals were spot on. Delicious warm garlic bread preceded by a cool crisp plate of pickles, peppers n other veggies and a basket of fresh crackers of different varieties. We capped off our meals with fresh lemon cello flutes for dessert. What a good feeling to come back to an old friend. Thank you Dal Rae. We missed you.",0
2628,6258,"I've been coming here since I was in diapers. Seriously. I used to sit on top of the piano with my favorite pink dress and white tights playing the tambourine. Seriously.Over the years the owners have become friends to our family. I'm 25 now, and still stop by here when I'm in town. I've had my graduation parties here and family birthday celebrations.I'll be honest as a kid I didn't like the place. I only liked the lobster, the piano player, and the bartender that put 5 cherries in my shirley temples. Now?Well now, I like the prime rib and the steaks and still the lobster. My shirley temples have been upgraded to Jack and cokes which are good, and sometimes the bartender will still give me my cherries.Get the chopped salad. It's amazing, and I've never had a chopped salad elsewhere that was nearly as good.Oh!And the flourless chocolate cake!",1
2629,6259,"The restaurant was ok. The hostess was really rude (in my opinion). They have a live piano bar for you to get a drink while waiting for your table. The food was ok, but very big portion, I think it's worth the price.",1
2630,6260,"Great ambience, and the best pepper steak I've had. Added bonus: you'll dine in the setting of a scene from Good Felllas.",0
2631,6261,Ok just walked out. Made reservations for two special occasions and they sat us in the patio. When we spoke to the manager she said that all tables inside were utilized..  sad to say they were not. We saw 2 empty tables when we exited the restaurant. Then when valet brought out my car he said he doesn't have the key. My husband stated you gave me the ticket and I gave you the key. I'm The valet stated don't lie you didn't give me the key. My son stated check your pockets and low and behold the valet had my key to my car.   Idiot the car won't start without the key. Ugh!!  So very disappointed!!!,0
2632,6262,A great place to go for business dinner.  The menu incredible.  Quite a selection  of beef  and pork and surf and turf and if you are looking for a good steak look no further.  Great ambience.  Very old style place and been there for years.     A bit on the pricey side but worth it.  Highly recommend.,0
2633,6263,I attended Dal Rae for dinner. Food was amazing and service was 5 stars!The ambiance was mellow and romantic. Loved the fact they had live performers playing music. I'll definitely be going back to get a better feel of the place.,1
2634,6264,"Definitely one of my favorite places for a nice night out. It's off the beaten path and has a real old time feel. Great steaks, seafood, and martinis. However, the real gems here are the comp cheese bread and table-side Caesar salad. Mmmmmmm....I settled on four stars because they have a difficult time managing their reservations. It's always a good 30 min wait after you arrive for a res. Service can be lacking as well but it's all part of the experience.",0
2635,6265,"If I can give a million more stars I totally would. I'm still high off the happiness of how delicious this place was. Looking at it from the outside you would never think this place was so delicious. Service was great, ambiance was nice and calm. I loved that I didn't see one soul on their phones. I ordered the petit peppered filet and oh gracious me was it beyond delicious! Like god damn god damn how have I not had this before!? I savored every piece of that delicious steak. I have so much more to say but as I type this I am laying down in a food coma half asleep so long story short, just f***ing eat here and get the peppered filet!",1
2636,6266,"This place is a hidden gem in PICO RIVERA. I would always drive by it going to work. I always thought it was a diner that senior citizens would go to for dinner. My boyfriend apparently had this bookmarked for a while. It is on the pricey side. Luckily for us, it's part of the whole DineLA thing so we got a 3 course meal for $50. It was great. I got the mushroom stuffed with lump crab meat, Chilean sea bass, and the crème brûlée. Ohh mahh gawd! It was all so so good. There were only two mushrooms but it's all you really need. You think you want more but you have to remember that you have the Chilean sea bass AND dessert. The sea bass was perfect. A meaty white fish with THE perfect sear. By the time the crème brûlée came I was definitely way too full. I only had half. My boyfriend had the fried zucchini, filet mignon, and the gold brick sundae. The filet mignon portion was HUGE and so freaking delicious. The sundae was insanely good. We both had the mashed potatoes for our side. It was amazingly smooth and went well w our entrees. I'm crying this place was so good and in PICO! Of all places.",0
2637,6267,"We went there Saturday night for a birthday dinner. We sat at the bar which was full and good energy. Nice music from the piano, it was great. After that we went to the main dining room for dinner. Again the place was packed! The service was one of the best I've experienced. All the staff are friendly and genuinely nice. The food was great as well. This restaurant is on the expensive side but well worth it.",0
2638,6268,"OH MY GAWD OH MY GAWD OH MY GAWD BEST EFFING MEAL EVVVERRRRR !!! Chilean sea bass melted in my mouth soooo buttery sooooo flavorful sooooo deeeeeelicious!!!!!! Why I waited 41 years to try this place blows my mind!!! I'm an idiot for never eating here before!!!! Going back asap!!! Forgot to mention the almond crusted goat cheese salad was sooo damn delicious that my friend & I stopped talking / conversing for 10 minutes straight ! all we could muster was ""Mmmmmmmmm"" in between swallows! She took me here for a belated birthday celebration my waitress was so sweet too she looks like Demi Lovato! I wish I could remember her name but the Malbec got to me!!! Sorry! Excellent service excellent food!!!!",0
2639,6269,Cant believe they remodeled the bar area - Retro is gone what a shame!!  No piano player and they said because it was the holidays no cherries Jubeliee or Banana Foster - what a huge disappointment - also we ordered the ceasar salad which is normally prepared table side - never even saw them make it -at $90 a person I would expect more -service was great,1
2640,6270,Great classic restaurant !!! The bananas foster is a must. Also great lounge bar too.,1
2641,6271,"I always have a good time with my partner, no matter where we go. I have a wonderful valentines date with the love of my life, which we needed because we haven't gone out in a very long time (5month old baby.) The woman serving us was very forgetful, kind of a smart Ass and of course the restaurant ran out of everything we wanted even though we ordered all we wanted ahead of time and lots of people got the same deserts we ordered ahead of time. It sucks mostly because we were there for about 5 hours (NOT BY CHOICE). We wanted to have a nice dinner for about an hour and a half or 2 hours at most and enjoy the rest of our evening... ya know.... ""Valentines nighting"" since we had the baby with grandma for another 3 hours. Our waitress was extremely slow and we waited about 45 mins to finally be asked what we would like to drink (I can promise you this is not an exaggeration.) Perhaps we picked the wrong day to go on a fancy date, but I mean... c'mon. What's a romantic restaurant there for then? Horrible service, great company. My night was still awesome.... but this place was not.",0
2642,6272,"Wow my Nina took my husband and me out, this was the first time for us to come try this place and may I just say I can't wait to come back and enjoy the Chilean sea bass and baked potato. The flavors worked so amazing and they staff was great. When we came they were very busy but tried there best to get to everyone. I look forward to going back and try something new. The prices where higher then what we expected but it was worth the money. I'd only come here on a special occasion through.",0
2643,6273,"Excellent food, and the best Customer Service. Rat Pack type of vibe.  A great crowd pleaser.",1
2644,6274,Crowded on a Thursday night! Thank goodness I set reservations. Food was great and service was excellent. I will definitely come back again!,0
2645,6275,"This place is excellent! I know about this place because my dad comes here with his customers and all the Commerce Casino gamblers come here as well.The Chilean Sea Bass with the lemon butter sauce is SO soft, juicy, and tender. NOBODY makes a Chilean Sea Bass like the way they do! Their garlic mashed potatoes and oysters are also good. The Prime Rib, as I was told, resembled that of Lawry's.The decor of this restaurant is definitely themed around the 50s. The outside looks like a Norms restaurant. lol. But anyways, definitely good!",0
2646,6276,My favorite birthday restaurant! Love it here. Cesar Salad plus Lobster Thermidor excellent!!! Service is awesome. Always enjoy our meals.,0
2647,6277,"Came to the Dal Rae at a corporate event in their party room. The space is reminiscent of an old favorite memory from a place you'd been to 20 years ago, yet current in many ways.Excellent Filet Mignon steak prepared perfectly to my liking and accompanied with peppers and baked potato and paired with a quality Sonoma Merlot.  House salad was crisp and complimented well with fresh raspberry. Creme Brûlée was an excellent finish to a wonderful meal,Our wait staff was attentive and pleasant. An excellent first dinner on this my first visit to LA, would definitely return!",0
2648,6278,"Mixed emotions. I know it's Valentine's, but 1 1/2 hrs. to get our meals, and 1/2 hr. minimum to get a drink? Ordered Prime Rib and Lobster. It was ok. Service from our Waiter was good. But definitely will be a long time before I come back, maybe. Clearman's Steak & Stein better service even in special days.  Honest truth. Very disappointed.",1
2649,6279,"Service is always very good. $6 valet parking only. Steaks are usually great, and fish is mostly good, however, the Abalone was served fried with batter - if your chef does not know how to properly prepare a delicacy, do not allow it on the menu as it sours your good reputation.",0
2650,6280,"Love a classic restaurant.  The owners have done a nice job of maintaining and updating where necessary.  Very nice and comfortable booths and tables.  Everything we tried was delicious.  Love the relish tray that is brought out with the bread and butter.  We then had the Oysters Rockefeller as an appetizier and a Caesars salad that was made table side.  They take their table side productions seriously.  I appreciate that.  The salad dressing is tasty and includes a raw egg yolk and anchovies.    They also give you cheese toast.  Haven't had it in a while.  It was a nice addition.  We had peppered Filet Mignon.  Tender, flavorful and cooked rare, as requested.  For dessert, strawberries with Grand Marnier chocolate sauce.  We left very happy that we finally made it out there and had such a pleasurable meal.  They have  a nice wine list, too.Service was very friendly and attentive.We'll definitely be back and would highly recommend it.",0
2651,6281,"If you like throw back steak houses like Musso & Franks, you'll definitely enjoy the dining experience at Dal Rae. From the moment you enter live classics are being sung at the piano bar. There is a dimly lit dining room. For starters, I recommend Rockefeller Oysters or a Caesar Salad tossed at your table side. You will be delighted with any beef item on the menu (e.g. prime rib, filet mignon or a ribeye.) They also have poultry and seafood items to choose from. Sorry, can't comment on desert as I was too stuffed!",0
2652,6282,"This restaurant is my husbands favorite spot. We even came out on Valentine's Day and were still able to get a table with little to no wait. We did make a reservation, so that is highly recommended. The rib eye there was so good. I had the lobster thermidor, and Dal Rae is one of the few places in LA that serves that, and let me tell you it was delicious.",0
2653,6283,"Food was fine service was good, but this is another place where they have converted a patio to year round dining, and while this isn't the arctic or the Sahara desert you can never completely control the temperature in an area that is supposed to be outdoors. We were there for a work related celebration and they sat our large party in this modified patio where it was extremely warm and noisier that it should be.",1
2654,6284,"Well let's start at the beginning walked in and immediately the hostess had a sour face as if we were inconveniencing her. After waiting I noticed the crowd was older I would guess 45 & up. There were some younger people but only at the bar. After waiting some more we were finally seated, so we thought until the waitress turned us around and said the table wasn't ready and then back to waiting. Finally get seated waitress was okay, until she burned whatever she was cooking next to us and smoke billowed through the dinning area. The place was packed and there is no room between tables everything was just cramped, your bobbing, weaving and dodging patrons just to get to and from the table. Lastly and most importantly the food I had pepper filet minion and it had zero flavor and I mean zero. Save yourself the time, I heard good things but was seriously left disappointed.",0
2655,6285,"Oh damn this place is great. Old time steak house with dim lighting, strong drinks and a damn good steak. Pepper steak is their go to, Chilean sea bass is great. Ahi tuna also great. Do yourself a favor and grab dinner at the Del Rae, you won't be disappointed",0
2656,6286,"That old school vibe of Rat Pack era is alive in this place, I recomend reservations especially in the weekend. The jazz piano player is awesome",1
2657,6287,Awesome interior spiffed you for the holidays.  Had their signature pepper filet which was good but not knock your socks off good.  Also had the French onion soup which I thought was mediocre.  Great job by the wait staff keeping our party of 16 satisfied from the drinks and pace of food standpoint.  Would definitely come back.,0
2658,6288,"Although I've been here a few times before, I've never gotten around to writing a review.I was here again yesterday for my birthday, and not only did I have the most delicious prime rib dinner, but our service was excellent.We started out with the complimentary relish tray and bread basket. The only gripe about that was the the butter was still hard and we couldn't spread it on the bread.  We had the crab stuffed mushrooms - which I highly recommend.I had the prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes. The beef was juicy, delicious, cooked to rare perfection and every bite melted in my mouth. The mashed potatoes were thick and rustic, and very flavorful.  The chocolate birthday cake was a nice touch, but we also ordered the chocolate soufflé. DECADENT! definitely a must!",0
2659,6289,"Determined to visit somewhere neither of us have ever gone to, we decided to visit Dal Rae because 1) we drove past it one day and knew where it was, and 2) the reviews on Yelp weren't bad.Keep in mind that it is valet parking only in their lot ($3.50). There's also a dress code. We were in street clothes but the hostess let us anyways. Walking into Dal Rae, I felt as I have stepped into a movie. It was very surreal. For one, the patrons were of a very 'mixed' variety which I wasn't expecting given the Pico Rivera location. There were huge parties of what seemed like company gatherings where everyone was in their business attire. There were also some 60/40 crowds. We stuck out like sore thumbs.The food was pretty delicious. They provided free bread, garlic bread, and a tray of vegetables to munch on pre-meal. I ordered the fillet Mignon with shitake mushrooms and my friend ordered the pork chops. Both were very delicious and filling. The prices are a bit pricey but honestly in comparison to any steak house prices, they're decent.",1
2660,6290,"We had reservations at 4 and got seated pretty quickly . We were sat down and shortly given some water. The water tasted extremely salty ! On top of that there was a Pasta noodle in our water container for refills. We had the Waitress taste it and she immediately spited it out . Staff came back and proceeded to inform us that"" there filter needed to be changed"" instead of offering alternatives Dawns response was "" we're going to do it like Mexico and drink beer "" completely unprofessional and inappropriate not to mention when she came to our table her introduction was "" oh your server left for the night so I'm here "" then a while later we were hitWith  "" my shift is over for night so Dora is now your sever "" 2 hours later the manger Gabriel finally showed himself asked how we were doing once we told him about the water he offers us bottles Evian . Really? Dora did helped with some customer service recovery  ! We were sent a server to come ask us how many boxes we needed when we weren't even done ! This is only half the story . Food was good only reason why 2 stars !!",0
2661,6291,"I just want to say that I was considering ordering 10 dinner entrees from here. However, when calling to ask a simple question the staff member was EXTREMELY rude. Later, someone else I know called to place the order over the phone and they were rude to her as well. Safe to say, we will not be spending our money here.",1
2662,6292,Very disappointing. We have a holiday lunch and every year and the food is exceptional. However they evidently have a smoking patio right outside with no filtration system and every time the door opens smoke permeates the entire place. By the time I left there after two and a half hours I could barely breathe my voice was raspy and my eyes were burning. Ruined the whole lunch,0
2663,6293,Never been here and will never come again.  Place is probably racist.  Came in to place an order to go.  I asked the hostess if i could do that. She said yes and to have a seat that she will get a waitress to help me. Im sitting there no drinks no menu for 20 minutes while 2 different waitress walk by and the hostess just standing there knowing im waiting.  Meanwhile any white people that came in were helped immediately and the hostess even spent minutes chit chatting with one while im still waiting.,0
2664,6294,The finest!!!never disappointed. Best food and drinks. Try the table side Cesar salad made right in front of you.Service is #1!,0
2665,6295,"Special Place, Special Occasion, so we'll go back to the F.A.V.E. scale for this review, recommended by one of my wife's co-workers so we decided to go for our 31st wedding anniversary, if you like beef, this is the place to go for your special occasion.Food - They are famous for the beef so when in Pico Rivera, this is the place to find it, we made a  reservation for 5pm and arrived a few minutes early, the hostess lead us to a nice big booth, our waitress Nancy showed up and took our drink order and returned quickly with a relish tray and a big basket of assorted breads, if you are a fan of little butter pats between two pieces of paper you will immediately find something to complain about, because they don't have those here, your bread will come with ¼ of a stick of butter, yes a stick of butter slices lengthwise and put on a plate just for your table. After perusing the menu for about 10 minutes (because there is so much to choose from) we finally made our selections, Calamari, French Onion Soup, Regular Cut prime rib for the wife and Diamond Jim Brady Cut for me, finished off with a Grand Marnier soufflé.Our drinks arrived and they brought a carafe of water so you could refill your own glass and not have to flag down the waitress ( huge plus for me) Wife had an apple martini and was very pleased with the taste, The wait for our Calamari was not very long at all, just enough time to try a couple of pieces of bread and then we know we are in trouble because the platter of Calamari is huge, enough for 4 or 5 people at least, very nicely done Nancy then brings us some garlic toast which was fantastic, moving on to the French onion soup, one of the best we have had, no real need to say much more, by this time we are getting full and then the beef arrives, wife's was unveiled first and she almost fainted, the slab of beef was huge, then Nancy said ""wait to you see his"" I think, ""be afraid, be very afraid"" would have been more appropriate, as Nancy takes the cover off my plate I stare in awe at the almost 4 inch thick piece of American beef......., it didn't quite fill the plate but only because they have large plates, enough for a small family of 4 to feast on and not walk away hungry. At this time, Nancy informs us that they can make us a soufflé but they take about 30 minutes, being that we love soufflé we decide to order one, take a couple of bites of the prime rib, eat some of our potatoes and asparagus and then decide to wait for our soufflé to arrive. A few minutes later it arrives with a vanilla sauce and fresh whipped cream, piping hot, small but we devour it, this was the only dish we finished all night, not because we didn't try but because there was so much food.A Recap in order of AppearanceBread & Relish DishApple Martini and Water with our own personal carafeFrench Onion Soup & Garlic ToastRegular & Diamond Jim Brady Cuts of Prime Rib Medium RareFree Chocolate Cake for our AnniversarySouffléAtmosphereIt's an older building that has had some recent remodeling, the dining room is fresh but retains that midcentury charm, dark woods, cork ceiling tiles and vintage lighting beautiful building for that special meal, just stepping though the door takes you back in time. If you like going back to fine dining like it used to be then this is one of your can't miss places.ValueValue is relative, if you are looking for cheap food then this is not the place for you, if you are looking for a great meal and getting what you paid for then you will be happy here, Dinner, Drinks with appetizers and desserts can run you between $30 and $100 per person but you will get a fantastic meal, and value for your money.ExperienceSome of the yelpers complained about the service, unfriendly staff and valet parking, from the moment we dropped the car at the valet, until the moment we picked it up again 2 hours later this was one of the best dinning experiences we've had in a long time.  I'm not a real big fan of valets and it's not about the cost, I've see Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I know what the valets do with my car but since I left the Ferrari at home, I figured the Toyota would be ok with the valet and it's only $3.50 for parking, so get over it let the valet park your car and stop complaining about things that don't matter. Secondly the hostess, show up for a 5pm reservation , she is friendly & attentive , leads us right to our table, then there is Nancy, couldn't ask for a better waitress, the bus staff was also supper friendly and attentive, as well, Finally the suits, two of them, walking the floor checking on people and occasionally making a salad tableside, nothing classes a place up like the bosses walking the floor making sure that everyone is having an outstanding experience, so from the beginning until the end nothing but a 5 star evening for the wife and I.Highly recommend for that special evening or when you are really hungry",0
2666,6296,"This is actually my second time dining here, both for DineLA events.  I never got around to writing a review for my first visit, however.  The place has a definitely ""Godfather"" type of feel to it as it is very dark with leather booths.  Service was excellent, but the food was average.  I got the crabcake, which was good but very tiny, the Steak Diane (too peppery for my taste, though it was very tender), and the Tiramisu (which I think must contain real coffee as I could not fall asleep all night).  My friend ordered off the menu, opting for the French Onion soup and the Mahi Mahi, which she liked.  I didn't try the fish myself.I liked that they give every table some raw veggies on ice as well as different types of breads.  The DineLA is a great deal for $35 since I think the steak normally costs almost that much alone, though I'm not sure if the portions are the same.",0
2667,6297,"Time capsule! What an awesome place, from the service, setting, drinks, and cuisine... it's all worth it and a wonderful experience!",0
2668,6298,We had a private party in their Garden Room for ~ 28 guests. Everything was perfect and they were very easy to work with. Julie helped me coordinate the details. The room set up was great and the staff (Jennifer and Jackie) were Awesome!!!! If you have a party here definitely request these two ladies!! Food was tasty as always. I highly recommend Dal Rae for any occasion!,0
2669,6299,The sea bass is amazing! The baked potatoes and mashed potatoes were so good as well. And the vanilla bean ice cream dessert was so delicious. The place is beautiful inside. Definitely the place to go for a nice romantic dinner. Very elegant.,1
2670,6300,"Score based on 3 visits in the past 2 months:    Food:  3.8   Service:  2I've been going to the Dal Rae, mostly for lunch, for over 10 years, and I'm sad to say that I've found the service in the past few months to have deteriorated quite a bit.  Yesterday was a case in point:  from the time we were seated until the time we got the bill was more than 2 hours.  For lunch ..!!.    Part of the reason was that it took more than 30 minutes to even get our orders taken, in a restaurant that was no more than 1/2 full.  Sure, people can appreciate a leisurely lunch, but the Dal Rae seems to have moved past that into a zone of glacial slowness.  And this was faster than lunch a few months ago, which took close to 3 hours.  Also yesterday, we had plenty of botched orders:  one diner's soup never was delivered.  2 diners who asked for something other than mashed potatoes got mashed potatoes.  In all cases, the waitress blamed the kitchen, but isn't it her responsibility to take a look at the ticket and the plate, and then tell the kitchen they've goofed up?  This waitress, like one a few visits ago, wasn't around enough and doesn't really know that good service is more than just calling everyone ""honey.""It was an hour after we arrived before we got our entrees, and after those (with all the mistakes) were cleared, it was easily another 20 minutes or so before she asked if we wanted dessert.  By the time we got the dessert menus, so much time had passed that we, too, passed.   The owners of the Dal Rae lost $30 or so in potential dessert orders because we were tired of sitting around.Food?  Yesterday the bleu cheese dressing, which came on the side as requested  - a small miracle - looked curdled and separated, as though it had been sitting out of a refrigerator for way too long.  The other dishes were well-prepared, as they have been in the past, and we'll hope the kitchen doesn't go the way of the wait staff and fall off a cliff.Stepping into this restaurant, where it's alway 1963 and dark and wood-paneled, is a trip back in the time machine.  Unfortunately, if you're on the clock and your employer frowns on 2 to 3 hours lunches, there's no time machine that will get you out of the Dal Rae any faster, apparently.",0
2671,6301,Love love the peppercorn steak! One of my favorite restaurants to dine in . From the atmosphere to the customer service I give this place a 5 star.,0
2672,6302,Came here for a client's lunch meeting and I felt like I am being transported to the 1950s in the middle of nowhere land call Whittier! Prices are on the little higher end side but the service was exceptional.Must get crab cakes! So good with the right amount of richness and acidity.I got the steak but it was just ok. I think the fish of the day would have been a better choice.,0
2673,6303,"Food was good (not the best), the waiters would take away food from the table without really asking if you're done with it, but the thing I didn't like the most was the fact that the place is too compact not a lot of room in there.",1
2674,6304,"The pepper steak is delicious, but the Duck is delectable. We tried them both and they were absolutely exquisite!!",0
2675,6305,"The best!! The best steaks! The best salads! The best drinks! The best service! No comparison to any restaurant it's just incredible don't miss out, you will never walk out of this amazing restaurant disappointed, enjoy!!",1
2676,6306,"Old School amazing steak house.  I love the Dal Rae!I can't believe some people give this less than 5 stars.  If you can't recognize this place as a 5 star joint, you have no business leaving reviews.  The steaks are amazing, the sides and appetizers are delicious and the drinks are strong and made old school (but very pricey...)I like to take clients here for work, and they are always impressed with the atmosphere and food.  This place is a Whittier/Pico tradition.",0
2677,6307,"We came in because we were in Whittier on business that kept us later than expected.  I was surprised to see how crowded it was on a weeknight after 8 pm. We decided to split the special, filet and sea bass, and start with a wedge salad.  Wow all was great.  Best sea bass ever.  Cooked to perfection.  Only surprise was the bill.  Splitting the entre, a salad and inexpensive bottle of wine ended up with a $200 bill.",0
2678,6308,"Not worth the hype. Lousy service on a Friday night. Took over an hour to get our meal. Cocktails were disgusting. We had to ask the busboy several times to call our waitress over. Bread was border line stale. We were also seated by where the waiters place their orders and all we could hear is the waiters complaining about their tables, referring to a certain customer as ""stupid girl"". Gave it 2 stars because the baked potato was pretty good.",0
2679,6309,"Such a great place for celebration. The place is old but the service and food was really good. I had the Chilean Seabass, scallops for appetizer and the table side Caesar salad. Everything was really good. Great place for special occasion. They have a nice bar and a room for parties too.",0
2680,6310,"I went here for Dine LA week, my sister recommend this place to me so I decided to check it out. We got there early and got seated early. We sat in the patio area which was pretty nice and quiet. The lighting was nice. This restaurant look like an antique and old school place. The restaurant was very spacey and I see people dancing by the bar. I got the Dine LA deal where it a three course meal. They give free breads, garlic breads and veggies plate. I ordered the mushrooms stuffed with lump crab, dal Rae pepper filet mignon, and Creme brûlée. The mushroom stuffed with Lump crab was delicious. The filet mignon was just delicious and marinated well. Kind of remind me of Vietnamese style marinating in away. The Creme brûlée was delicious. The services was good and they checked on us often to refill our water and see if we need anything else. I recommends this place if you are craving yummy filet mignon and good dessert.",0
2681,6311,"Love this place!!  Glad that I don't have to go to Beverly Hills for good food and service since I livein the San Gabriel Valley.  This restaurant serves Classic dishes that have been known for years!  Favorites chillan Seabass and pepper steak.I love their desserts also.  Top faves:  soufflé, chocolate cake.  They also have live singers performing in a relaxing cozy environment.  Very classic and romantic!!  Xoxo",0
2682,6312,"The place is great for old timers and the food is ok. I had the fillet mignon, it came a little burnt and a bit cold. It's expensive for lunch but the customer service is pretty awesome.",0
2683,6313,"Our Saturday night dinner was for an anniversary.  We were a party of 6.  It was our first visit, though most of us had heard of The Dal Rae.  We had reservations, smart move.  This place is packed and after dining here, I can totally understand why.  They start with a chilled relish tray and wonderful crusted bread.  We ordered cocktails and wine with dinner.  We started with Escargot, Mac-n-Cheese (as an appetizer - delicious), and Tomatoes and Onions. For dinner we ordered: Ribeye bone-in, New York Pepper Steak, Chilean Sea Bass &  Filet mignon combo, the Steak sandwich, and Frog Legs. Side choices included: Mashed potatoes, garlic mashed potatoes, baked potato, french fries and sliced tomatoes.  The garlic mashed potatoes, french fries and sliced tomatoes were excellent. As the only vegetarian, the Mac-n-Cheese was excellent as was the Grilled Asparagus and the Spinach sauteed in garlic. At the table, we also had creamed corn and a Caesar salad. The portions were huge. With dinner, they serve garlic cheese bread, yummy.  My sister, loved the Chilean Sea Bass so much that she took most of her steak home with her.  Our server said the Chilean Sea Bass had been on the menu for 40 years.  They have perfected it!  From where we sat, we could hear the live music from the bar and the entertainment was excellent!  Our only regret is that we didn't save room for dessert.  They did serve my parents a slice of lemon cake with a candle for their anniversary.  We passed the plate around, so we could all have a taste.  It was really good.  Our server, Michelle, provided excellent service and she added to our enjoyable evening.  We talked about making a trip here as a Family Tradition every year to kick-off the holidays.",0
2684,6314,Valet only. Great service. Friendly staff. Fun ambiance. Mediocre food. Inflated prices. I probably would not return or recommend.,1
2685,6315,Good food good atmosphere. Definitely a place  o check out. I ordered the New York steak. It was amazing! Best place to eat in the area. Definitely check them out!,1
2686,6316,"The Best Chilean Sea Bass I have ever tried in my life. I attended a Birthday Celebration and everyone in the table ordered something different and everyone was extremely happy. The pickles that they brink to your table are like no other.  The place is candle light good for a romantic dinner with that someone special. Drinks a good, Food is amazing and the service is excelente. I'll be back.",0
2687,6317,"Excellent meal. I had the steak Au poivre and it was perfectly done. My companions all had the sea bass and wow! Am I getting that the next time. I can't remember ever having a piece of fish that good. It was not a fast meal, took almost three hours but Dal Rae is not a place you go for a fast meal. A wonderful throw back to an earlier time when people would take their time at dinner.",0
2688,6318,"This place is a MUST GO TO!! Old school style and class, rat pack like erra. Relish trays on the table.Awesome food. the sea bass and peppered steak are to DIE FOR.. Beautiful during the holidays, great piano bar and style.. and did I mention the food is to die for.. we come here a few times a year and always for Christmas..Wish there were more places like this still around..",0
2689,6319,"Everything was awesome. The ambience, service and food were exceptional. I'll definitely be back again.",1
2690,6320,"Apparently,  management doesn't care about a bad review.  We have patronized dal are for over 40 years.  We have celebrated birthdays,  graduations, anniversaries here.  Never had we been so ignored and dismissed as we were for our 29th anniversary.   Staff was inattentive,  management did not stop at our table.   Food was lukewarm.",0
2691,6321,"Time honored classic restaurant. Yet to have a bad meal, even if something is not perfect on a visit. They always seems to be a server that makes up for the kitchens short comings and vice versa, a poor server is usually forgotten about with the classic plates.Defiantly a place to send the kids for a fine dining experience at a school dance.Prices are fair and portions are generous for a steak house.",0
2692,6322,"Had not been here for quite some time, but was in the area, so I checked it out.  No regrets!  This place has a  great variety and selection on their menu for all types.  Love the wedge, to the pepper crusted filet, cocktails and bread pudding dessert!  Great service and all fair priced.",0
2693,6323,What can I say best time I have had I a very long time. Came here to celebrate my girls birthday and we we both got steaks and omg they were delicious why Girl was in love at first bite and my prime ribs was massive and delicious will definitely come back for a romantic dinner once more and making reservations was so easy,0
2694,6324,"I've been here at least 4 times and they never fail to disappoint.  Why is this place so popular?  Steaks are so flavorless.  Same with their halibut.  Pasta is meehh..  Yeah, the ambiance sort of throws you back to the old days but that's not enough to disregard the food quality and flavor.  Why do I keep coming back?  This is where the company likes to hold their meetings.  Might as well get a steak sandwich from next door, Jack in the Box.Valet parking for everyone at $3.95.  What else?  Uhmm..  At night, they have someone play the piano and sing near the bar.  That's something worth mentioning.  Otherwise, just go to Ruth Chris' or better yet, go to Lawry's if you're up for a long drive to Beverly Hills.",1
2695,6325,"Went here for the first time Saturday to help a friend celebrate her birthday. We both had heard about Dal Rae for years but had never been. Loved the atmosphere and throwback to a classy dining experience from years ago! Our server was very nice and informative although she would disappear for longer periods of time than we would have liked. We were there late afternoon and it wasn't crowded so not sure what she was doing out of our sight. In any case, the food was WONDERFUL! I loved the look the bar and told my friend we would be coming back to check it out and enjoy some cocktails.",1
2696,6326,My favorite steakhouse by far! Great service! Caesar salad made table side is a must. All the steaks are outstanding. Cherries Jubilee a nice finish.,0
2697,6327,"Peppered steak is so bomb! Would definitely recommend this place. Staff is very friendly and service was quick. Food quality is top notch, I had the peppered steak and my fiancé had the ribeye. Awesome atmosphere overall great experience.",0
2698,6328,Well My husband have been there many times.  Always enjoyed the Cesar salad for two but don't like the anchovies as it makes it taste too fishy. However tonight the manager confronted me about my request for not wanting anchovies.  He informed me that Worcestershire sauce anchovies in it. Well I didnt know that. But I know when they add it directly to the salad I don't like it. Wow. How bout just not adding the anchovies!!! Will never get the Cesar salad again. What the heck!,0
2699,6329,"Since 1951 this place has been serving the upper crust of the foodie crowd. Bring lots of dough because this place is not cheap, but the food is too die for. Don't wear jeans or any type of casual clothes, remember this is not Denny's.",1
2700,6330,Good food.  Sometimes it feels over crowded in dining area.  LastCaesar salad I had there was over garlicky and salty.,0
2701,6331,"This was my fourth visit to Dal Rae and I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. I took my dad here for his 70th Birthday and the sad thing was his meal was the worst. I've always loved the old school decor and table service we receive at Dal Rae. It was a Friday night and we had reservations at 6pm. The older blonde hostess was very rude about seating our party of 8 even though the restaurant was almost completely empty. We were seated towards the back near the kitchen and it was loud and very chaotic. We proceeded to place our order with two servers that were helping us out. They were courteous but not what we expect when we sit down together for a meal at Dal Rae. The table side Caesar salad was great, along with their awesome relish tray, and bread basket. My mom ordered lobster and it was by far one of the worst things I've ever tasted. It was very tough, chewy, and had a membrane on it that made it almost impossible to eat. My sister ordered the prime rib which was to die for! It was super juicy and perfectly cooked. My dad and I ordered NY Strip Steaks and they were the biggest DISAPPOINTMENT! The steaks were almost a strange gray color and we ordered them both medium rare. There were no seasonings, no grill marks, and the steaks were dry. I have ordered this steak before and I was quite happy with it. Our servers were nowhere to be found until we were almost completely finished with our meal. I had almost my entire steak left since it was so flavorless and I ended up feeding it to my dog later that night. The service and quality of food are really lacking in what my family has expected from Dal Rae for the past 40 some years we have visited it.",0
2702,6332,"dal rae may be a little pricey but worth it!! the filet mignon was so delicious!! my boyfriend ordered the lamb chops which were also tastey. we went on a sat night and it was a little crowded but i love the old school ambiance. the bread basket was impressive and the mashed potatoes were absolutely wonderful!! they were so creamy and they melted in my mouth. they have a great little bar with a lounge area that is fun to just hang out, have a few beers, and chit chat with each other. the service was impecable! they make u feel like you're the only ones they are serving. it was a great experience!",0
2703,6333,Had Escargots Bourguignonne for the first time...delicious!!!! The only place I'll have them. Next was Teriyaki Tidbits warm bites that melt away in your mouth and Ahi Sashimi on Toast just perfect (ask for diced jalapeños and homemade soy sauce). Everything was made to perfection (Fillet Mignon and Ribeye Steak) and service was great!!! Now for those delicious sweets had the Chocolate  Souffle warm chocolate goodness and loved the Banana Flambe caramel and almonds wow!! Thank you Ed Maldonado for treating us to a great dinner!!!,1
2704,6334,"Came for an early lunch, we ordered the Tidbit appetizer, Wedge Salad, Peppered Filet Mignon,  and Alaskan King Crab. Everything was fresh and tasteful! I loved the darkness and casual ambience. Will definitely return and try other items on the menu. Thank you Dawn for the great service!",0
2705,6335,"Had a particularly bad Dal Rae night due to poor management decisions and antiquated HVAC.  Evidently the banquet manager thought that putting a cigar club on the patio would be a good idea.  The smell of cigars wafting every time the front door was opened ruined an otherwise nice anniversary dinner.  We go to Dal Rae for special occasions but this was too  Madmen- retro and a reminder why life span was much lower in the 60's. We came home and threw clothes in the washer and showered to get rid of cigar smell. (We aren't talking distant, exotic, tobacco smell--this was dinner served in ashtray )  Ruined a special night and will ask more questions before going back again for a special occasion.  Had we not already started eating our dinner, we would have left before ordering.",0
2706,6336,"Get ready for a woody and dark restaurant, with an old school circular bar which is fully stocked. Arrive and valet park your car, only, on a Wednesday night for $4.50.Be careful walking in, as eyes need to adjust to dark interior, and was sat in the banquet room.The servers were very friendly and attentive, for a demotion dinner, with about 90 people, and made sure my glasses were filled regularly, from water to alcohol.The sea bass ordered was excellent, covered in cheese/onion ,and the tray of veggies { pickles, peppers etc} on ice was a surprise addition to our meal.The restrooms were very clean and well stocked.Overall a good experience and will return to try the full menu for dinner.Did not give a 5 star, because the air conditioning was insufficient for the room and number of people present.",0
2707,6337,"The pepper steak and a loaded potato is all I eat here! Simply, the best! They make a stiff drink too!",1
2708,6338,"Horrible service and terrible atmosphere.  While making the table side Caesar salad, the waiter used his bare thumb to hold the egg yolk in the egg shell after cracking the egg.   I prefer not to have the waiter's dirty thumb and dirt under his thumb nail in my food.   It was disgusting and this restaurant is not recommend.",0
2709,6339,This place sure knows how to make perfect steak and lamb! My mom's boyfriend took us here for Thanksgiving dinner. I highly recommend the rack of lambs and peppered steak. They can also surprisingly make pretty good fish! Not overcooked like most places. I think it is officially my favorite steak house in LA :),0
2710,6340,"Mum took me and my brother here in August for a birthday dinner. 5 stars for food and we lucked out on our server - she was very attentive/nice; however, my brother and I noticed that since we were not in more formal clothing, the manager had greeted every table (very personal service), but purposefully walked right past us. It was probably mainly because we were not dressed up and we were the minority in the whole place. Took one star off for the pretentious attitude from the manager because service is service, and should be treated everyone equally, especially when paying such a high price for food.I got the prime rib (med.rare), which was amazing, as it should be. My brother ordered the new york cut, which was too chewy for me, but he managed to inhale the entire thing! (we made a bet... he totally won). Mum got the catch of the day, scallops in lemon-butter - very savory, and about 5 pieces for maybe $30-40. Overall, good experience, but hope not to encounter the snotty, pretentious attitude next time.",0
2711,6341,"This place is interesting...I came here for a REDfin home buying event.  So I did not get to experience their main dishes.  However my experience here was enhanced by the decor, ambience, and service.  We were seated in a private room for the event.  Small dishes were provided.  (bread, coconut shrimp, guacamole, tortilla chips, cheese) nothing amazing.  The service was great.I have always passed by this restaurant and thought nothing of it.  It doesn't look too fancy on the outside but its a complete different story on the inside.  When you get inside it has a mysterious and upscale feel to it.  It is dim in there.  There is a live band.Valet your car in the front.I will definitely be back to try their main dishes.  This is somewhere you would come with close friends, family, or maybe a business client.",1
2712,6342,The food here is amazing! Always good service and I really like the old school style to this restaurant.,1
2713,6343,"Had the pleasure of dining at the Dal Rae as a good friend invited me to take a drive to experience an old favorite dinner house. I really had no idea what to expect. All I can say is WOW, the drive was so well with it. Nicely greeted at the front door, super friendly bartender poured a perfect martini. Waitress was right on mark. Although they were extremely packed our server timed her visits on cue. I had the house favorite surf and turf, which is a filet, with fresh sea bass baked potato. The sea bass tasted better than any lobster I've ever had, I even made sure to eat all my leftovers the next day it was so delicious. I had such a great overall experience it's been on my mind to make the drive again soon!!",0
2714,6344,"This restaurant is outstanding in every respect. My parents starting coming here in the 60s, that's how i know about it. I took my 96 year old mom and my girlfriend there tonight. Nothing has changed in all these years. We had the Ceasar salad, i had the filet peppercorn, GF had the sea bass, mom had filet tips in bernaise sauce. It was epic. Next time i try the abalone, also i want to try their happy hour. I would be suspicious of anyone who disses this place. The world is full of haters and those with no taste buds, or no appreciation of a fine continental restaurant and its cuisine.",1
2715,6345,Outstanding dinner and service.  I had the filet mignon pepper steak. And my husband had the New York pepper steak. Both were very tender and delicious. We also had asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes(heavenly). We shared the shrimp cocktail appetizer. We love their garlic bread basket and relish tray.  They surprised us with a piece of chocolate cake - we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.We have eaten here several times and it's always great!,0
2716,6346,"I decided to have a double date at DineLA because they had a DineLA option and because it has 4 stars on Yelp. Based on the reviews and other's word of mouth, we heard they had the best steak in town. Maybe I'm just too picky of an eater but I wasn't impressed.We all shared the Hearts of Romaine and Grilled Artichoke. I expected more out of the Hearts of Romaine salad to be more than just a wedge of Romaine Lettuce with a dash of Caesar Dressing. It was too plain. The Grilled Artichoke was just ok. It came with 2 sauces. I got to try the Dae Rae 14oz Filet Mignon at Medium Rare, which was actually more rare than I liked. I will say though, that the peppered crust was really good. That...I was impressed with. As for dessert, we got the New York Cheesecake with Raspberry Syrup. It was a good cheesecake but not the best. The crust was rock solid and hard to eat.Overall, I think for the price, I'll go somewhere else for steak like Clearman's Steak n' Stein. The ambiance was romantic and the lighting was dim. It is definitely a place for the older crowd. My friends and I were the youngest ones there.",0
2717,6347,"I'm writing a review for three visits.  Let's forget about the fact that I'm (at a minimum) at least 30 years younger than the avg. patron or their servers...or the decor...this place is GREAT!Their pepper steak is insane.  I ordered a lobster tail on the side of one steak and it was bombski!  Cheese bread is insane.  Honestly, everything here is great.I feel like I was dropped into some circa 1978 time warp (complete with crudite appetizer), but I keep coming back.Keep in mind that even though the location is meh, this place is EXPENSIVE!",0
2718,6348,"1st visit here and I am born & bred in Whittier. I heard millions of great things from all my acquaintances & contacts coming in, them being a lot too! My wife(she's been here a few times)decided to bring me here for my 20yr wedding anniversary. She thought I would enjoy it, well let me begin with my introduction to Dal Rae 6pm reservation n 9/11 Wed(not a busy scene) Upon arrival we were immediately escorted to our table. Well afterarriving to it, we decided we did not like the location, I personally approached the hostess asking nicely if we could be relocated to another booth. Well the look alone of disinclined told it all, she replied ""well sit where you want!"" I'd expect this type reply from OUTBACK! SORRY Dal Rae you might need a upgrade here. However luckily for her the rest of the staff totally made up for another employees impoliteness. I was a happy ending to my 20yr wedding anniversary a event I could never repeat in this life time!!!",1
2719,6349,"I have been coming to the Delray for many years. However, I've noticed that the service has not been as good lately. This past New year's Eve my husband, myself and two other couples had dinner there. Three of us, including myself, ordered steak. All three steaks were served opposite of what we asked for. Our server appear to be overwhelmed she took forever to take our drink order so we ordered our own drinks at the bar. They have bartenders (not Berry, he's the best) that look confused when you're ordering what you would like to drink. Our waitress appear to be overwhelmed. One would think that it would be easier to provide good service when you are offering a fixed menu. a smaller man you means less to deal with but apparently this was not the case for us. I called to express my concerns and was told that I could not receive a credit. I told her it was not a credit that I was concerned about, it was the horrible service. That as a customer who likes good service at a time dinning restaurant she might want to share this info with the staff to retain old and new customers. I got an invite to attend their Valentine's Day dinner but I declined. Fixed menus have never been the greatest experience and holidays are never an excuse for poor service.",0
2720,6350,5 Stars to Dal Rae for providing excellent customer service during our wedding reception!!! From the planning to the duration of the evening--smooth and seamless. All of our guests were extremely satisfied with the service and dinner. Highly recommended for small intimate wedding receptions.,0
2721,6351,"My favorite part of all this is that the joint has been around since the 1950's. So, even if it's been remolded a bit, there is still a cool swank to the place.I had the French Onion soup ""B"", a Cesar Salad made fresh at the table I give a "" B"", a tasty Prime Rib Eye on the bone topped with crisp fried onions and green beans on the side and a baked potato ""B-"" over all last time and I had this time I their famous pepper steak with was a Prime cut and very tender (A).  The Bread Pudding I had last time and I gave it a""B-"".Unfortunately they have one of the cheap brands of restaurant coffee ""Apffels"".  Like Farmers Brothers brand, it has the shittest taste when it comes to coffee.  With 3 drinks it was about $70-80 for me. I think the prices were a bit high for the area of town and the shitty taste in coffee.Over all it was a very good dinner with friends. I say go and check it out.",0
2722,6352,"Let me be the millionth person that recommends the pepper steak. Quite delicious. Certainly worth the effort alone. Been here 6 times now, have not strayed from the pepper steak yet!",0
2723,6353,The Dal Rae restaurant was a very pleasant experience. The waitress and the staff are very attentive and informative. The clientele appeared to be older individuals and professionals. The atmosphere felt very relaxing but definitely didn't feel like this is a place to come in with shorts and tennis shoes. At the very least dress casual business attire. I ordered the New York Strip Pepper Steak per the waitress' recommendation. I'm glad I took her recommendation because the steak was good. The mash potatoes taste good as well. This location only offers valet parking and if I recall correctly it's only $4.50.,0
2724,6354,Came here for mom's dinner celebration.  I loved the live music and delicious food.   I understand why families invest in this gem of a restaurant.  Not ideal for date night but a great place to really enjoy a meal.,1
2725,6355,"I've been here for business dinners a few times and I always thougt the food and service was great until I decided to come for dinner one night with my brother. I didn't realize that I only had great service the other times because I was with ""business people"". Our waitress never came around and when she did, she would help everyone around us but not us. It wasn't until the manager came by were we able to put in our order that we've been waiting quite a while for. And when we got our food, everything was just so salty and the outside of our ""famous Dal Rae Pepper steak"" was super burnt. I'm really disappointed by my overall experience this time around.",0
2726,6356,hidden gem of elegance.whe. you walk inside your transported to a different era of fine dining. great place for business lunches or dates. the prime rib is a great choice.,1

Try their pepper steak and fillet mignon stroganoff!And don't  forget to order cherries jubilee for dessert. They flambe cherries by your table and your girl friend loves it :)",0
2728,6358,It was alright.  Ordered a steak and wasn't impressed at all.  I would Definitely try maybe there fish or keep It simple the the noodle dish my bf got and that was amazing but not what i really expected from an expensive steak house.,1

2730,6360,"Voila. I found it. Trying to remember and hoping it still existed and still exemplified the quality I remembered. Yes to all of these.Traditionally the highest quality cuisine combined with personalized service is hard to find especially with tableside preparations of Caesar salad and Steak Diane flambé along with special desserts. Since Valhalla of Sausalito disappeared along with Chateau de Loup of Maui and the Arches of Newport Beach it has been almost impossible to find the quality presentations and tableside preparations of some of our favorite dishes. Kent was amazing as he prepared tableside the best Caesar salad and steak Diane my wife and I have had in a long time. He kept us smiling as he combined a description of the ingredients with some good natured hummer that kept us smiling. Our server Erin went the extra mile to please us and make my wife happy.Thank you for your longevity since it was over 15 years since I was last here with my father. This is the number one restaurant for ambiance, food quality, and friendliness that I can remember.Would give 6 stars if I could.",0

2732,6362,"I have come here at times in the past and had the best food and the best drinks.  But I feel the review of the most recent visit is the best to list. Our waitress' name was Kitty and she was HORRIBLE! My order (soup, entree & dessert) were all screwed up. She had 0 personality and was very snippy. 1 Stars for this visit.In the past, their service has always been good and the food was always great. Let's hope this visit was a one-time thing! 5 Stars for all the other times I've been here.Also, their booze has never changed- always fantastic. Average= 3 stars.  My previous review from that day (when everything was terrible) is below:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~""A place this fucking expensive shouldn't have screw ups like the ones I've had there in the past. French Onion Soup with hardly any onions & a hard chewy cheese layer on top that resembled mortar paste. Hopefully Kitty doesn't work there anymore because she was not at all personable or friendly to us. She made it seem like she couldn't wait to leave that place.They even screwed up a drink order- twice in 5 minutes (same day as the soup brick paste soup).Save your precious dollars & go somewhere else for a fancy night out.""",0

Got a reservation last minute for a birthday which was great, and we got a great slice of birthday cake. Mostly middle aged businessmen. Great for special occasions though. Only fault was that the restaurant is too dark and our lobster was over cooked, it was tough and rubbery. The flavor was great but over cooked lobster is never good. I would still give this restaurant another chance nevertheless.",0

You gotta love these girls when you check in they are not very nice at first but they warm up to you eventually.  My favorite is HEIDI!! she's awesome, if your indecisive like me she can help with some suggestions.  She has the best personality and she's very attentive.  I will make it a point to wait and sit in her section.  For my meal ~I started with the wedge salad, I was there Tuesday and my mouth is still singing yummy yummy. They have the best blue cheese dressing. For my entree I ordered the bone in filet with a baked potato.  My steak was cooked to perfection it slightly pink with a light crust around the edges.  My potato was delicious I only eat the skin and it was skinlicious!.  For dessert we had Death by Chocolate! thats not the name of the dessert but it should be.  Thanks again Heidi for another fabulous dinning experience.  see you soon",1

I answer ""it's in Pico Rivera"" which will be followed by a ""what's a pico rivera?"" ehhhh.....it's an awesome steak house that suffers from being in said pico rivera. Pepper steak was great and prime rib was great.  the time warpy decor is kinda cool too.btw, if you're reading the other reviews keep this in mind, do you really trust the reviews of someone that orders pasta at a steakhouse?

2738,6368,I've heard so many good things about this place and I gotta say it is the garlic smash potatoes are great. The filet mignon cooked exactly how I like it. I brought my 9 month old baby boy all the waitress loved him great atmosphere plus live music/DJ playing some oldies but goodies..,0
2739,6369,"Five star unapologetically . Not my first time nor my last. Impeccable food and service. It's just what you need when you want to go back in time and live and eat classy and elegantly. Get a drink at the bar before your reservation and let your bartender work his magic. The escargot and table side Cesar salad is amazing to start, then move onto the Chilean Seabass. Or pick anything, it's all amazing.",0
2740,6370,"Outstanding dining experience. Right as you enter this eatery, it's old world charm-impressive.The salad plus main dish were exquisite and so was the service-most attentive and efficient.I would very highly recommend this restaurant.",0
2741,6371,This place is way over priced I straight out had  a bad experience Bread they serve was cold and hard and was very cramped people say the bar area is better so I might just give it one more chance,1
2742,6372,"Ok so my review is based on my most recent experience at Del Rae. My business partner and I took our staff for a nice dinner on Saturday night to celebrate a good week at the office. We got seated fast, being that we didn't have a reservation. The staff was all very friendly and our server was amazing. She was on it and would remove plates and silverware as soon as we were done with it.My 3 star review is based on the food. I rarely eat red meat so when I do I really make it worth it. My steak was undercooked and my veggies were overcooked. I was disappointed because I had been looking forward to this steak all day.I really hope it had to with the fact that it was about 9:30pm when we arrived but I had called when we were on our way to see if it was too late to be seated and the lady who answered the phone said we were good because they closed the kitchen at 11pm. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone. However I suggest an earlier arrival.",0
2743,6373,"I would most certainly give Dal Rae a zero star if I could.Let me set the scene for you: Four gentlemen diners, roughly mid to late 20's aiming to be transported back to the golden days of the steakhouse era. Dal Rae talks a big game but drops the ball from the moment you valet your car.Orders:Oysters Rockefeller: VERY subpar. If this was prepared in a salamander oven I'll be shocked. Tasted microwaved.Osso Buco: I am not sure if they confused the idea of ""braising"" with ""quick cooking"" because I'm looking for melt in your mouth tender pieces of veal. Missed the mark by a mile.Diamond Jim Brady Prime Rib:  Ordered rare. Comparing this cut to the similar cuts we've had at Lawrys and The House of Prime Rib in SF we were not impressed. The only highlight was the creamed spinach.Jumbo Fried Shrimp Boat: Not impressed with the flavor of the batter or the value of this dish.Frog Legs in provencal sauce: Perhaps the election of the provencal sauce was not the right pairing, but this dish was lackluster.No dessert after all this.Whopping bill for an awful meal.",1
2744,6374,"New Years Disaster!!!! I made reservations a week before I was NEVER told that the reservations were for 5,7 and 9pm seatings.  I arrived at Del Rae, my friends were running a little late.  I was standing near the Hostess/Manager and she was telling the waitresses the minute you serve dessert to the guests ""give them the check ten minutes later"" supposedly they were expecting 300 guests that night.  I then asked that person if we are on a time limit since I did want to hear Ronnie the musician, she said yes your have until 7pm, now I'm feeling rushed and nervous that I may have to hurry up and leave.  I asked what happened to the chairs at the bar they were gone...no more chairs, she said they removed all of them intentionally. She did tell me that if you want to hear Ronnie to sit at the Piano and I could stay there and would not have to worry about the time.  I was given the menu by our waitress, she's new I have never seen her before.  The dinners that night were all 100.00 you had to order from that menu even if you didn't want dessert it was that or nothing. The waitress brings the food and now tells me I'm on a time limit and they have reservations for the Piano at 7pm and I haven't even started eating.  Rude!!!!!! I'm literally being called a liar and that I was told I was on a time limit...after fifteen minutes of trying to explain everything to this waitress and getting frustrated I really don't feel like eating my dinner. Ultimately we ended up leaving early after our group spent over $600.00 I wasted my time and money... Del Rae is not the same DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!  Btw the majority of the tables were all empty all night. This place is going down hill!!!",1
2745,6375,"Left it up to yelp to try this place. Thank you yelpers. Made my bday night very special!!We came here last Monday night for my birthday dinner, I have to say excellent food, awesome service too. They give you so much bread, and then more garlic bread on top of that. I had a Mahi Mahi dinner with garlic butter  and veggies, it just literally melted off the fork!! so yummmm. That is how fish is suppose to be cooked! He had a huge and I mean huge Prime Rib Diamond cut, I don't even know how many oz that was but it was nuts in my eyes. But that's how my guy rolls. It was cooked perfectly for a 3 inch thick cut of meat. He must of liked it bc he finished all but maybe 4 bites of it. Excellent  place for a special occasion.Prices are high, but you get alot of food and quality as well. They have valet parking and I guess its kind of mandatory bc really, Pico Rivera isn't the best of neighborhoods. Strange how they have this fine establishment in this area, but I will recommend to anyone for special occasions. Been there since the 50's too. Will post pics soon.",0
2746,6376,Amazing food and the abalone is to die for! Another must try is the tableside Caesar salad! The decor and atmosphere is the best during the Christmas holiday. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!,0
2747,6377,"My husband brought me here for Mother's Day. There setting is amazing! Service they provide is also great. We made reservations and they are they don't make you wait at all. Valet is also provided of course you have for that... I had a cadlilic drink it was good, you need to try it.",1
2748,6378,Great job keeping up the old school charm! Steaks were cooked perfectly and wonderfully tender and tasty! Will be back for another meal!,0
2749,6379,Amazing Steaks! Great atmosphere and good martinis. However wait time is long so I recommend early reservations we had our reservation for 8pm we were seated at 830 which was fine since we were able to sit at the bar and have a few cocktails however after being seated not sure if they were short staff but ordering also took some time as our waiter didn't check in. We had to flag him down to order. Once we placed our order food didn't come out until close to 10pm and well it's pretty heavy food for that time at night. Side note If you have late reservation take some tums ;) I would highly recommend making early reservations. Taste of food was amazing. Filet mignon with peppers was cooked perfect! Literally melted in your mouth! The chocolate soufflé another mouth watering item.,0
2750,6380,"Must try: CRAB CAKES, Pepper Steak (either) and Garlic Bread.It was my first time at Dal Rae's last week, and I was pleasantly surprised. My boyfriend and I didn't have reservations for a Sunday night, but we got there early for dinner (before 6pm) and they were able to seat us in the lounge area. It got a lot busier around 6:30pm-7pm. The service was decent considering they were really busy and we were in the lounge area instead of the main dining room area. This place is definitely a nice place to go for a date or to celebrate something. :)I HAVE TO SAY that the crab cakes are amazing. I normally don't like crab cakes because most restaurants put other stuff in crab cakes besides crab.... BUT this place, it is literally ALL crab and it just melts in your mouth. It is a MUST try for sure.After you order your meal, they give you garlic bread, which is delicious!! You almost don't need your entree after you finish the bread... almost.....This place looks like they definitely know their food, so if you order any of the steaks, I'm sure it'll be quite tasty. Enjoy! :)",0
2751,6381,"This was a fantastic night. Great sitting in a booth on Sunday night. Waitress Jackie outstanding. She went above & beyond. The gentleman that made our salad was great very informative. Food was beyond great, incredible. We will be back very soon.Thank you so very much",0
2752,6382,"Let me start by saying that I love steak. I mean I really love steak. I've been to over 50 steakhouses (mostly in NY and California...with a sprinkle in other places like Vegas).I was soo looking forward to Dal Rae because we had heard nothing but good things about it and the yelp reviews seemed overwhelmingly positive.My wife and I went for New Year's Eve right before a show. I loved the look of this place. It has that ""old classic steakhouse"" vibe down pat.The food:Being New Year's Eve, everyone had to go with the pre-fix menu of $100 per person. That included an appetizer, main course and dessert. Wished we had known about the mandatory pre-fix menu ahead of time but that's our fault, not the restaurant's. And besides, the things we wanted to order were available on the pre-fix.I got the Caesar salad (which was  HUGE portion) and really liked it. This, sadly, was the highlight of my meal. An appetizer salad should NEVER be the highlight at a steakhouse.My wife got clam chowder which was served in a small cup and which she said tasted bleh. Wasn't awful but definitely wasn't something she'd remember 10 minutes after eating it.The bread they brought out was cold and hard though the butter they provided was good.I got the famed pepper filet. You would think with the amount of pepper, onion, etc. that there would be SOME flavor. That filet was one of the blandest steaks i've ever had in my life. I have no idea why this steak gets amazing and rave reviews. It just wasn't flavorful at all. I've cooked steaks from Stater Bros that have blown this one clear out of the water.My wife got the regular filet because she didnt want the pepper. Hers was surprisingly more flavorful than mine but STILL SUPER BLAND. It was such a complete and utter letdown that I regretted my decision and thought ""maybe i should have gone with a prime rib or NY steak"". That was until I saw the couple next to us get those 2 entrees. The guy took 2 bites of his prime rib and said there was so much fat he couldn't even cut around it. The girl looked like she was training for the Sochi Olympics as she tried to cut her NY steak.To be fair, the steak pieces were really large. But who cares if you dont even enjoy eating them? That just means there's more food to dislike.The deserts were cheececake and I don't even remember the other one. I'll be saving my money and heading elsewhere. This place really let me down",1
2753,6383,Old School business restaurant. Everyone in the place was doing some type of business dealing super cool.. I got the prime rib dip sandwich and it was amazing.... This is a place I would of never known about..,0
2754,6384,"We have heard about the Dal Rae for years, we finally went.  We did not have reservation, so we were thankful that on a busy night we were seated rather quickly. We were seated at a booth that had a wooden divider, so actually we shared the booth with another couple on the other side of the divider. It was a bit awkward as the other couple was on their phones, I know right! And the phones casts the glow that was always distracting in the corner of my eye. That would be my big complaint, a very expensive restaurant and they have all the tables as close as possible. It was unreal how little room the servers have to squeeze by. Therefore it makes the ambiance very shabby to say the least. That many people crammed in a small space the noise is loud. The food was  nice, but overpriced for what they served. I think Steak and Stein is a better place for the money.",1
2755,6385,"Best steak I have ever had (NY Pepper).Best Baked Potato I have ever had.Coolest decor ever.Great Piano Bar.Super cool staff, nice GM.If only it were across the street.",1
2756,6386,"I have been going to the Dal Rae for over 50 years (yes I'm old).  It is the last of the ""old school"" restaurants.  Consistently good service and food.  My ""go to"" place for great everything.",0
2757,6387,Came for lunch. It was very good.  But it is always good. I have been coming here for over 44 years. It's one of the best restaurants in Pico  Rivera,1
2758,6388,"Five stars, with the only drawback being their Lobster Thermidor, which was fairly disappointing as far as Lobster Thermidor goes--while the presentation was magnificent, the preparation gave the impression that the chef was ignorant as to the traditional way that this dish ought to be prepared, and if his objective was to seem innovative, it came off as illiterate; for instance, it was rather thin, lacking butter, and it smacked of white wine.  For a truly authentic Lobster Thermidor, I highly encourage the chef to try Musso & Frank's version--much more grand, much more traditional, and much better tasting.",0
2759,6389,"Great food, had the lobster real tender moist. Atmosphere was nice, service is outstanding entertainment was great. Definitely recommend nice date night.",1
2760,6390,"Have been here a few times and have tried different dishes everything has been very good.  I like coming during the week for a late lunch, there is not too many people and you are able to enjoy dinner and have a conversation with your party",1
2761,6391,Great food and great service always.  They didn't put garlic in the mashed potatoes.  Yeah!    Love this place,0
2762,6392,"This place is top notch, classy, old School classy where they spare no expense to impress you where the waiters know the menu well, wine choices are good; not too much, not too little. Every dish they have served me illustrates quality!",0
2763,6393,"My wife and I had our wedding reception here and all I can say is that this place is fantastic. All of our guests simply loved the place, they loved the food and especially loved the atmosphere. Thank you to the staff for making this very special day a hit. Del Rae is definitely the place to have an excellent meal and an inviting atmosphere.",0
2764,6394,"One of my favorites spots close to home. Been eating dinner, having cocktails and hosting work events for years. Prefer the bar side over the restaurant side by that's just my preference.

2765,6395,"This restaurant is cool! if you want to travel back into time and experience fine dining of the era, come here. My husband and I love vintage restaurants and especially so since our style often times  fits the theme of the restaurant.We celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary there, and we got first class treatment! We even got a complementary slice of cake to celebrate our union.",1
2766,6396,"My wife and I ate there last night. We arrived at 6:30 and were seated immediately. Our server was very attentive and so were her assistants. We each had a wedge salad. My wife had shrimp scampi and I had a pepper steak. For dessert we had creme brulee. Everything was excellent...food, service, etc.",0
2767,6397,"Loved this place! The service, the wine, the food, the dessert, was amazing. I'd driven past this place many times growing up, not imagining the little gem that lied within. I'd choose this place a thousand times over Fleming's, Ruth's Chris, and Morton's. The creme brulee with berries is so yummy!!!!",1
2768,6398,"This was an amazing experience! The food was delicious! The Chicken Monterey was so tasty! Wedge salad was huge, two shared, and we each had plenty! My friend had the seabass, a specialty of the restaurant and she was totally impressed! The service was the best ever!",0

2771,6401,Went for a girls night out!!! Great food had the surf and turf yummy!!! Cesar salad delicious drinks overpriced not that great,1
2772,6402,Totally over 5 stars. My mouth is still watering just thinking of their prime rib. It was delicious and prefect cut. It's hard to find a place that serves great tasting prime rib. We will definitely come back to this place.,0
2773,6403,"This place is usually amazing, but they fell short this time. Took my wife and a friend here for their birthdays and it took soooo long to get our food. The server kept coming by and apologizing and said it was coming soon, but it wasn't. When our food finally did arrive, all of our steaks were overcooked. My wife's sea bass was good though. They made us new steaks and said they would take something off the bill, but the only thing they took off was a glass of wine we didn't even order to begin with, they just brought it out because of the wait. I wasn't going to argue, it wasn't worth it. By the time we were done, we had been sitting for 3 hours and missed the last showing of the movie we were going to see. So disappointing.",0
2774,6404,"Amazing food and service always. Favorite dishes here: we always start with a Ahi tuna on toast. Just trust me it's delicious ask for avocado on it. The Chilean sea bass (a la Ben) is a fresh fish with a light mild flavour comes with a light cream sauce and grilled onions. The Caesar salad is also great and is made at the table fresh, perfect for sharing. Finish off with their creme brûlée.",0
2775,6405,My fiancé & my best friend had dinner there tonight & it was delicious. Best pepper steak I've ever had! It was our first time there & we'll definitely be back! The service was great & our waitress was awesome!! Perfect atmosphere! Loved it!,0
2776,6406,"The atmosphere was great, the staff was fantastic and the food was even better!  Haven't been@Dal Rae for maybe 15 years.  It is so darn cool!   I should probably try something other than steak but it is do darn good!",1
2777,6407,"Awesome! Classic old school high class high quality fancy steakhouse.  I've only been 3 times but each time has been fantastic. I love the Ceasar Salad getting tossed at the table. The abalone is great. It will cost you, but that's the nature of that hard to find treat. Each time the seafood I ordered has been top notch. If it was closer I'd be there more often.The last time I was there was an impulse at lunch as I drove the 605. I forgot they had a basic dress code. I was in shorts & flip flops. I slipped past the lady at the door and ate at the bar with no problem.  One of my favorite So Cal restaurants. Can't wait to get back!",0
2778,6408,"Anniversary Dinner Celebration. Great service all night. The prime rib was excellent and very tender. The pepper steak could have been a little more tender but the seasoning was very tasty. Dinners come with salad, bread and veggies.",0

2781,6411,Took daughter here for her birthday. She loved it. Always a pleasure and running into a old friend topped off the evening.,1
2782,6412,Simply amazing! I love this place. The prime rib and filet mignon are to die for however their mashed potatoes could use work. Other than that the food is excellent. The ambiance is killer. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a location for a perfect date.,0
2783,6413,Went to dinner with 8 guest last night for my wife's Birthday. The service food and drinks were amazing the pepper steak was great a long with the Caesar salad. I look forward to dining at Dal Rea again soon,0
2784,6414,This place is awesome! Love a great steak and the ambiance is wonderful! Great date spot!,1
2785,6415,"This is my second time having dinner here. This place is fascinating. The clientele ranges in age which I think speaks well to this establishment.As I have mentioned in my reviews I have Celiac Disease which means I cannot eat any gluten. This restaurant was so nice and very careful. My waitress was just adorable. I ordered a particular salad and she repeated several times ""No croutons for you"".I had the Seabass and it melted in my mouth. Absolutely perfect.",1
2786,6416,"I've passed by this restaurant many times over the years and had no idea what it was until pretty recently. Pico Rivera is pretty much a blue collar, Mexican American neighborhood with moderately high crime and has been for quite some time. I only mention this because if this restaurant was in a better or Jewish neighborhood, the food prices would probably be between 15%-30% higher. So it's safe to say this place is a hidden gem in plain sight.Dress code is business casual, but they're not super strict about it. I came in with a slim fit Zoo York plaid cholo style shirt, Vans' khakis and some Nikes, (like a cholo going to his kids' baptism) no problemo. Ambiance is nice, reminds me of old school dining. Dim, wooden interior, waiters wearing suits and ties, the whole nine yards. It looked like we were in the 50's or so. There is a bar but I did not go. Dinner was fantastic. We had this appetizer which consisted of tuna on cheese, spinach, and bread, which was a hint of the quality that was in store for later. I had a New York steak ""peppercorn"" style, which I hear is their signature, award winning style. My mother and girlfriend had the seabass which they loved, and my father had some pasta with giant shrimps. He didn't care too much for the pasta but the shrimp was fantastic. The service was fantastic and the recommendations on point. Since it was my birthday they gave me a free piece of chocolate cake.People watching is interesting here. The parking lot is full of expensive cars (I even saw a Tesla) and a couple of beaters, so you get people from all walks of life in here. I saw what I believe to be a lot of successful businessman taking their hoodrat girlfriends out to dinner. I mean these were guys who were dressed nicely taking out these hynas in hoochie style dresses with tats all over the place. I'm sure all those guys got laid that night.I'm being a bit generous giving this place 5 stars overall. Based off my meal, I would give it 4.25 stars if possible. The service I would give 6 stars if I could. I just can't see them asking to justify a valet fee ($4.50) when there is plenty of parking right there. I could understand if this was a neighborhood in West LA or Downtown with a lousy parking situation. They have a large parking lot and valet should be optional! I'm also tacking on the fact they don't have any IPAs on draft, only Goose Island in a bottle.  You should still come though.Now I know why friends come as far as Long Beach, Pasadena, and Arcadia come out this way to eat here.",0
2787,6417,"Over the years I have dined at the Dal Rae numerous times and can truly say it is one of the finest dining spots anywhere.  Last night we dined at there for their for the 55th anniversary celebration that was going on all week.  They were offering the standard cut prime rib or salmon for $24.95.  Nice discount from the menu price.  But no one goes there for just the dinner alone.  There are drinks, appetizers, special salads and can't pass on the great desserts.  We took some friends with us who had never been to the Dal Rae and they were very impressed.The décor is dated but that is what makes it so special.  You can't help but feel the Rat Pack is there with you.  Service is second to none.  Yes there are some wait times but when you come there why do you have to be in a hurry?  You are having a fantastic dining experience at one of the most iconic supper clubs around.  If you want fast food don't come here.  Learn to relax and enjoy yourself.  Learn to have a conversation with your spouse or friend(s).I have to laugh at some of the low ratings posted.  It is very obvious they have never experienced high end dining.  Without a doubt the prices at the Dal Rae are up there but worth it.  If their prices bother you have you been to Ruth's Chris or Morton's?  Dal Rae has more variety then either of those.When seated they bring you a basket of breads and a fresh relish tray.  If you start your meal with one of the special salads they also bring you some cheese garlic bread that is wonderful.We all ordered the prime rib.  Our guests opted for end cuts while my wife and I chose med-rare cuts.  We opted for the Caesar salad while our guests ordered the wilted spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  Both were made at the table and were excellent.  The prime rib came with a side of asparagus that was cooked perfectly and you had your choice of potato.  While I chose a baked potato with the works (butter, sour cream & chives) the rest ordered the garlic mashed.  All were perfect with our meal.  The horse radish sauce that comes with the prime rib has just enough kick to get your sinus' draining.  Loved it.  You could tell the prime rib was prime grade.  It was super flavorful and tender.  While they gave you a steak knife for cutting it wasn't really needed.  You could cut the meat with your butter knife.  The meal was simply fantastic.For dessert we ordered the chocolate soufflé.  You need to let your server know ahead of time if you want the soufflé.  Since we were aware of this our soufflé's came out just a short time after we finished our dinner.  Talk about a great way to finish up a most excellent meal.  That is one of my absolute favorite items at the Dal Rae.I am going to give them a 5 star rating.  Love the atmosphere, service was spot on, food was excellent and overall experience was fantastic.  Yes it is pricey but ask yourself how does a restaurant stay in business for 55 years if they are not doing something right.  We have enjoyed a number of their entrée's and can truly say they were excellent.  Yes we highly recommend the Dal Rae for a dining experience second to none.",0
2788,6418,"The service here was amazing! Came here for valentine's day. It was packed but the servers were still very attentive and friendly.For appetizer we ordered:*Rockefeller oysters - which I loved.*Artichoke - I wasn't a fan of.For the main dishes, I ordered the lobster tail & my fiancé ordered the filet mignon pepper steak. It wasn't anything special but it wasn't bad at all.Overall, we enjoyed our dinner.",0
2789,6419,"Back in 1963, my dad took my mom here on their first date.  The man had style!  And, to this day, it's still a great place to go for a fancy date or an anniversary or your birthday.  Trust me, gents.....you take your special lady here for dinner and drinks and she will adore ya!  My mom and I returned here for lunch after my father passed and my mom said that it hasn't changed much.  And the food is just terrific!  They have the classics and some modern goodies!  I love their ahi sashimi on toast!  And you can never go wrong with the classic escargot.  Their prime rib is just outstanding, as is their filet mignon.  And, of course, dinner is never complete without creme brulee or strawberries loaded with with Grand Marnier!  Or, if you REALLY want to impress her, get cherries jubilee!  Also, never forget their bar!  Their martinis are just amazing, When you come to this kind of place, go old school.  Think ""Mad Men"".....a martini, a Manhattan or a gimlet.  Leave your hipster at home.  You can even dress the part.  Wear a snazzy suit, have your lady break out her little black dress.  Make it a night to remember!  So that, twenty years from now, you can tell the same story my mom still tells about how my dad took her on their first date to a really snazzy restaurant.",1
2790,6420,"Wow! Took my parents here for a special meal and am so glad I did. They grew up in Whittier in the 1960's and remember the Dal Rae as the swankiest place in town, and it still is. Service was gracious and smooth, they've kept the place looking fabulously mid century but with 21st century TLC, and most importantly the food was absolutely wonderful from start to finish!We had cocktails in the bar that were prepared perfectly, then moved on to the dining room for escargot appetizer that was garlicky and delicious. Salad was the special Caesar Salad prepared freshly tableside with real garlic, real egg, real everything, and was honestly the best Caesar Salad I've ever had! Prime rib was huge and delicious, gorgeously peppered and prepared. Then bananas flambe, again prepared and flamed tableside.There are not many places like this left, but the Dal Rae does it beautifully and with very high quality food. My compliments to the chef and the kitchen, to the dining room staff, and to the management. Plus was when I got up to depart and somehow they knew which car was mine and the valet guys were driving it up just as I walked out the big front door. Classy ending to a very classy place!",0
2791,6421,"My husband and I were 1st time diners & have fallen in love and have found our ""Go To"" favorite dinner spot.From the moment we pulled into the driveway, we were greeted by valet parking and throughout our entire dining experience; they made us feel like special guests . . . . . however that's the pristine, stellar service they provide to all.The Chilean Sea Bass was the ALL TIME BEST I've ever had, my husband had the perfectly cooked prime rib.  SO happy we chose this place to celebrate our Anniversary; super excited my birthday is in 12 days; guess where we're going to celebrate my 50th!!  Thank you Sylvia for great service & making us feel at home best of luck to you on your new adventure.",0
2792,6422,My husband liked it. I guess I was just looking for something a little more for our anniversary dinner. I've heard good things about this place but it just wasn't my type of steakhouse. I don't think the romaine used for my salad was rinsed. As for my sea bass the lemon butter sauce was good.,1
2793,6423,"Tried to make a reservation to celebrate our anniversary. Called at 11:45am and was asked to hold...5 minutes went by and I hung up because I got another call. Called back at 12:05 and girl who answered the phone immediately answers a questions I had. I then told her I wanted to make a reservation for 7:00pm, she put me on hold to check if that time was available. Was put on hold for 13 MINUTES!!!. I gave up. Guess we won't be having dinner there.",1
2794,6424,"Had a 9 pm reservation. They were busy, but we were attended to pretty quickly. We were not provided drink menus and had to wait a few minutes for those to arrive. The drinks were slow to arrive (almost 10 min). We ordered the Caesar salad, which was prepared table side. It was good. Bread at table was worse than grocery store deli bread and not warm. We waited 30 min after we finished the salad for entrees to come. Really? By this time, the restaurant was mostly empty, so I don't understand what took so long. I ordered the cheeseburger. It was dry and had no flavor. The side of asparagus was overcooked and very stringy. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm. It was average. Very average. In fact, Olive Garden is ten times better. Pretty disappointing for a $125 dinner.",0
2795,6425,"Dal Rae is probably the ""classiest"" place in the area. The crowd and the decor is ""older"" definitely a dark 50's vibe to it, there is a bar to left of the entrance.The menu is pretty vast, good for a business meeting or date a like. The wine selection is reasonable. The food portions are pretty large, you can even share i believe there is an $8 split charge (lame).I ordere the bone in filet cooked ""black and blue"", unfortunately it was overcooked, it was medium rare more medium, i showed the waitress but she never offered to have it redone, needless to say most of it was left on the plate.My friend order salmon and said it was cooked perfectly. For dessert we opted for the bread pudding which was delicious.Parking is valet $3.50 charge.",0
2796,6426,"We have dined all over the world and their Chilean sea bass is to die for. They have great steak lobster and salad,we took our granddaughter and she said five stars.They are very friendly and clean. They have good music toward the end of the night and good atmosphere.",0
2797,6427,"It's like stepping back in time with this high-end restaurant. The food is superb, the staff is friendly and the ambiance is hard to find. I love the table-side salads, the pepper steak and sea bass, and most importantly, the desserts & cocktails. Depending on my mood, I either sit in the lounge for a more lively scene or I dine in the main dining room for a more relaxed intimate experience. Simply divine!",0
2798,6428,"Don't let the old school architecture and ambience fool you....The food is amazing.  We tried both the sea bass and filet... Both were delicious!  I don't believe that it would be a stretch to say the sea bass is the best I've ever had!  The filet was so tender...  If Del Rae isn't on your calendar, you are certainly missing a fine dining experience!Having some Sinatra era tunes playing doesn't hurt either!f",0
2799,6429,"Went to Dal Rae last Friday and it was great! It has an old school steakhouse vibe that it's hard to get in the LA area where everyone wants to be a trendsetter. All the food was great but some items were real standouts.1. Garlic cheese bread - Amazing! I could literally just eat this for dinner.2. Masked potatoes - They were creamy and delicious, just the right texture!3. Prime Rib - This was the real standout! It was probably the best prime rib I've ever had, prepared perfectly, and a very generous cut. Unlike most Prime rib places, there was not a ton of fat on the cut either.My wife had the pepper steak which seems to be their signature and while it was good, it wasn't a standout. The steak would have been better without the topping. The only real letdown was the dessert. We ordered the creme brulee and I expected it to be top notch. It was more the consistency and flavor of custard than it should have been but all in all it was okay.Dal Rae is a great choice for a steak and a great place to avoid Hollywood crowds, I highly recommend it!",0
2800,6430,Ok ok ok where to begin. Ok first make a reservation if you are going on a busy weekend. Second this place is so old school and it's great this place has been around for years. Yes it's in the pricey side but it's worth it trust me. I have been here like 10 times in 2 years and hits the spot from steak to pork chops to fish I have had it all. Honestly you can't go wrong. Caesar salad is a must and baked potato. This is totally a place for you to bring parents or even grandparents who love a classic steak house.,0
2801,6431,"Stunning restaurant. Best atmosphere I could ask for. This location is perfect if you want the best streak, and drinks. Mashed potatoes were creamy and seasoned perfect. Best asparagus I can remember and drinks were delicious. Can't wait to come back and try more of their menu.",0
2802,6432,"Great food, great old world vibe. What more could you want?This is a great place for a business dinners. Ask them to put you on the covered patio for privacy.",1
2803,6433,"This is the perfect place for a special event. There's an old school vibe, retro-like. The food is phenomenal, have been coming here for years! I love the table side prep for their steak Diane, Caesar salad and bananas foster. The seabass is also top notch!They are also decorated beautifully for Christmas! Open for lunch and have great service. Always feel satisfied!",0
2804,6434,All I gotta say is the prime rib was pretty amazing... I also had the pleasure of getting the fresh made cesar salad which was also very tasty. The wait was a bit long for the food but the place was packed so I'm sure its pretty normal. It didn't really bother me though because once the food came you forget about all that.,1
2805,6435,"Came here last Saturday night for the Dine LA special prix fixe dinner and thought everything was outstanding. We all got different appetizers. The baked scallops were very tasty as was the soup of the day (French onion). We had heard great things about the ceasar salad and were disappointed. Maybe expecting too much? All of our group ordered their signature filet mignon pepper steak and all thought if was fantastic. They DO NOT make a smaller portion of lower class of steak just because of the Dine LA special. Great peppercorn, green onion mixture on the steak. One of a kind. The special also came with choice of dessert which were standard creme brulee, NY cheesecake, or their ice cream sundae. We all enjoyed the Dal Rae "" old school"" feel to the place too. In fact the only reason I didnt give 5 stars is the parking situation. I suggest you take advantage  of the valet parking for 5 bucks and spare yourself the trouble",0
2806,6436,"We came here for a belated birthday dinner.  This is one of the more expensive restaurants I've been to, so I was hoping for very good food. The price really doesn't match the quality. There were 8 of us, and we ordered a variety of dishes. I  had the 14 oz peppered filet mignon, which, according to them, has been imitated by many, but only perfected by Dal Rae. Well, when you advertise it like that, it should be very good.  Well, I was extremely disappointed. I was really looking forward to the first bite.  The steak was completely bland. It absolutely lacked any flavor.  For $38, you would think that they'd know how to season it.  I also tried a little of the Diane, which was a bit better. At least the sauce had flavor, so I ended up dipping my steak in that sauce. Well, at least that's classier than asking for A1 steak sauce at a restaurant like this.  My brother ordered a burger, which was big, but he said it was just ok as well. I don't think his fiancee liked her spaghetti much,she only ate a bit of it.  My boyfriend and mom did like their red snapper. I should've gone with that!We didn't order any appetizers, but the free bread that they gave us was delicious!  We had three batches.  They also gave us some garlic cheese breads. Not sure if we ordered it, or if it was free. But regardless, it was excellent.  We had the flambe and a chocolate and a grand marnier soufle.   Now, those are good!  I like the chocolate soufle the most.  If you're in any sort of a hurry at all, then you definitely don't want to come here. Service is sloooow. It was an hour before our food started coming out.  Our waitress(es) because for some reason, we had two, were friendly, but not very knowledgeable.  Birthday boy asked some questions regarding the menu, and she incorrectly answered them.  Yeah, you would think that they'd know better seeing that they work there.Oh, and it's valet parking only, but we were cheap, so we opted for street parking and walked the block there and back.  So...to recap, I don't recommend the filet mignon, unless you like paying a lot for something so bland or if you need to watch your blood pressure.  Stick with their fish and go crazy on the dessert!",0
2807,6437,"Very disappointed on their service I went for my best friend's birthday that was a surprise 12/27/2015 on a Sunday at 7p.m.. I just went 2 weeks before for my company's christmas luncheon was great. I don't know what that day Sunday 2 weeks after for my friends birthday. The service was horrible,  we waited for our food 2 hours. The waiters did not come notified us, we had to keep on flagging down the waiters. Felt like their busser/runner  was more helpful than the waitresses. They put us in the back table last room. We noticed that they were more attentive to other tables than us. They look like they were bothered. If their kitchen is behind at least come and tell us at least that we know what is going on. The waiter was rude towards the end when the bill came. Didn't even come to apologize for the inconvenience for the food at least.This is a fancy nice restaurant would think great service. Before I would tell my friends this is a great restaurant everything is worth it for being upscale restaurant pricy. I have come and the pass for my companies Christmas luncheon always satisfied I don't know what happened this day. I called the next day to speak to the manager the manager didn't call me 4 days later. He just said sorry and I could come in next time as for him he will give us a free bottle of wine or a free appetizer or free dessert",0
2808,6438,"Love the ambiance and the food was great! Massive portions . I ordered the end cut prime rib, it was excellent. Servers very nice!  Will come back",0
2809,6439,"A very strong solid A-OK - 3 stars. Eaten several times and its always predictable. Made reservations early (6:30 on Friday) for an anniversary dinner and advised the staff so. Showed up on time, and we were seated at the WORSE table -between two waitress stands, bus boy stand and the passage way to the bar/restrooms. HORRIBLE.All you see during your meal are a bunch of well-fed waitresses butts in your face slinging giant trays of food out of the kitchen and dirty dishes piling back in.They should seriously consider shutting this table down or comping meals. Period. Danielle our server was great, the food was good and we enjoyed yourselves in spite of the table. If it had not been a special dinner (and therefore neither of us wanted to ruin it), this would have required intervention with a re-seating. The French Onion soup was killer, the shrimp cocktail was delicious, ditto on the pepper steak. Just avoid the crappy table and stay away on Friday and Saturday. Its a great non-chain standby.",0
2810,6440,The Chilean Sea Bass was so good and service was excellent. Cesar salad made fresh is a must if you go there,1
2811,6441,"Liked the meal and the experience generally but the dining space was a bit too crowded. We ordered many table side items but since they sat 8 large people at the 4 top table next to our booth, there was no room. So the table side show was on the side of the dining room and not part of our experience.Generally a fun flash from the past place to dine.",1
2812,6442,"It pains to me have to revise this downward. My family has been coming here since my mom and her sisters, now in their late 50s and early 60s, were small children. During my formative years, Dal Rae was the place to go for a special occasion, because the food, the atmosphere, and the service made you feel special. And while the food is still above reproach, the other aspects of the restaurant have suffered gravely. I waited to post this, as I thoguht perhaps my poor-quality visits were isolated incidents, but alas, I'm sad to say that every visit since my last review has been notably sub-par.The pièce de résistance: the last time my aunt drove to Dal Rae, the hood ornament from her Jaguar was stolen while in the valet lot. And it wasn't simply wrenched free. When we noticed it missing later that night, and opened the hood to inspect the damage, it was clear that the ornament had been unscrewed (a lengthy process, as we discovered while attaching a replacement, with three screws and several pieces) from the inside. To get into the hood, you need the key. And the only people other than my aunt that had the key during that period were the Dal Rae valet staff.Another rather glaring occurence: A family favorite is the grenadine of beef. It's no longer on the menu, but if you call ahead, they'll be able to make it for you. Same with clams Oregonata, which I also highly recommend. On this visit, two of my aunts and one of my cousins got the grenadine. A day and a half later, all three were bed-bound with food poisoning. None of them told the others, assuming it was something they had eaten in the meantime. But then my cousin reheated and ate the leftover grenadine he had taken home, and was re-sickened. When they all compared notes, it was without a doubt the grenadine of beef that sidelined them.Another: a server mixed up my party of two's bill with the party of seven next to us. Not when we were brought the bill, as it was accurate then, but after we had departed and the final charge was made (to include tip and such). Suddenly a hundred-dollar dinner cost over $500. When we called to rectify the situation, the accountant told us that that happens all the time with that particular server, who, it should be said, still works there.Smaller example: on our last visit, my entire party ordered, with their entrees, salads with blue cheese dressing, no croutons (croutons were not originally served with Dal Rae salads, and we rather prefer them that way). When your party orders en masse like this, they prepare the salad tableside and serve each person. On this particular visit, each of us got about a fourth of the normal serving portion (keep in mind, this is based on 25 years of averages for me, 50 for the prior generation). Seriously, like 5 bites of salad. When we asked what was up, we were told it was busy, so we get what we get. Needless to say, this does not befit a restaurant of Dal Rae's standing.Countless other small detractions add up: often, we have to wait upwards of 15 minutes to receive menus and to order cocktails. Waters are not refilled with anything resembling regularity. One of my aunts ordered a Shirley Temple, and got instead a seltzer with grenadine. When it was pointed out, it took 15 minutes to remake. My cousin was poured water with a fly in it. Order a Tom Collins, get a vodka Collins. And so on.Individually, they're almost unnoticeable detractions (minus the stolen hood ornament and credit card mishap). But when they recur regularly, and no part of the dining process is spared some sort of headache, the experience really suffers. And when you're paying $50-80 a head, and paying $15 for cocktails, you're paying for the service, for the experience. And frankly, I had a better experience the last time I went to the Jack in the Box that's next door to Dal Rae.",0
2813,6443,"Dal Rae is a singular establishment.Dishes that in the modern era have been neglected and forgotten, like lobster thermidor and escargot, are mainstays here.  The pepper steak, although not ""steak au poivre"" in the traditional sense, is without a doubt the best piece of beef I've had in my travels round this globe. Forget Paris, London, Rome, Zurich, New York, DC, Palm Springs, Miami, Dallas; it's all about Pico Rivera. Salads are prepared tableside, and their blue cheese is to die for (and probably to die of; I shudder to consider its fat content).The owners circulate frequently, and never fail to greet you warmly, whether it's your first time or your family's been coming for nearly fifty years (as we have). Also, Dal Rae is of very few restaurants where you can order a Manhattan, and rather than receive a blank look in return, be asked your bourbon preference and ""straight up or rocks?""It used to be that going to Dal Rae was like visiting a nursing home on formalwear night, but about nine years ago they redid the interior to make it more retro-fifties than unchanged-since-the-fifties. Consequently, the average age of the diners is down about twenty years.Dal Rae is definitely worthy of a special trip, and a sublime setting for the most special of events. When you make your reservation, ask if Kitty's working: she's the bestest, most fabulous server in the place!",1
2814,6444,"THIS IS THE BEST RESTAURANT NAMED FOR A HORSE in LA.This is the best and classiest restaurant in a 20 mile radius around Pico Rivera.  It has all the history that a great restaurant should have dating back to 1958.Not many places still serve a relish tray. Don't know what that is?  Go there and find out.It has changed its menu with the times, but still serves meals which take me back to times past.  While the diverse menu could appeal to folks looking for a fine meal for around $20, I usually don't hold back.  I go for the gusto.The service is exquisite.  Tableside service is a thing of the past, but not here.It was a regular lunch spot for me in the 90's when I worked nearby and frequently drank most of my lunch.  It is still a very special place for an impressive lunch.  The parking crew has the tradition of parking the most expensive cars at the front of the lot so you can see them when you enter from the street.The bar.  What can be said of a well stocked bar - finest Scotches, Whiskey and Tequila.  Just try and challenge the bartender.The wait staff is mature and professional.  I like that.Fresh French bread, Oysters Rockefeller,  lobster Thermidor, baked potato, creme brulee and a night cap.  Heaven - yes.They put ice in the urinals - what more can I say?  You need reservations, even for lunch, even during the week - it is just that good.",1
2815,6445,Yummy Yum Yum... Truly one of my favorite restaurants around. They should open a training class for other restaurants on customer service.,1
2816,6446,"You will have to drag me by my hair to come here again.It has taken me this long to finally write a review about this restaurant, what an upsetting experience!A few friends and myself have been coming here for some time during the Holiday Season for dinner. The restaurant has a  19070's ambiance to it, something you would see in the movie Casino. However, during the Holiday Season, it looks like Santa threw up Christmas lights.Reservations were made in advance and yet we still had to wait an hour for a table, yet again. This also happens on non-holidays as well.We finally sat down, enjoyed a great meal, our server was overwhelmed but nonetheless very friendly. It's what came after next that soured our whole dinner experience and why we won't be back.We had paid our bill and was waiting for the credit cards to come back from the server. Meanwhile, the hostess along with another older blond woman who seemed to be trying too hard to hold onto her youth, came looming by like a couple of vultures, giving us dirty looks. I looked up and wondered what was going on. Here comes one of the owners, with a smile and yet a nasty look on his face. He asked us if we needed help figuring out the bill. Before we could even answer,  he also proceeded to advise us that they have people waiting for this table and that we needed to leave. RUDE!!! If he had checked with our server first he would have known that we were waiting  on her to process our credit cards. A mediocre apology came quietly out of his mouth if that was an apology at all.The unbelievable part was that the hostess told the bus boys to start cleaning up the table and we didn't even get our credit cards back yet!!Didn't expect to be treated so poorly at this establishment at all. We work too hard for our money to be treated in such a manner, especially by the owner.Restaurants who overbook and make their guests wait for a long period is just poor business.An effective owner/manager would go to the server first to get status's of the tables before making a poor judgment call by going to the party directly. Somehow, I am not surprised he didn't go to the servers, I don't think this restaurant treats them very well.Our server was awesome and accommodating!!Too bad everything else sucked rotten eggs.",0
2817,6447,"I recently enjoyed having dinner here at this establishment, and I must admit, I never heard of this place before, we were celebrating newlyweds, party of 6. The food was delicious, and per suggestion of our wonderful waiter, we all ordered different dishes and appetizers and sampled each others dishes without being disappointed. Hence, I will most definitely visit again . In fact a party of 8 in March in honor of my daughters birthday~ Thank you for providing flavorful cuisine, a pleasurable and comical experience, as our server was hilarious~",0
2818,6448,"This place is old school straight out of the movie Good Fellas. Met a former work colleague here for some drinks and small bites. We sat in the bar area where a woman was singing and playing the piano. The mixed drinks were good as was the food. There is nothing bad or horrible here but at the same time nothing stood out or was great. My only issue was it seemed like it was only valet parking on a quiet Thursday night for $6 which I didn't think was necessary, perhaps on the weekends.  They should offer self parking as well during the weekday. Not my kind of place but I know my older colleague loves this place since he grew up coming here with his folks.",1
2819,6449,"i thought i reviewed this restaurant??...very disappointed in myself.i cant remember what i had but have pics of it.... i had a cod... or some kind of white fish and it was probably the best i ever had. the food was really good, very good tiramisu...old looking atmosphere but friendly, considerate staff.i'd like to go again so that i can give a less half-assed review.",1
2820,6450,"One word to describe this place: Wow.I would have never suspected a restaurant in Pico Rivera adjacent to Jack In The Box and near Sizzler's and King Taco to blow my socks the way it did. The date was also a bit skeptical of the location of this place, but his qualms disappeared when we stepped into this place. It was like we were transported into another world -- a classy place that is perfect for a romantic night of wining and dining....were we honestly still in the same Pico Rivera that I've known all my life from living in the city next door to it ?When we went last night, the place was decorated with Christmas trees, snowflakes, and tons of Christmas lights that made the place extremely beautiful. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful in terms of recommendations. Because of him, we tried the cream of asparagus soup, which was smooth and tasty.Our entrees consisted of (1) a petite cut of their pepper steak, cooked medium and (2) a regular cut of their prime rib. Both of them were delicious and our waiter told us that our tasty meats were imported all the way from the Midwest. Out of the two, I loved the pepper steak more. We ordered both entrees with the side of garlic mashed potato and that was also delectable. With great service, delicious food, and a spectular ambiance, this place is definitely a must return for me.",0
2821,6451,"New Years Eve is our wedding anniversary...we wanted to go somewhere different than the usual O.C./L.A. flashy spots. One of my clients said that the Dal Rae is her fave place. The hubby loves a good steak and throwback restaurants so I thought this would be a cool place to try. Read all the reviews and our experience was really similar. My one complaint.................there was a holiday menu with limited choices and higher prices, I am cool with that, it's New Years, I was expecting it. But what I wasn't expecting was the very small print at the bottom of the page....""There will be a $20.00 per person cover charge for anyone seated after 6:30 pm"".For what?????? And they added it straight into the bill, like she wanted us to tip on it, too! We sat at 7 pm and were out by 8:15...service was a bit rushed to get more cover charges!That should have been mentioned to us when we made the reservations, tsk tsk!",1
2822,6452,"Don't come to Dal Rae unless you expect to pay a bit more than you should but part of the cost is the entertainment value of being at Dal Rae.This is old school.  You half expect that they somehow were able to get exemption from State to allow smoking in the place to cement that you stepped back in time to a steak and cocktail joint where men wear suits and check their hats and ladies are all in dresses and heels.As for the food--excellent.  Oysters, baked brie, salads, steaks, fish, all done with the experience a place like Dal Rae puts on a plate.Is it pricey? Sure.  Is it worth it for a memorable evening out with your sweetheart and/or with friends? Absolutely.If getting the full experience, cocktails in the bar, appetizers, salads or soup, entrees, wine, dessert, figure on up to $100 per person and don't forget the tip.",0
2823,6453,"The Dal Rae is always excellent, from the hospitality to the food. Of course, you pay for it. I have tried many of their steaks and salads. All are fantastic. For my mother's birthday, we opted to have a family dinner at the Dal Rae. There were 7 of us. Salads, entrees, drinks and desserts totaled about $425. Like I said, it's pricey, but it's fantastic.When you pull up to the Dal Rae, they have valet parking. (There is a $3.50 service charge, by the way.) You open the large wooden door and enter to a dimly lit restaurant and lounge. To my knowledge, there aren't any windows, so it ALWAYS has the same feel to it. You feel like you walked into a scene of the Godfather.The staff is always very helpful and courteous and always on top of things. To paraphrase the great Ferris Bueller... It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend checking it out.",0
2824,6454,"I need to reconsider the star count of some other restaurants after eating at Dal Rae. Updated reviews to follow.Oh I'd been once or twice before, but for lunch. Dinner was amazing. I had prime rib (off the fatty end, which is the best cut according to the maitre'd who stopped by our table to compliment my choice... and it was so tender!) with garlic mashed potatoes. My dining companion (I feel like using old-timey words in my description of this distinctly old-fashioned place) ate the surf and turf, which consisted of a petite piece of Chilean sea bass a la Ben and a smaller version, but still sizeable, cut of pepper steak. We started off with chopped salad, which was like a hybrid tabbouleh and Cobb salad.Our table was by the kitchen; I didn't care and I didn't notice. I made the reservation through Yelp via OpenTable in under one minute. Loved it!The restaurant is very dark and romantic, definitely a great place for a dinner date or intimate meal. The food was excellent. I wouldn't have changed a thing, a taste, a dish. I wish I had avoided the bread at the beginning, because the cheese bread served with the chopped salad was so good (liken it to the garlic cheese bread from Clearman's Steak'n Stein).We finished off this meal, one of the best of my life (not just saying that because I had a particularly strong cocktail during the meal), with a Grand Marnier souffle. Order it at least 20-25 minutes before you expect to be finishing off your main course. Chocolate or Grand Marnier? Which do you most desire? Toughest question of the night, so glad I didn't say both. It was perfect, served with cream (add more to your liking) and prepared table side.The meal was between $100-$200, I avoided looking at the check. I always do that. Can't wait to go back! I plan to take my family for my dad's birthday. Better save up! And fast for the week leading up to the dinner.",0
2825,6455,"Thoroughly disappointed.....I've been wanting to try Dal Rae for years. I've heard from foodies all around that this place is classic.Even my counterparts/Chefs have spoke highly of Dal Rae.After tonight's visit, though I must say, the effort was there, but the delivery was not.Beautiful restaurant. Reminds me of The Ritz, or other classic 'ol school restaurants I've been.The Ketel soda was spot on. Perfect mixture.Service:The hostess. Very friendly and enthusiastic.Our server was nice and helpful. She seemed pretty new but put forth the effort.As we sat down, our wine was already opened. She asked if she could serve it. She then proceeded to fill our 6 glasses and pour it out completely. How does she know who drinks wine and who doesn't?She seemed to dissapear for lengthy periods.When she came back she took our app orders.Apps came and they were ok. See food review!I do like the way she offered salads/soups as a 2nd course. Spot on.There was a HUGE lag between 1st course and salad. Seemed like she forgot. I almost wanted to cancel it.Warm spinach salad was not really tableside. Done in a makeshift side station and given to us.Entrees came shortly thereafter-less of a lagtime.No real emphasis on dessert. She just generically asked.Food:Seafood platter. It was fair. I can't really expand, as I manage a Seafood restaurant and am afraid my opinion will be biased.Teriyaki filet tips: Tasted like they were braised in the sauce. Rather mushy and no real texture.Warm spinach salad: Should've made a meal of it. Best course besides cottage potatoes.Signature  New York ""Pepper Style"": The NY, topped with their signature mixture of peppers, scallions, bacon, etc. was a major disappointment. My steak was OVERCOOKED. Ordered charred, mid-rare, it came out charred. But definitely overcooked. My friend ordered the primerib midrare and it was ok. The NY did lack seasoning. Really needed some salt n pepper. The ""pepper style"" really didn't help season it.The Chateaubriand another ordered was PERFECTLY cooked mid-rare.The rice pilaf was fair to ok.The cottage potatoes were the best thing on the table at the time when we were eating our entrees.Dessert was a chocolate cake. Didn't try it. Not a dessert fan.The owner, I'm guessing, came by to ask how everything was. If he gave me the opportunity, I would've told him my steak was overcooked. But he was too busy to really stop by and sincerely ask how everything was! It was the mandatory, ""I don't really give a shit how your meal is, but it is my obligation to ask, though I don't care!"". He didn't even stop walking as he asked. Kind of funny. Not engaging at all.Will I be back? Maybe to try the Duck a 'la orange. But beside that, if they can't properly cook their signature item, can I trust them to properly cook a Osso Bucco? Don't think so.",0
2826,6456,It doesn't get better then the pepper steak. Meat just melts in your mouth. My family have been going for decades. I've gone for many special events and have never been unhappy with the service or the food. Great place to celebrate or have a quiet dinner.,0
2827,6457,"This place is timeless!  Amazing food, decor and service every time.  I can't wait to go again and again!",1
2828,6458,"I had the ""Poor-mans pepper steak"" and I heard a few laughs, lol.  The food was ok, for the price I wish i would have had larger portions and better flavor.  Others seemed to enjoy thier meal or think it was ok.  The atmosphere was nice, service was ok, valet parking outside, very ritzy type place with people you see at a country club.  If I ever go back, it would probably be to try and impress a date, just kidding, I will go back if I see a larger degree of raving reviews.",0
2829,6459,"We'd been wanting to try Dal Rae for some time. It was worth the wait! Delicious food, great atmosphere. Two of the older managers were very nice and didn't rush us out. The third manager.. younger (Hispanic??) not so much! He kept ""reminding"" our server Mary Jane - whom we absolutely loved,by the way- to get us some to go boxes. Even though we were looking at the dessert menu.  My suggestion: He needs to chill and let the servers do what they do best... Attend to the customer, without trying to rush them out the door. We will definitely be going again.  Just hopefully not when the younger manager is there.  Mary Jane was AWESOME! So was the food and service.",0
2830,6460,"If this was 1959 and you had a hot date then this might be a pretty happening place.  All the hipsters of that time would be yelping the heck out of it or I guess back then it was 'word of mouthing it'.  I have been going here off and on for I guess way too long as now I have to say it's become 'long of tooth'.I took six of us out for a nice dinner at Dal Rae's.  It's an old school restaurant with mirrors in the dinning room and a bar off to the side.  They start you off with an old fashioned vegetable tray which goes nicely with your drink.  I always order the Caesar Salad as they make it from scratch at your table (raw egg, anchovies, parmigian, lemon juice, etc).  It's sounds expensive at $16 but you can easily share it with 4 people.Normally, I usually just order a NY steak or and sometimes the white fish with beurre blanc (white wine butter).  The pepper steak sounds appealing as they say they are famous for it, but get the sauce on the side (I didn't like it) if you want to try it.  Their prime steaks are big, juicy, and good.  Not as good as the other top tier steak restaurants in this price range ($40 - $50).  The pasta is only okay, but good if you have kids (don't usually see kids in this place).  See, I started off by saying this place is getting old, but then I start thinking of that steak (my stomach is such a traitor).You might as well order the chocolate souffle up front if you try this place as it's one of the better items in the restaurant.  Cheese bread is okay, but I don't think it's necessary unless you're really starving.Oh, so back to our dinner.  It was just good, but not great.  The restaurant looks nice but seems run down in some way to me.  In LA with so many other great restaurants, I am sad to say I no longer be spending my restaurant dollars at Dal Rae's.  There are much better restaurants for the value.",1
2831,6461,"I really love this old school place. Once you enter the Dal Rae, you are immediately transported to another era. The inside has a dark 1930s lounge feel to it, and you can definitely get an intimate feel if you're not sitting in the main dining room. If you love food prepared table side, then this is an excellent place for you.My family used to take my Nana here for a trip down memory lane, so we always order the oysters on the half shell. Very common in her era. They bring a nice relish try, bread, and spreads. I'm obsessed with caesar salad, and this place makes a top notch, table side one. The best.The service here is old-fashioned...in a good way! It's very personalized, and many of these waitresses have been doing this their whole life. They serve up great meat entrees, although they also do serve pasta type dishes. A few of the dishes can serve two, especially the rack of lamb - my family's favorite. Head here for a blast from the past.",0
2832,6462,"Too much hype, for the mediocre food they serve. Their customer service needs improvement. I wouldn't recommend this place.",1
2833,6463,"Follow me into another realm, a place of old memories and lost time, where we sit back remising and wishing we could relive the past.Step through the large doors with me, letting the cool air envelop you and your stomach guide you to a seat. Order a drink and join me in a toast, so that we may begin this beautiful journey of culinary feats in the proper fashion.It is the stomach that will triumph the mind in the course of tonight's adventure, as we begin down a path....Wait, what exactly am I talking about?? This is supposed to be a restaurant review and yet I am providing you with useless fluff to describe a place to fill one's face. But alas my fellow culinary junkies, it is a place like Dal Rae that would create such a reaction in us....Dal Rae Restaurant is quite a place. Driving down Washington Blvd in Pico Rivera you would not think the shabby restaurant next to the Jack in the Box was home to a wonderful restaurant. In fact, if you were driving by Dal Rae, you would look at in disgust as it reminds you of old rundown bowling alleys, filled with rancid tobacco smoke and stale bowling shoes.But do not let the facade fool you, as this is home to a very good restaurant. Having heard about Dal Rae from Yelp, I decided to try it. The inside is nothing like its rundown exterior, as the Dal Rae is a cavernous restaurant filled with shiny black leather booths. When we entered the restaurant, there was one other couple. We sat down, ordered drinks and began to contemplate our appetizers. Our waitress was really friendly and was being assisted by a new waitress....The drinks came within minutes and the mood began to set.We were not in a hurry.......The appetizers were a great start, I ordered the Escargot which was a great dish, as the snails were still in their shell and lightly covered in buttery oil sauce. Following the appetizers, we had soup, French onion, which was hot but not hot enough to burn our mouths. For dinner I ordered the pepper steak, medium rare, and garlic mashed potatoes. The steak was huge and covered in a delectable pepper sauce along with sauted vegetables. My garlic mashed potatoes were also very good. Desert was next and I shared cherries jubilee, which was a great way to cap off the evening.By the time we left, most of the booths were filled and the bar was packed. This was a great treat and a restaurant I would suggest for anyone. The menu is large, but not overbearing and the atmosphere is exciting. In fact my college graduation is in a week and this is where I will be going for the post lunch celebration.",0
2834,6464,"For the price that we paid for this dinner, I should've just stayed home. I sent the oysters back because they were disgusting. Then when my $45 filet Mignon came to the table, it was almost cold. Considering how hungry I was, I ate it with the cheap steak sauce they provided me. paid the bill and decided never to come back. At least get some A1 sauce! Cheap!",0
2835,6465,"This place is definitely a place to enjoy with your significant other! My husband and I went here for our anniversary and the first thing we thought about the restaurant was ""Really, in Pico Rivera!???"". His main thought and consideration for the place was the fact that I love everything about the 50's era so this place was known for the shi shi 50's decor, menu and atmosphere...Well, I gave it a chance--plus I had to do a sneak peek on their website, which needs a bit of modern updating... still informative though.Definitely no scenic route getting there - but when we arrived, everything was wonderful... Starting with the on cue valet service and retro Dal Rae sign...Definitely had the 50's shi shi feel...The food. The food was so gooooood! We had...Appetizer: Oysters Rockefeller (Chopped Bacon, Spinach, Pernod, Parmesan and Hollandaise Sauce)Husband: Lobster Thermidor, Dal Rae (Over 1 Pound of Lobster Sauteed with Mushrooms and Onions, Cream Sauce, Hollandaise and Parmesan Cheese, Served in the Shell)Me: the Dal Rae Famous Pepper Steak--the ""Prime New York"" one...and stated on their site--LA Magazine's Top 100 Tastes of LA...""Often Copied, Never Equaled""Dessert:  It's not on the website's menu, but it was some souffle that they recommended, it was absolutely delicious!!! a definite MUST HAVE!!!Everything was yummy, delicious, succulent, scrumptious, etc etc etc!",1
2836,6466,"I too am guilty for juding a book by its cover.  When I found out my company dinner was at a steak house in Pico Rivera, i was thinking WTF? I dont wana be mugged by some crazy gangstas while i eat.Boy was I wrong! As soon as I stepped inside, I felt like I was in a different world, let alone a different city.  The ambience and mood inside the place surpasses mortons and lawrys and all those fancy schmancy places.  The food was DELICIOUS!  I tried a few appetizers (forgot which ones b/c its been so long) but I do remember the ahi on toast appetizer.  It was seriously SOOoOo good.  I felt like such a fatass cuz i was devouring those while everyone else was making small talk and waiting for the entrees.  The black pepper steak was probably one of the best steaks I've had, and under $40 for a large cut!  I know this place is out there in booneyville, especially to those of u on the west side.  But I truly consider Del Rae a diamond in the rough.",0
2837,6467,"Night two of DineLA, three course prix fix dinner for $34.  How can I resist?  This was the perfect opportunity for me to try the Dal Rae, which has been on my to-try list for the longest time.It was great that the Dal Rae's DineLA menu offered three choices for the three courses.  Since I was with two friends, we decided to order each of the appetizers and desserts so that we could try everything.  The first appetizer was fried calamari.  It was good but the best thing about it was the lemon butter sauce that accompanied the dish.  Oh so bad for you, but lordy, it was oh so good!  The second appetizer was artichokes stuffed with dungeness crab and topped with hollandaise sauce.  Tasty, though a bit rich.  The third appetizer was ahi sashimi on toast with remoulade, capers, onions and feta cheese.  Everything on the toast was great but the quality of the ahi fell a little short.  I was pretty much full after appetizers.  When we first sat down, we were given a large basket of bread that contained sliced sourdough and pita chips.  I was disappointed that the bread wasn't warmed but I was ravenous and dug into that basket undeterred.  They also provided a dish of crudites and during our appetizers, they offered a basket of toasted cheese bread.Though my belly was 90% full after appetizers, I pushed onward and sampled my entree, a petite pepper filet mignon.  It was perfectly cooked medium rare and was topped with a delicioius pepper sauce that had diced scallions and what appears to be bacon bits.  The dish came with a side of mixed veggies as well as garlic mashed potatoes.  I was given a choice of the mashed potatoes or rice pilaf or a baked potato.  The mixed veggies and mashed potatoes were standard.  By the time dessert rolled around, I was ready to be rolled out of the restaurant.  We had creme brulee, tiramisu, and gold brick sundae.  You know how sometimes you're so full, nothing tastes good even though it may?  That was where I was at.  I took a single bite of each dessert just to try them.  I am not a fan of dessert so that's no big loss to me.  The desserts were nothing special.  Everyone's favorite was the gold brick sundae.  It was a scoop of vanilla ice cream encased in chocolate, in a crisp basket.  I swear, the chocolate reminded me of ""magic shell"",  you know that gooey topping you put on your ice cream when you were a kid and it magically hardened up?Our server had to be the nicest and friendliest I've had in awhile.  She welcomed us at our booth and when I indicated that it was my first time, she said, ""great, we're so glad to have you!""  She periodically checked on us and at the end of the meal, she asked if I was happy with my experience and said she hopes I'll come again.  For 34 buckaroos, it was an awesome dinner.  If you can get in on the action before DineLA is over, do it!  However, I don't know if I'd go back and shell out full price because, while I thought the food was good, I did not think it was great.",0
2838,6468,"This restaurant has the WORST valet service.  They absolutely have NO respect for your car.  There is a speed bump 10 feet from where you have to get out of your car and this driver went so fast in that 10 feet, he bottomed out my car!!   When I picked up my car, once again he raced out of the parking spot.   I made a comment to him that it wasn't a race car and he just laughed at me.   So direspectful.    Will not be going back there since there is no self park option",0
2839,6469,"For 2 Christmas', my company sprang for lunch at this place.  It had a nice old school feel to it, reminiscent of a place that the original Rat Pack would have frequented, if only it weren't in Pico Rivera. I could wax poetic on the other stuff like the food and service, but I just took a muscle relaxant, so I don't feel so inclined to do it.",1
2840,6470,I haven't been to Del Rae in years......I used to go with a group of people from work.   They have fantastic steaks and fish!  I remember there was once one in Orange County (Fullerton) but it closed down many years ago.I highly recommend the Del Rae to everyone no matter where you live.,1
2841,6471,"My wife and I finally had the opportunity to eat at Del Rea. We've been together 17 years, lived in Pico Rivera for 21, and never went to eat there. Well we did and it was just great. The Filet Mignon was just perfect, easy to cut and melts in your mouth. Great price and very affordable. The ambiance was lively and happening, as some might say. Not too dressy nor too casual attire, more in the middle of both is what we saw and we wore. Service was above ok. The end of our dinner was great because the desert was the best part. Would definitely recommend to eat here and invite people, i think you will enjoy it.",0
2842,6472,"Hidden restaurant in the middle of nowhere! You would not suspect this as a restaurant from the exterior as classy nor elegant, but right when you step through the door, your whole outlook will change. I went during lunch and was told by 2 people I went with the Sea Bass a la Ben is awesome. I took their suggestion and I THANK THEM.  Delicious! I was expecting a light dish, but surprisingly it was very filling because it is prepared with light crust of cheese and topped with crispy, fried onions. I have to say again...superb!This is definitely one hidden treasure!",0
2843,6473,"I'm writing this review from my table, that's how disappointed I am. The decor is very cool, but the service and food leave much to be desired. I realize its Mother's Day. I also realize that a restaurant of this supposed caliber should be prepared for that. Especially as everyone who came in tonight had reservations.My evening started with a request for a wine list. The server walked off with a zombie like vague expression and got one, then wandered back off. 10 minutes later she came back over and asked what I would like, I ordered the Wild Horse Pinot Noir. My glass never came, it never came! I waited patiently since the room was packed and service was obviously in the weeds, but my wine never came. Later I brought it to the attention of my server but she told me, and I quote, 'I have no recollection of this, I'm sorry. Can I get it for you now?' Um,  no because my meal is nearly over.My lobster bisque was burnt and awful, sent that one back and my veal Oscar was overlooked and bland. I imagine it would work well for senior citizens, but not anyone with a functioning palate.Look, this place probably sees better days, maybe this was a bad one. But I'm guessing the food is meh on most days so I don't see how I'd want to drag myself back to Pico Rivera to find out. And this joint DEFINITELY doesn't rank me coming out of hibernation to review on my website.Two stars, but only because one seems too mean. I have no clue how they average four. Palate not rocked, not even close.",0
2844,6474,"First off, I think It is odd that they have valet in such a small parking lot. however, once you walk in it has a nice warm olden day setting. We were greeted right away.Once your seated you get served with a variety of bread with butter and pickled vegetables.We started off with a red cabernet savignon and a dozen oysters on a half shell. They scored high with me as their oysters were my favorite fany bay.  I ordered the peppered petit filet mignon with garlic mash and was soo delicious. However, i tasted the sea bass and that was so flavorful I wished i ordered that instead.I heard the veal is great but thought it was too cruel to order it.For dessert we tried their famous banana flambe and it was prepared table side. VERY delicious, you couldn't even taste the liquor in it There aren't words to describe how great it was!The evening was great, food was amazing, and LYDIA our waitress couldn't of been better.Always grateful when restaurants like these score high all around for ambiance, service, taste, and presentation. So grateful I wrote this review right when I got home.",0
2845,6475,"We celebrated our 7 years anniversary here, the service was great. Our food was so delicious. Our waitress was awesome, she offered to take photos of us, gave us a free desert for our anniversary and always refilled our drinks before we even asked. The setting is dark with candles light. Romantic Great place to celebrate any occasion.",0
2846,6476,"The Dal Rae is such a hidden gem! I've been going there with my family since I was a baby and almost 30 years later, it's my go-to spot for a nice prime rib! The table side Caesar salad is amazing and always get the oysters Rockefeller! I make the hike from Newport to Pico Rivera every year and it never disappoints.",0
2847,6477,"Very Impressed, my wife took me here when we were dating and I was very happy from start to finish.I had the NY, an she had the fish.Grill cook is the most important part of the puzzle aside from the meat. So, it's a good Idea to go when the best grill guy is working. Rule of thumb (coming from a chef) most times the place will have their best grill guy working  the weekends. So, avoid Monday, Tuesday, and you can chance Wednesday. Percentage wise 1% chance he'll call in sick.",0
2848,6478,"So far everything I've had here is delicious. But for those eyeing the duck platter, just note the waitress was very candid in expressing it wasn't their best dish. Besides the good service, Dal Rae is known for their generis pours. If you are an open table user, you can find this place for 1,000 points when you make a reservation. If you aren't, then I highly recommend calling ahead of time. Especially if you're with a large group or during the holiday seasons.",0
2849,6479,"Defiantly not coming back again!  I was here because of the dine LA promotion. The waitress here does not want to give us the dine LA Manu at all. When we asked for it, she gave us a ""so cheap"" look. Then, we start receiving the worst service ever. Fir example, was waiting 15 mins fir her to come back to takeout order....The food here was very disappointed. Just like most of the review here staying: can find much much better food for that expensive price.I am love to try all new restaurants with good review on Yelp, however, I am so so so regretted for Dal Rae",1
2850,6480,Probably the only good/upscale place in Pico Rivera...lol. Hope the cholo's/chola's don't see this. The drinks are very strong and they have amazing food here. Order the crab claws in Italian dressing and the filet Mignon steaks are amazing. They also have a great piano guy here. Plays a lot of the old jams for us elderly type...lol.,0

2853,6483,"Wanted to try a new steak place and found this listed on a blog of top steak houses in Los Angeles. Considering it is pretty close to home, decided to give it a try. I made reservations through Open Table for 9pm and arrived a few minutes early. We were given a pager and told we should be seated shortly. However we weren't seated until close to 9:30. At least we were able to enjoy the live music near the bar area while we waited.After we were seated, we were promptly given water and our waitress arrived to take our drink order. She then brought us the relish tray of fresh veggies on ice and bread selection. I loved the veggies, especially the cherry peppers and the pickles. Ordered the parmesan crusted Chilean sea bass ($37.50) and bone in ribeye ($46.95). I really wanted to try the surf and turf which has smaller portions of both the sea bass and filet mignon with the famous pepper sauce, but that dish is $62 (off the menu but the waitress told us about it). The food came about 25 minutes after we ordered. But the food was so worth the wait! The sea bass was a huge portion, about 10oz, and was absolutely delicious, fresh, rich and buttery and with a perfect parmesan crust. It was topped with onions and a buttery sauce. It was served with a side of the largest asparagus I've ever seen lol. I asked for broccoli instead of potato. The ribeye was also super delicious, very juicy and flavorful. The mashed potatoes tasted very fresh, mixed with roasted garlic.The waitstaff was pretty attentive and the drinks were refilled promptly. The waitress also check in on us often without being intrusive. She even offered to walk me to the restroom when I asked where it was.Overall I was pleased with the experience here. The restaurant definitely could be easily missed from the street, as it kind of sits by itself right next to a Jack in the Box. It's located on Washington and Rosemead, just east of Rosemead on the left hand side. They have valet parking and charge $3.50. Seems there's not much choice except to valet, as I didn't see street parking and wasn't familiar with the area. The valet staff does their job well, and take and retrieve your car very quickly. Don't forget  the restaurant keeps the $3.50 so please don't complain that you have to tip them on top of that, isn't that the polite and customary thing to do? After all, they're doing their job and have to stand in the cold (it was probably 50 degrees last night) and run around getting cars.I'd give the place 5 stars if it wasn't for the wait to get seated and forced valet. The inside decor is also very nice, live music Thurs through Sat and good service, most of all, great food. I'll definitely plan to try the filet mignon next time.",0
2854,6484,"THE BEST STEAKHOUSE IN LA...PERIODOh how I miss the Dal Rae.  If I worked for Merriam-Webster, I'd put a description of the Dal Rae under 'steakhouse'.  This is how steak houses were meant to be with comfy leather booths, rich hardwood finishes, amazing food, impeccable service, and undeniable style and class.  You almost expect to look over to the next booth and see Sinatra downing a martini.How many places these days prepare the classics like lobster thermidore, oysters rockefeller, and steak diane?Must Have's:-THE PEPPER STEAK (This would be my last meal on Earth; a massive cut of prime filet mignon cooked to perfection with a peppery bacon and scallion topping that is making my mouth water as we speak)-Caesar Salad Table-side (Get the anchovies you wimp)-Sea Bass ala Ben (If you must take a non beef-eater with you, have them get this dish)-Oysters Rockefeller (a classic)-Oysters on the Half Shell (Served with fresh grated horseradish)This is someplace you MUST visit in LA.  It's worth the drive to Pico.",0
2855,6485,"After almost 2 hrs of driving from the SFV on a weeknight, I was ready to eat! Too bad I had to wait since we were there before our reserved time. As we waited, we were entertained by a lady on the piano and singing all the Sinatra-era songs that I know and loved.  The whole time I was there, I kept thinking the Rat Pack was going to show up and do a surprise show. One can wish.I went during DineLA:Restaurant Week and kept to the menu.My orders:Calamari -- perfect, not too much breading and comes with delicious lemon butter cream sauce.Duck L'orange -- since I wanted to see them flambee it. It was pretty neat, but tastewise it was just OK, I thought it's a little too liquor-y for me. I could've sworn I was a little buzzed by the end of the night.Creme Brulee -- was just a'ight. The burnt sugar on top was too thick that it was hard to crack.  Next time I'll try the banana flambee.My partner in crime:Crab stuffed artichoke -- rich and light (eh?) and delicious!Petite Filet Mignon -- not so petit mignon compared to shi-shi LA restaurant. Meat is not the most tender, but it's good. My partner really liked it.  I can see how people might not like the cracked peppers and green onions so much.Tiramisu -- too sweet, too much bread and not enough cheese mixture.For all the ""tableside"" services they do here, this place is definitely worth the repeat visits.  From the flambees to the baked potatoes. They've got their waiters workin' for ya!I look forward to coming back.",0
2856,6486,"Steak houses usually are not my cup of tea.  Trying to be healthier I've been avoiding large portions of meat, especially red meat.  However my friend has been a patron of Dal Rae for the past 10 years and always pushes me to go.The atmosphere is fantastic.  It definitely has the feel and look of a classic steak house straight from the Godfather or from the tv show Mad Men.  The first thing you will notice is the wonderful garlicky aroma in the air.  That is from one of the most popular dishes, their wilted spinach salad, which is prepared and sauteed tableside with copious amounts of balsamic vinegar and bacon.I wouldn't recommend getting it every time but for steak lovers you have to try the diamond jim cut prime rib at least once.  It's ginormous and will make you uncomfortable when you finish but my what a treat it is.  It's easily one of the juiciest and tastiest prime rib you'll have.  If you are looking for something lighter their filet's are fantastic.  Tender enough that even when they overcook it you can still cut it up with a fork.  The scallion and bacon topping is just icing on the cake.  Though I haven't tried it yet I've been told by some Dal Rae vets to avoid the seafood.  My friend got the king crab legs and was disappointed with the quality and taste saying it wasn't very meaty for king crab.  I did try the artichoke hearts stuffed with dungeness crab. The tartness of the artichoke was a nice compliment to the cream sauce and crab.  Their side dishes and desserts are also noteworthy.  Their garlic mash potatoes is amazing and their bread and pita baskets make fantastic starters.  If you have room in your stomach try their exquisite desserts, my favorite is the creme brulee.If you are looking for a great steak forget the chains like Ruth Chris, Mortons and Flemmings, check this place out.  It will not disappoint.5-1-08 Update:I had the pleasure of going back to Dal Rae not once but twice in the last 5 days.  Their prime rib is once again as delectable as always.  However I did get to try some new menu items that blew me away.  Their brie appetizer was amazing.  The baked brie is just smothered with a mix of pesto, pine nuts, garlic and sun dried tomatoes and comes with a good number of garlic toast pieces.  In addition to that we also ordered their shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp tasted fresh and nicely prepared.  To top off our meal we had the chocolate souflee which was delicate and just mouth watering.",0
2857,6487,"The quality of food, service and ambiance at Dal Rey restaurant make it my favorite place to dine, especially with my group of geezer friends. The atmosphere creates a sence of time travel to a by gone era.",1
2858,6488,Highly recommend the Bass and Lobster Thermidor with a Cobbler dessert. Flavor explosion with attentive servers. No better place for business or family lunch. Driving home satisfied and can't wait to go back.,0
2859,6489,"I have been here half a dozen times. Love the retro decor which is mostly original, I think. The menu feels like it has been the same since the day the place opened. Everything I have eaten here is always very good. They bring out the veggie platter on ice before dinner just like they did at nice restaurants years ago. Great prime rib. Oh, and they make STRONG drinks here, martinis the old fashioned way! My only complaint is that the last two times I went the service was atrocious - truly an embarrassment for a nice establishment like this. The last time I went the waitress acted like it was the biggest burden in the world to serve us. This is completely opposite to the first time I ever came and felt like I was royalty.",0
2860,6490,"The first time I went here the food and service was fantastic. I brought my department for the holidays and it was lacking. We couldn't get seated without our last person, so we all stood and waited. My drink was rarely filled, an order was wrong, veggies hard as rock and the rest of the meal so-so. If you go here avoid the holidays. It's more friendly and the menu is bigger and better at other times of the year.",1
2861,6491,"Went here for a client lunch because really - not many great places in the area.  Was pleasantly surprised at the old-school vibe of the ambiance.  It definitely brings you back to the dark steakhouse feel.  Needless to say, I did not have steak. We started off the meal with the Ahi Sashimi on toast (pretty good for ahi) and the baked brie (loved it!).  I had a cup of their lobster bisque (which was quite good).  My main entree was the Seafood Brochette ($16.95) which had fresh fish, shrimp, scallops - in a garlic butter sauce - over rice! ... c'mon, garlic butter!! How can you go wrong?! I was definitely pleased with my dish and would go back to the restaurant if ever in the area for other client meetings!My one complaint though is that you HAVE to valet....",0
2862,6492,"Simply one of my best lifetime experiences. Was taken here for my birthday back in January. A throwback to the places where my Dad actually worked as a waiter in the 50s and 60s. Dark and classy, even with the dulcet tones of a Negro in the corner of the bar at the piano (just like the 1950s).Service was extraordinary, but not stuffy. Owner came around himself to check on us TWICE. He  was very gracious. Food was exceptional, both in preparation and in aroma and flavor. Spinach Salad Flambe. Combination with Pepper steak  (filet mignon with finely chopped green onions and peppercorns and bacon) and Chilean Sea Bass. WOW, a premiere surf and turf! Nice sides. Excellent bread. Wonderful complimentary birthday dessert (and we ordered Bananas Foster too). Great retro atmosphere. THEY SERVED ME LAPHROIAG SCOTCH!!!! We actually did the suit and tie thing for the occasion, but most people were more casual. (One longtimer was there in shorts and t-shirt.....that was probably a little much).We were treated wonderfully and will definitely return. I've seen several reviews here from other minorities that said they didn't felt like they were treated right. While I know that happens from time to time in restaurants (and believe me, I had my radar set for catching this), too often it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. We were in our early 50s and dressed appropriately for this place (suit and tie), and we were treated with the utmost courtesy, respect and prompt considerate service. Notice how you can go to a club in Hollywood and the guy in the tux who exudes sophistication will always get past the velvet rope? Sort of the same thing here. Even though everyone should be treated equally no matter what age or ethnicity and how they are dressed, more often than not, if you treat the establishment with extraordinary respect, the servers and managers will echo that right back to you.Prices were high for us (we went all out with booze and wine and appetizers and salad and steak) but worth it for the occasion), but you can actually eat at the Dal Rae for $20 a person. It was actually a diverse menu that would appeal to several income brackets.I really really enjoyed the experience. I thought all these places were GONE. But the Dal Rae is still there, just as casual classy as ever, and with a complete retro feel but with a menu that has its foot in the current century (just a hint) as well as the last. That's fine with me.",1
2863,6493,"A surprisingly classic and elegant fine dining restaurant located in the heart of Pico Rivera, Dal Rae offers a very exquisite menu that foodies of all types will enjoy. The food here is just divine, the service is superb and the whole experience will make you wanting to plan for your next return!Dal Rae's menu consists of American/French continental dishes, from steaks, seafood, delightful salads and soups and mouth-watering desserts. My date brought me here for a birthday dinner and I have to express my greatest thanks from the bottom of my heart for such a wonderful experience - this place IS truly fantastic! :)We ordered the french onion soup, Escargots Bourguignon, Lobster Thermidor with rice pilaf and Dal Rae's Famous Pepper Steak with garlic mashed potatoes. Super yummy! The Lobster Theridor was so rich and creamy, it was like devouring yourself into heaven (yes, seriously!). The pepper steak was so moist, tasty and delicious like a fine piece of chocolate. Oh, and I am a MAJOR mashed potatoes fan and the garlic mash was very good!After dinner, one of the owners of the restaurant came by our table and greeted us. It was a very good experience and he was nice, as he asked us by our names.I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to enjoy a beautiful dining experience. I would recommend dressing up as well. After all, it's a fine dining restaurant! But I do have to warn you that it's not a cheap place. It's about a $$$$ restaurant, but worth while for special occasions or if you feel like spending your winnings from a recent Vegas trip or something. :)",0
2864,6494,"This area is looking up!  With a movie theatre and massive new plaza close by this place is definately getting recognition.  It's known for steaks and fine dining.  There are a lot of old timers here but that's because it's established as a fine restaurant for many years... and the retirement home close by.  Try the pepper steak  with it's generous portions  you can't go wrong, the sea bass has generous portions and fresh!, the grilled salmon was very tasty but on the small side, the salads are very very huge, the prime rib is the best thing on the menu big portions and very very juicy.  There are no gangsters around the restaurant but just on the safe side, ""I'll park my own car mr. plain clothes valet guy.""",0
2865,6495,"Extremely poor service. The food was good, until the already rude waitress notifies us the kitchen had finished the mash potaoes. How does that happen at a steak house? We also waited an hour despite our reservations. I will not be coming back.  If you expect great steak and great service, go to Clearmans on Whittier. I've never had a bad experience at Clearmans! Oh, and Del Rae charges their customers for valet.Over priced and terrible service.",0
2866,6496,Epic steaks.  Old school steak house glamour.  And CHEESE TOAST.  Dal Rae is one of the great old-school Los Angeles area steakhouses.  Their signature pepper steak is great!  Not to mention the theater of tableside prepared dishes.  This is now in my regular rotation of steakhouses.,0
2867,6497,"My experience at the Dal Rae has always been 5 stars.  The Dal Rae has excellent food, thoughtful service and great atmosphere.The oysters Rockefeller are decedent and a must order.  I love the famous pepper steak but I've also enjoyed the lobster thermidor (not for faint of heart or calorie watchers!).  Even though you think you're full, you must order the grand mariner souffle.  Its worth the wait.  Now that I hit the highlights I need to go on a bit about the pepper steak.  Lately I've been chowing down on some amazing Omaha prime and I can tell you that the Dal Rae measures up very well.  I really enjoy the pepper steak, its unique and flavorful.  There is a reason its famous and people like Nancy Silverton give it praise.  One last very random thing:  They make their own crackers and the triangle, spicy ones are so good they are actually on my list of SoCal things I'm missing right now.",0
2868,6498,"This place is pretty nice inside- lots of christmas lights and it's so noisy and fun. There is a karaoke bar on one side and on the other, I can hear a piano playing somewhere. Let me repeat- very noisy!The menu was kind of limited. I was not satisfied with what they had to offer- one pasta, two types of steak, a few seafood dishes and a pork dish. It was pricey  but the food was good. We were there for two hours- the service was really slow and the check took about 1/2 an hour to get to us. We sent the pork back twice because it was undercooked, and it was still undercooked! ( I like my beef to be medium rare, but I'd say pork is a different story)Is it selfish to give two stars because of the service? The waitress was nice, but just really inattentive. The ambience is nice- say, birthday party/bachelorette. I wouldn't recommend for a quiet date.",1
2869,6499,"Simply 5 stars. I was looking for a Steakhouse close to my hotel and this popped up. I decided to give it a shot and when I was driving towards the restaurant, I looked a bit worried because it looked like a run down mom and pop restaurant. When I arrived I was greeted by valet parking and I was like ""what is going on? are they going to steal my car?"", I finally opened the doors and I was simply amazed.I eventually was seated and ordered their Filet Mignon Pepper Steak, which came with a bunch of bread and a vegetable platter on the side. I ordered Garlic Mashed Potatoes and simply loved itps: the Maiter'D and the waitress were awesome, and the customers were really nice, I met two families and they said they've been coming there for 30 years.pss: they have garlic bread but you have to ask for it, the local customers told me about it, it was a nice additional treat!Come here if you're in LA",0
2870,6500,"This rating is only for fans of old-school restaurants. If you love the time capsule vibe of places like Musso & Frank or Tam O'Shanter, you may want to think twice about venturing down to Pico Rivera for the Dal Rae. For despite being at this location since 1958, the interior is now very slick and contemporary. The only mid-century remnants are the brick mantelpiece in the foyer and the spirograph details on the ceiling lamps.We only went to the bar for drinks. Friendly service, but well cocktails were overpriced at $12. This is Pico Rivera, not Hollywood! But we enjoyed the live music, which was basically some dude playing karaoke versions of classic soul on his laptop, and singing along with joy. Not for all tastes, but we found him charming.Beware: the huge parking lot is valet-only (at least on weekends), and street parking on Washington and/or Rosemead is literally impossible. Best you can do is Bequette Ave., a tiny side street with a slightly sketchy air.",1
2871,6501,What a great steak house!!  Amazing!! Food is excellent and the staff is friendly. We love our waiter Robert. He went out of his way to make sure we had a great dinner and made my grandmother feel like a queen as we celebrated her birthday.. We will definitely be back.,0
2872,6502,"Pico Rivera!?!Good food, good portions, good price, nice place, ugly neighborhood.I ordered the New York Steak for two and ,oh my, was it a lot of food.They gave us this huge slab of steak weighing several pounds. It comes with many side vegetables. The stuff artichoke bottoms and rock shrimp were awesome as well.Oh yea, but don't make my mistake and order appetizers with the dinner for two. She warned us that it would take 45 minutes to prepare so by the time the food was ready we were kind of full. Especially because I ate so much filling food such as bread, the breaded shrimp and cheesy stuffed artichoke bottoms.A lot of older people eat here because I guess they like the whole 50s thing going on. I was born in the mid 80's so I had no idea how the decor was like in the 50s.",0
2873,6503,"RETRO charm!  I had Steak Diane here, cherries jubilee served flambeed tableside.  The bar looks like something straight outta the '50's.  And I found the food to be still good.  In all the years it hasn't deteriorated as so many older classic restaurants tend to do.  There's so few of these oldies type places that have survived in L.A.  I hope it lasts many more years.  They've done a good job with remodeling and yet keeping the retro look.  I've never had a chance to return.  The steak Diane had a lot of sauce on it, and I'd like to try one of their other types of steak.  This place would be great for a group special celebration because of the unique atmosphere.",0
2874,6504,"Came here with a large group of people for some birthdays in our party. This place is like walking back into the 50s/60s. Really makes you feel like you're hanging out with the Rat Pack. We started our evening with martinis and then made it over to our table.The waitstaff served us very well. We ordered the tableside caesar salad. It was great! I ordered the ahi tuna, which was cooked perfectly. They provided me with wasabi and soy sauce so I could make my own sushi-esque sauce. My husband ordered the pepper steak. He said it was very good and was glad he ordered it based on recommendations from others. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals. For dessert, we ordered the Grand Mariner soaked strawberries. These were sooooooo goooooooood!!!! Totally loved them. Would recommend that to anyone else looking for a unique dessert. Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu offerings.",0
2875,6505,"This place never fails. Always great food!The pepper steak always great to eat.Oysters for an appetizer you can't go wrong, cocktails are great and love the bar section were they have a gentleman playing the piano",1
2876,6506,"Solid steakhouse, but chopped salad - which gets excellent reviews - wasn't anything special.  Steak bit appetizers were completely underwhelming.  Nice ambiance, and crudites and cheese bread were welcome additions.  Service was excellent.",1
2877,6507,"Very disappointed! We went last night, 2/16/18 and had reservations at 8:30 pm. It was very busy, which is understandable for a Friday evening just after Valentine's Day. However, we were sat in what seemed to be an enclosed patio. The noise level was so high we couldn't even hear each other speak. I asked the hostess if we could move into the dining room and she said we'd have to wait until all the other reservations and walk-ins were seated. I couldn't believe it. So we chose to stay where we were. We ordered our food. Waited forever to get our drinks. Our server was very nice but very busy. Finally got our food and drinks. I ordered the fillet mignon and my husband the Chilean sea bass. He loved his. My steak didn't have much flavor. The noise level continued to be that of a sport's bar, no exaggeration. The managers catered to the large parties. We were so looking forward to our dinner here as our friends raved about it for many years. I've had much better food and atmosphere at other places. Seriously when you pay that amount for a fine dining experience, you expect to be able to have a conversation without people yelling and howling like they were at a sporting event. Been here, tried it, won't be back.",0
2878,6508,"My husband and I absolutely love this place for various reasons. The food is delicious but the ambiance is also a big part of the dining experience. My favorite server Carrie always makes dining here a delight!My favorites are the ahi sashimi on toast with avocado, escargot ,Chilean sea bass, filet mignon pepper steak however, I've never been dissapointed with anything I've ever eaten here!",0
2879,6509,"We came here for dineLA this time but we've been here a number of times before.Atmosphere - 3 stars - you feel like you're in an old school steak house in N.Y., not in Pico Rivera.Dirty Martini - 5 stars - they really know how to make it right!Waitress - 4 stars - she was attentive but made the mistake of leaving our friend sitting there with an empty cocktail glass.  She made up for it later.Pickled peppers & veggies - 3 starsBread & crackers - 3 starsAhi Tuna on toast - 2 stars - not really a combo that worked for me.Artichoke - 2 stars - it was really watery and not a lot of meat on the leaves.Caesar salad - 5 stars - the fact that they make it old school table side from scratch and that it is delicious!  This was not part of dineLA but totally worth the extra $$!Dal Rae Petite Filet Mignon Pepper Steak - 5 stars - perfectly cooked medium rare, so juicy, tender and tasty.Baked potato - 4 starsChocolate fantasy - 5 starsTiramisu - 4 starsIt would have ranked higher if I just had my Dirty Martini, Caesar Salad, Dal Rae Petite Filet Mignon Pepper Steak, baked potato, & Chocolate Fantasy.",1
2880,6510,Fantastic experience. Went here with clients last night. We shut down shop. The drinks at the bar are extremely strong  I got the sea bass and the bottom was a little crusted. Wow! My team got the filet and we shared a little. Both to die for. It's an old spot but really really neat. I would defiantly come back if I was ever in that area. The owner made our salad and desert,1
2881,6511,"I'm really surprised that this place has any ratings at all.  Most of the people who like it probably have never used an electric typewriter, let alone a computer.Dal Rae.  Steak.  Weird horse-racing-related decor.  People talking about stuff you don't care about.",1
2882,6512,"Awesome place! My honey took me out to this restaurant last Friday night and I had one of the best steak dinners ever. The restaurant is circa Lake Tahoe in Godfather 2, so I loved it the minute we walked in.We were seated at a nice table that had a view of the entire dining room. It was like we were Micheal and Kate. The place was packed for a late Friday night, and all their holiday decors were up.From their holiday menu, we chose to skip the appetizer and just start with the entree'.We both picked the DalRae specialty, a Filet Mignon and the Prime NY Pepper Steak. I had the Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and he had the Baked Potato.Before our steaks arrived, Jasmine our fab waitress, started us off with their Ceasars Salad. This was the best Ceasars I have had. It was prepared table side, the salad was creamy and you can taste the slight hint of anchovies in the dressing. This is the way Ceasars should be. Soon after, our steaks arrived. Jasmine fixed up my honey's baked potato while we stared at the big, juicy pieces of meat laid in front of us. I take my first bite, and melted in the booth we sat in. It was cooked perfectly. That was a damn tasty steak. I tried to finish it, but it was pretty big for 1/4 lb Filet Mignon, so I took some of it home.I would have liked dessert, but unfortunately I had no room for it in my stomach. So next time, I will order a Banana Flambe' . And yes honey, there will be a next time.",0
2883,6513,"Lawry's Who? Mastro's What?  Dal Rae is DELISH!My first impression on the location of the restaurant was a bit off because it is literally between a Jack in the Box and broken down motel. The mandatory valet makes me laugh considering the lot probably fits about 15 cars and the walk is no longer then 50 feet.Once you step inside, it's a 60's throwback atmosphere. The waitress was very nice and down to earth. She provided the table with vegetables and break sticks.From everyone's yelp review - I HAD to try the Peppersteak. I must admit, I am not into the typical salt and pepper grilled steak but at Dal Rae, it made me smile! WOW, it was DELICIOUS! The juicy caramelized green onions and sauce made this steak super awesome! As a side, I got the garlic mashed potatoes and added a little mix to it by adding the mouth watering onions from the steak onto the potatoes. Life doesn't get any better then this.I would recomend this place to anyone for a special event, birthday - just case you want to splurge! Happy eating!",0
2884,6514,"I LOVE this place. I typically can't afford a smooth restaurant like this, but my favorite time of year to go is during DINE LA so I can savor the flavor of a quality Dal Rae meal without breaking the bank.I arrived on a busy Friday evening, valeted my car, and checked in, waited about 20 min. (it was extremely busy actually). The pianist was playing fantastically! As soon as we were seated, our waitress introduced herself, offered us some wine, and brought over a breadstick and sourdough basket, along with a dish filled with pickles, peppers, and veggies atop a bed of ice, so each piece was chilled and delish!The DINE LA promo is great, because you get a 3 course meal: appetizer, main dish, and dessert for about $34.  Sooo...For my appetizer I ordered the AHI SASHIMI ON TOAST with remoulade, capers, onions, and feta cheese  This was divine! I wish i had more than the 3 pieces they served. The tuna was raw (obviously) and had so much flavor, particularly with the capers and feta. Yum.As I enjoyed my appetizer, I could hear the female pianist singing Benny and the Jets so I began to hum along as I crunched on my toast. The table next to me starting singing along, because the pianist's performance was so terrific we all couldn't help it! I had a blast!For my main course, I had the PEPPERED PETIT FILET MIGNON, medium, which came with the creamiest garlic mashed potatoes I'd ever had (you can choose from mashed potatoes, baked potato, or rice). The piece of filet mignon was indeed petit but the side dishes were generously portioned. The filet mignon had a topping of chopped onion, pepper, and other flavorful ingredients that I couldn't quite make out but definitely no need for steak sauce! The meat was tender and flavorful in every bite.There was also a side of the most delectable green beans, they were sauteed in some type of sauce that presented a bit of a nutty taste, which was amazing! The green beans were a little crunchy and so flavorful.For dessert I had the GOLD BRICK SUNDAE served on a lace cookie. This is not your average sundae from Baskin Robbin. This was a giant baseball sized scoop of vanilla bean ice cream atop a delicate lace confection, covered in a rich, decadent fudge that hardened. Wowee wow! This was soo tasty!All in all, the service was EXCELLENT and the food was even better. I highly recommend Dal Rae for the old money feel and poppy pianist. Very classy place so dress appropriately.Enjoy!",0
2885,6515,"Some of the greatest foods I have had. I recommend the crab legs myself, but the prime rib is grest also. They have a pepper steak that I believe is there signature dish that is awesome.  And then don't forget dessert the bananas foster made right at your table wow.",0
2886,6516,Love this place!! The food was great and the service was exceptional. Someone was always checking on us making sure our beverages were full and our food was out quick. Rob the waiter did a great job give him a raise!,0
2887,6517,"Wow wonderful food, fantastic service.  Had the Chilean sea bass, was incredible. This place is my new favorite.",0
2888,6518,"Reading some of the negative yelps posted here compelled me to jump in and provide a little of my own special input.First, as to the complaints over slow service:  it's not slow to the servers, it's just about right. If you want something faster, go next door to Sizzler; they'll get you in and out quickly enough to catch BOTH Law and Order reruns.  Remember that some of these gals have been here since Ford was making cars across the street and Kenna Liquor was run by Dale and Emmett's Mom and not some former bamboo farmer from Damyang.OK, what to order:  Get yourself a shrimp cocktail, a  pepper steak (the new York, not the fillet) rare, and a salad.  They do fresh fish very well too, just be sure and tell them how you like it.   You won't be disappointed, ever.  If you want something exotic, you've come to the wrong place.  (You're looking for that fusion joint about three miles due north where they braise a mean geoduck.)  Save some room for a dessert too, something your Grandmother would have ordered, preferably something heavy and brown topped with whipped cream.The parking:  OK, I have found the key to having my expectations met by parking valets is directly related to how well I let them know what I want up front.  At Dal Rae,  simply telling the attendant, ""don't kick the shotgun under the seat, the safety is broken"", is usually more than enough to get both careful and properly subservient service.  Your mileage may vary.The small stuff:  Too much/too little goo on your salad, etc.  Tell, 'em, up front and fast what you want fixed, these guys will hop to.  Wait and snivel among yourselves about some petty slight until the next course is served and you'll just make yourself unhappy.  Speak UP!  Be a man.  Or,  be a woman, whatever works.  I've had my share of miscues among the many meals I eaten there over the years, but they have never failed to make it right.  Lessee, what else . . . the ""Horse thing"", Sir Dale Rae was a horse, a trotter more precisely, that's why they have all the racing stuff.  Prices: plan to spend at least $50 to $70 per adult, more if you drink; (by the by, some of the wine prices are marked up ferociously, caveat emptor.  Noisy?  If you are still dining when the Piano Bar gets rolling, you may find it a bit off-putting.  Those prone to such aural sensitivity need to arrive earlier and be on their way before the old drunks start getting down.Enjoy.",0

2892,6522,"""WOW!"" was the first thing I uttered as I savored the Pepper Steak Filet Mignon and Prime Rib.  The meat was so tender and juicy, and the Au Jus, green bean almondine and baked potato were perfect accompaniments.  The crudite platter was a nice touch.  I love finding old school steakhouses and this place is by far one of the best in LA.",0
2893,6523,"The Dal Rae is by far one of my favorite restaurants in zee world. I've enjoyed every plate that I've sampled from my fellow diners but my usual is TOPS!  appetizer: crab stuffed artichokes, I drown them with lemon, they are so delectable, they just melt in mah mouth...and I love the little fork they're served with!lobster thermidor: one of my favorite dishes, not just here, but frickin anywhere. Here just happens to be where they make it best.dessert:bananas flambe. bananas foster is another name I've heard this ridiculously decadent dessert called. whatever you want to call it, something this good should be illegal. I would risk the punishment.ambience: yes, I do almost expect to be seated next to some goodfellas. quite alright with meh, just shows goodfellas too have good taste in food.The only negative thing I have to say about this place is the valet service. I am not cheap and have been known to pay for valet even at places where you have the choice (when I'm running late, or don't feel like spot searching/walking). Here, you not only don't have the choice, but the lot is not large enough to warrant it. Add to that on one occasion, we realized we didn't have the cash to pay them (like most, we pay everything with card) and we were rudely unbelievably (gasp!) told of where to find an ATM! Ultimately, we spoke to a manager and got the problem worked out but not before our visit was tarnished by the valet. One star is deducted purely for the valet.",0
2894,6524,"I love, love, love this restaurant. You feel like you're walking back into the rat pack days with Davis and Sinatra, but the service is impeccable and the food is outstanding!

Never a wait here, I highly recommend Dal Rae in Pico Rivera.",0
2897,6527,"My wife and I went there this past Saturday evening for her birthday. The experience was great. We didn't know what to expect when we got there since the outside of the place is somewhat ""hole in the wall"" but I had heard good things so we gave it a shot. Walking in, you immediatley understand that the inside is the complete polar opposite of the outside. Very classy place.Our food was excellent to say the least! I asked the waitress (Stacy - highly recommend that you request her - youngest waitress there, sweet, and great service) what the signature dish was and she suggested the Peppered Steak (filet minon).  It had to be one of the best steaks I have ever eaten!My wife and I were thoroughly pleased. We've eaten at other higher priced restaurants and this place blows them all away.Its is a hidden gem that you should not pass up. You will not be dissapointed. And for me its only minutes away - what luck!Thanks Dal Rae for an unforgettable experience.",0
2898,6528,"NO MORE LAWRY'S FOR PRIME RIB!!I have to give Dal Rae 5 stars like most of the reviewers below.Dal Rae kicks butt over Lawry's in terms of VALUE! Example: The Lawry's Cut is $39, Dal Rae's equivalent Petite Cut is $32.95; the Lawry's Diamond Jim Brady Cut is $49, Dal Rae's equivalent Regular Cut is $37.95--you do the math. The prime rib was buttery and tender--just as good if not better than Lawry's.My wife's boss was visiting from overseas. Whenever he is in L. A., he makes it a point to visit Lawry's--until now. The first words out of his mouth when his Regular Cut prime rib plate was placed in front of him was, ""This is the Regular Cut?!"" His eyes and mouth were wide open in awe. He could not believe the portion. After taking his first bite, he said it was very tender and flavorful.I settled for their Petite Filet (10 oz.) Pepper Steak and luckily I did; because, my wife plopped half of her Petite Cut prime rib on my plate. I ordered the filet medium rare--like ALL steaks should be eaten. My filet was tender and very tasty, but a touch over cooked. I like to see some blood oozing onto my plate. I don't know why I wasted my money dining at Claim Jumper's three nights earlier.At Claim Jumper's, I ordered their filet mignon (7 oz.) at $25. The steak was tender but it's texture was more like mashed potato when I ate it; the flavor did not compare to Dal Rae's filet. I guess the old adage, ""You get what you pay for"" definitely applies in this case. Claim Jumper's is absolutely out of Dal Rae's league.Del Rae's service was also good. Our waitress was very attentive. My iced tea was refilled without me asking.The first time I dined at Del Rae was about 20 years ago; but I only have a vague memory of the food. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place over Lawry's anytime. It's more convenient, it has a larger list of dishes to choose from, and it's a better value. When driving to Lawry's, I always dread driving up La Cienega from the I-10 freeway. It is always congested and you always have these reckless yahoos speeding by everyone in a hurry to go nowhere.",0
2899,6529,"I highly recommend that peppered steak, very tasty and satisfying. Everything here is so good for the price that you pay. Another thing, the drinks are well poured (if you know what I mean). Always a plus.",1

2904,6534,"Love this place! Haven't been in awhile and decided to go on our wedding anniversary last week. Lydia was our server and she was top notch. Always smiling and just so pleasant. Exceptional service all around. I had the prime rib special of the day and it was so delicious. It came with their extra creamy mashed potatoes and asparagus. The meat itself was a generous portion, all for $22. Oh, and since it was Friday, don't forget the clam chowder. My husband had the dinner portion lobster thermidore, also mashed pots and asparagus. He said it was a great meal. Because it was our anniversary, they brought us a piece of chocolate mousse cake. So rich and good. A gentleman (owner or manager?) was going around to the tables and asking how the meals were and greeting everyone. This place is first class all the way from the time you are seated until you walk out the door. It is a real dining experience and there aren't many around like this anymore. Great food, service, and atmosphere places Dal Rae at the top. Next time I'll save room for the cherries jubilee.",0
2905,6535,"Greatest place for steak! I was shocked about the exterior design of the restaurant, but when I walked inside it was really nice! I came here with my dad, his co-workers & family, & boss & his family. It was a really great dinner. The service was nice, but they forgot to bring a couple of stuff to the others at the table. The appetizers were really delicious! And my entree was great. It was a large cut fillet mignon & it was the best piece of meat I've ever tasted. The prices are outrageous tho. Id come back if I had the money, but I plan on keep this place in mind when it comes to huge celebrations.",0
2906,6536,Great food! Great drinks! great company! It's always a joy at DEL RAES ! Steak and potatoes always cooked right!,1
2907,6537,"Unfortunately after hearing good things about Dal Rae I was hoping it would meet all the hype. This happens too many times to establishments that believe they have made a lasting impression on the public. Sadly the misconception is in the restaurant business you need to ALWAYS bring your ""A"" game. Just like me there are many new clients to win over and Dal Rae fell beyond short. They would get a 1 and a half star if that were possible. Those stars would directly go to the waiters that kept our water glasses full and got our orders right. Sadly food quality and preparation was below average. It's great that Dal Rae would like to keep the old tradition of making a classic tableside cesear salad, but here's a suggestion. Eat at some restaurants that prepare it with finesse, like BOA in Santa Monica.  Your patrons like their dressing on their salad and not on their chairs and clothes. The person preparing the tableside service was a bit sloppy. So as we were about to leave, my friend's father who was seated slightly to the left of the mixing cart had a new design on the back of his shirt... all made with cesaer dressing. The seat he was seated on also got a nice serving of dressing. Another thought, make your menu limited. People love variety but they like quality when you're charhing the price for it. We ordered Oysters Rockafella as well as oysters on a half shell.  We originally only ordered the Oysters Rockafella, but went ahead and ordered the oysters on a half shell so we could actually taste oysters. To our disappointment the oysters on the half shell were small which explained the lack in taste of oysters in the Oysters Rockafella. Clue to the chef, the main ingredient is Oysters, hence the name Oysters Rockafella. If you can't get the owner to buy  quality oysters, then don't put it on the menu and charge $18.00 for it. Also, if you're going to offer oysters on the half shell, train the people shucking the oysters that they need to release the oyster from the abuctor muscle otherwise forget trying to do that with your butter knife. It's just a lost cause after that.  After the salad and appetizers arrived, our party of 8 nearly passed out from waiting for our entrees. When the food arrived as far as those seated near us here's what NOT to order. Pasta with meat sauce, pasta was over cooked and sauce was bland. Prime rib, tasteless. Fillet mignon was asked to be medium NOT medium well. The peoper sauce on the fillet mignon, great peppery flavor if i were to season 12 fillet mignon. Pepper sauce is supposed to taste peppery, but not taste as if you dumped an entire container of pepper into a sauce. The free range chicken with wild mushrooms....When i read ""with wild mushrooms"" my thoughts are is it is an accompaniment to the chicken, in the least maybe a ragu of Chantarelles, Morels and maybe some Portobello ... instead i got a few slivers of what I believe was a baby Portobellos in a brown sauce. BUT I can understand since the chicken was indeed in need of sauce. I was also given a side of what i believe was rice pilaf. Either the rice pilaf was old or cold or undercooked, the bottom line is rice cooked well doesn't have a hard stick to your teeth hardness to it when you're eating. So in the end, not meeting the hype and friends who took me there said this was their worse experience there won't be making another visit. Maybe it was a bad night in staffing and or other circumstances, but these are problems any well established restaurant has to face. Put a little money back into investing in your biggest assets  (the chefs and staff in your kitchen). CONSISTENCY in food quality and in food service is paradigm in keeping old customers coming back and making a good impression on new ones. For me and one other new potential customer, our thoughts echoed, ""First and LAST time at Dal Rae"".",0
2908,6538,"Excellent food, every dish around the table was sampled and each were highly enjoyable. Great ambiance, loved the live entertainment and overall great place for a special occasion. I had never been to this restaurant and had no clue it existed. Overall enjoyable experience.",1
2909,6539,"The last time I was here, there was a couple in their 60's fully making out in one of the booths.  I was going to shout ""get a room!"" but hey, if I were 60 and still gettin' some I would be pretty damn happy.I don't usually find myself in this neck of the woods, but the Dal Rae is that kind of cool/old school/crisp white tablecloth steakhouses that is worth making the drive out for on a special occasion, especially during the holidays when they deck out the restaurant interior with thousands of white twinkly lights.Most of the patrons look like they have been coming here since the 50's, but it's a cool authentic retro vibe, and the food really is delicious.",1
2910,6540,Ok just got back from this place went here with the wife for our anniversary. OK so they have a holiday menu now so it is not the full menu as they show online. I got the Pepper steak filet which was 37 bucks 2 jack and coke which was 9.45 each and my wife got the chilean Sea Bass cooked (al a ben) which was 32.50 and she liked it we had the veggi's while we waited and the garlic bread you have to ask for it and that was very good. Over all it was good to me a little over priced but i am use to going to sizzler for steak.,1
2911,6541,"My family and I have been coming to this restaurant for years and it's never changed! We always come here for special occasions like Mother's Day, Birthdays, etc. and the food and service is excellent! Its truly a hidden gem in Pico Rivera. you'd never guess!I recommend the chilean sea bass, any of their steaks, and crab stuffed mushrooms! Cesaer's salad is prepared fresh and table side, the cherries jubilee and bananas flambee are to die for, also prepared tableside!Its such a change to step back into time and experience the dining experience like it used to be. Get dressed up and have a long relaxing meal! Highly recommend this place for families, couples, and celebrations!",0
2912,6542,"Update: a more recent visit to this exclusive restaurant has won my heart.The famous pepper steak was as tender as ever, and the Lobster Thermidor was unforgettably creamy and rich with flavors I would die for. One of the escargot was an empty shell, and they gladly served more as an apology.The friendly owner came out and greeted me by name after the staff brought out a creme cake with a lit candle. They surprised my date on her birthday. All I did was send the Maitre D' a note a day prior to dinner. Thanks Dal Rae for a magical night!",0
2913,6543,"This is where you burn lots of money. And perhaps with just cause.You pull into a parking lot full of luxury automobiles: Rolls Royce, Mercedes and the likes. Valet takes your car as you walk into a building that appears like a casual 50's diner with an old neon sign illuminating above. This is a place located in a typical suburban city of Pico Rivera.Once inside, you're suddenly transported to Beverly Hills. You find yourself surrounded by well-to-do clients and people of high society. I felt under-dressed and had somehow snuck into the millionaire's country club. Nevertheless, I was treated like royalty by superb and attentive staff.The menu is quite expansive (and expensive); there are more than 10 different kinds of salads alone. I don't know any other place that serves caviar, escargot and lobster thermidor all under one roof. You'll see some items of the 1950's era such as Steak Diana and Cherry Jubilee (they set this on fire to give you and your date an impressive table-side performance).While my order of Chicken Caesar salad and sliced filet mignon was prepared, they served fresh vegetables on ice, which includes carrots and celery. I'm assuming vegetables on ice were common of the 50's.The salad was unusually chopped fine. Must be a 50's thing? The fork was chilled, giving the impression they are careful with the minutest details. The steak pieces were succulent and delicious but small in portions for the price I paid.Some vintage jazz music sets a mood in this classic fancy restaurant, and the interior decor is rich in dark mahogany woods and booth seating is supple with soft leather.I don't know why the price range is labeled as ""$$$""; it seems more like ""$$$$"" considering the most expensive entree is $95, desserts typically go for $17, and some wine bottles $300 (like a Dom Perignon or Cristal). Valet isn't free either.I recommend this place for special occasions only, if you crave gourmet food, or if you're just plain rich.",0
2914,6544,Fantastic atmosphere reminiscent of the 50's. Start off with House Relish Tray and Bread Basket to start you on your trip to Heaven. Cesar Salad made at the table from scratch.   Filet Mignon and Prime Rib cooked to perfection.  Creamed Corn was incredibly mouth watering delish.   Desert was to die for!,0
2915,6545,"From the moment we walked in to the time we walked out - wow, what a fabulous experience.Right away we were drawn to the ""old school"" look and feel of the restaurant and lounge.  We started off in the bar with a pre-dinner cocktail and our martinis were served full in large glasses at the perfect temperature.Dinner was nothing short of perfection.  We started off with the escargot, shared a chopped salad (I heard their chopped salad was awesome and it didn't disappoint) and had prime rib.  We ordered a bottle of wine and I can't ell you what was better...the food or service.Ended the meal with a complimentary birthday chocolate cake. I wish I remembered our server's name as she was fantastic!The only downfall is we have to drive about 30 minutes to get here.  Next time we will call a cab.",0
2916,6546,"It was our (party of 6) first time...and last time here! We had such high hopes for this place because we had heard good things about it.  Sadly,  we were all left deeply disappointed.  First, the place was extremely crowded. I have never seen these many tables in one room. Not sure if management felt it was a quick way to make a buck (but definitely an unexpected move for such a ""reputable and classy"" restaurant).  The dinning tables were so close that people were getting trapped trying to make their way to the restroom.  Dining guest literally had to get up from their seats to make room for someone to walk by.  Things got so bad, that my girlfriend got a pretty nasty elbow to the back of her head by the waiter trying to squeeze by, AND to top it off, only got a measly apology.Next we had the Caesar salad which was prepared tableside in this already overcrowded space.  After I was done with Salad, the salad preparer (man in a 3 piece suit) asked if I enjoyed it, I explained why I didn't and he said ""sorry that you didn't enjoy it"". In my opinion, don't ask unless you are prepared to do something about it.To make a long story short, my girlfriend's rib eye steak was burnt, our friends' steaks were bland,and my filet mignon was good but, because of the overall experience, we will not be returning.",0
2917,6547,"We had high hopes given other reviews. We were hoping this would be a new favorite/ regular place for us - but it was a disaster from the start. We had an 8:00 reservation, but wasn't seated until 8:30. That is ok, availability is dependent upon patrons generally- but after we were seated and it took 10 minutes to see our waiter, we suspected something was up. The waiter came and took our drink order, and we also ordered the artichoke crab appetizer. 10 minutes later, the waiter returns with our drinks (he didn't know what a dark and stormy was, I had to explain it, and what he brought had light rum not spiced dark rum and was $14),  and told us the specials and asked if we wanted to order an appetizer. Another red flag. We reminded him we ordered the appetizer when we ordered drinks. He hadn't put it in. He apologized and went and put it in. We didn't see our waiter again for 15 minutes (dinner order not yet taken) and he asks what we want for our main dish. We order, including a side. 10 more minutes pass and the appetizer arrives (finally) and the dish is mediocre and not overly hot given it must have sat a while. 25 more minutes pass, and our meals arrive - minus the side we ordered. After putting our dishes down he asks if he can do anything else. I ask about the side, which he obviously forgot, and he says it was up and he would go get it (note a small side of mushrooms and his tray was 45% empty). Out of frustration at the poor service my wife cancelled the side, the waiter was confused and kept pushing that he will bring it, and she insisted that he cancel it. He goes away, comes back with the mushrooms muttering (I'm not kidding) that he doesn't want them to go to waste and he will take it off the bill. All of that for mushrooms that were unremarkable at best. We never saw the waiter again - another waiter in the area was available for getting us boxes and eventually the bill. The steak was good, the mashed potatoes were good, everything else - including the cold bread and frozen slab of butter, was not good. We really go with the flow generally and are patient with a slow kitchen if the food is good and the service competent. This place was just a total fail - and a huge disappointment given it seemed to have potential.",1
2918,6548,The food was phenomenal. Service was excellent. The round booths however were a little uncomfortable to sit in with four people. Overall a really good experience. The manager was very nice and cordial. He took great care of us.,0
2919,6549,"After years of missing the Dal Rae in Fullerton, CA., we found Dal Rae in Pico Rivera, and it is just as fine as ever!  My husband took me there tonight for our 35th wedding anniversary.  Our server, Mary Jane, made our night extra special.  The food was delicious and plentiful. Mary Jane was friendly, attentive, and genuinely interested in our special day.The shrimp scampi was perfect, my husband had the peppered steak and it was delicious!  Of course, we had to have the brie and garlic, and the Cesare salad.  If you have tried Dal Rae, please go, you will pleased with all they have to offer.  Next time we are having the Sea Bass.A great anniversary with my best friend, and a wonderful dinner at Dal Rae!",1
2920,6550,"Came here in February of 2013 to celebrate my mom and great uncle's birthday. I'm going to go ahead and put this out first - it is EXPENSIVE. There was a group of 12 of us, and although I never saw the bill because my great aunts were footing it, I overheard them splitting it in half and my goodness. This is not the place I would come as a poor college student and newlywed, trust me. That aside, if I had some money to burn I'd definitely come this way.The dining area is kind of dark and a little bit small, but I kind of liked that old steakhouse feel. I would probably recommend it for a more intimate setting, rather than for large groups, but the staff was great and made it work.The group ordered escargot - although I'm not the biggest fan of the dish, I tried it. It wasn't the best I'd had, but it was pretty good. My husband had the mahi mahi and I had the filet mingon medallions. To this day, we still talk about how that was absolutely the best meal we'd had. Just cooked so right and flavorful. We also had the Grand Mariner desert - a sort of raspberry chocolate icecream. It was amazing.Like I said, if I could truly afford it, I would come back here again and again!",0
2921,6551,"12/1/17 - Been talking about taking my kids to this place for dinner since they do enjoy a nice restaurant. Told them about the Del Rae Caesar Salad experience with them making the dressing and prepping the salad in front of you. We have a reservation at 9, we show up at 8:50. We don't get our table until 9:35. We are seated and then close to 10pm we finally meet our waitress who looks like she is on the verge of a meltdown. She is talking to us but her eyes are wondering the Restaurant which was super rude. They bring water to the table and offer no additional drinks. Our bread then comes to the table, I ask for Oil/Vinegar for the bread, that ends up coming almost 20min later. It's now getting late and our waitress never came back to get our order. She finally returns and takes our order almost a full hour after we were seated.... I order the Del Rae Caesar in the hopes that my kids will get to see Kent whip us up an amazing salad. Unfortunately, because of how jammed pack they booked the restaurant, the salad ends up coming from the back of the kitchen just like any other basic restaurant. My kids were really disappointed about the horrible service, and to not get the one thing they were looking forward to, the visuals of seeing the salad be made at the edge of the table. My bill for 2 adults and 2 children was $200 with tip. This has to be one of the most expensive meals I have had with such horrible service. I have written this restaurant off now. My wife and I have been here now 4 times and I must say the place has gradually gotten worse each visit. Our First experience was a dream, it was all downhill after that visit though.",0
2922,6552,"Please read the full review.The food was great, the service even better. The restaurant was immaculate, no complaints there, it was after I left when all the issues happened.We at on Sunday, a party of 4. When we received the bill, the two men split the amounts. The bill being $200+. My friend paid $100 +Tip in cash and I did the same on my Credit card which was charged as a debit. No issues there.On Monday as I review my banking statement I noticed that the restaurant charged my card twice..... (1) for the full $200+ amount and then a (2) for my half of the bill.I called the restaurant and wasn't able to get a hold of the book keeper on Monday, was told to call back the next day in the morning.Its now Tuesday, same thing happened, was told to call back.It's now Wed morning, I spoke with the bookkeeper and was told ""I don't know why this happens but it happens often. Just don't pay with a debit card, pay cash or Credit next time. The charge will just drop off""Well, it hasn't and now I am out over $300+ because of a poorly designed payment system.If you eat here, please bring cash. Horrible experience.",0
2923,6553,"Dal Rae has always been one of my favorites as long as I remember. My family has had a long history with this restaurant so maybe I'm a little biased. Yes, at times the service can be long due to the crowds but I never have been disappointed with the quality of their food. For the area it is definitely the best place to go to enjoy good food, good company or entertain clients. The steaks and fish dishes are very good and I was always impressed with their salads as we'll. I highly recommend!",0
2924,6554,"Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, but this place is just not for me.Went here for lunch to celebrate a co-workers birthday.  Atmosphere made the place look like a place that is primarily for business people.  Business lunches or dinners.  I didn't really know much about this place, just tagged along with the co-workers for this one.Maybe I should have ordered something different, but my plate wasn't anything to brag about.  The vegetables were strings of beans that I could have gotten the same consistency if I bought frozen veggies from the grocery store and microwaved it.  On the upside, the chicken was ok, moist, and the sauce was good as well.  Came with a sprinkling of mushrooms also covered in the same sauce.  The dish also came with mash potatoes which were actually the consistency that I like mash potatoes.  Not smooth and creamy, but chunky, with bits of potatoes that haven't been mashed yet.  But then again, as I said before, it was nothing really to brag about.From what my co-workers who ordered their sandwiches told me, their sandwiches were a bit dry.  But I guess that's secondary opinion, so don't take my word on it.",1
2925,6555,"Okay, I get it.  It's retro.  It saves endangered species of American cuisine and decor (and from what I hear, the art of the martini).  But guess what: some things really SHOULD go out of style.  For example: taking a lovely filet of fish, coating it in parmesan, cooking it perfectly, and then drowning it in butter sauce.  After the first bite, I quickly moved it out of the butter to dryer ground, removed the parmesan coating, and proceeded to enjoy it.The vegetables were clearly there to look at, not eat; they were undercooked.The salad was quite good (candied walnuts and blue cheese will tend to make anything good).The service was slow, but remedied quickly enough after it was discovered we'd been waiting for some time.  I lost my knife somewhere after salad.Tiramisu was nice but a little too sweet.So I guess it is a modern marvel of culinary style to prepare quality food in such a way as to make it taste like itself.  I mean, I like fish.  I think it is tasty in its own right.  It doesn't need all the butter and cheese.So while I approve of preserving food culture (no, really, I do), I just didn't happen to like this style of food.  Perhaps I shall return someday (when it's not a work lunch) for a martini or three.",0
2926,6556,"This place reminds me of a restaurant in Goodfellas where all the mob gangsters would hang out and eat their dinners with their chinchilla coats hanging off the back of their chair. While the customers didn't resemble mobsters of sorts, the service staff totally did. The piano bar, the high back leather booths and low light ambiance.Okay enough of the room, onto the food. We tried the ribeye and the chicken with wild mushrooms. While both were delectable food, I mean the ribeye is HUGE and the chicken was nice and tasty, the service was horrendous. Our food took FOREVER to come out. It seemed since we are ""young"" our waitress could care less about us. Or maybe it was because we came with our little one that she shrugged us off. Service to me can make or break an experience and unfortunately it made the experience lackluster. To go along with the service our table was squeezed up against another, and I had to shimmy myself out of my chair just to make it to the bathroom. Food was good, the service lacked and the noise level was off the charts. If you come here, wear a fur coat, they might treat you better.",0

This place aint cheap.  You bring some here its not going to be a cheap date.For the food. we ordered crab cakes, shrimp cocktails and open shell oysters.  Cocktails was very good. The oysters were very, very good.  The crab cakes, i wanted to kill someone over.   my god it was sooooooooo D***N good.  I dont care what you order you have to start with the crab cakes. wow. i had the chileian sea bass. It was good but not as good as my wifes pepper   beff skirt steak. The service was amazing.  None of had noooo complaints.  We had the pleasure of being taken care of by Mary Jane.  Wonderful lady with great customer service skills.

2932,6562,"I thought about going here on New Years Day, but they were closed.  To no avail, OpenTable allowed me to  make a reso for the following night, Saturday night.  Asked for a booth, and got the one right between the kitchen entrance and the passage to the bathroom...with a reservation. Fortunately, I'm not shy and asked to be moved promptly.  Glad I did, as they sat the surrounding booths within five minutes.I've dined here a couple of times before, so as everyone seems to know, be prepared to pay appropriately for the service.  The food was excellent, as it should be at the price.  Sorry to Cassie and Sandra with the NYE ""plunder"" for the $20 bucks a head.  I agree you should have been told when making your reservations.  (I've been burned at other places like this, and I avoid places on ""special occasion"" days unless I book the reservation in person.We ordered a couple of cocktails and the tableside caesar salad (prepared by the maitre'd).  Ask for the cheesy garlic bread (can't remember the Yelper who mentioned it in their review, but it was definitely worth mentioning).  Chilean Sea Bass ""a la Ben"" was spectacular, moist and juicy.  Pepper Steak (a House specialty) was good, but I should have followed my gut instinct and ordered something different.  All in all, a good dining experience, and definitely a great place to go if you're trying to meet equidistantly between LA and OC.

GOOD! Actual chunks of crab cake. The only other place that had BIGGER chunks of crab was at The Cannery in Newport Beach. But it was still super good!the Filet Mignon was delicious too. It was cooked correctly and the sauce was nice. Although the sauce could be a bit stronger. I'm not one to use A1 sauce so the sauce.. stronger yes.Creme brulee was goood! =)Overall it was an excellent dining experience and I could came back again, even when it's not restaurant week. =PAlthough I probably would go when I went back home home cause then it's a much closer drive. hehes.",0

I had ordered a water no ice and when I drank it all they never refilled it for me. Finally our starter salad came. Very small but it was only a starter. Someone passing asked if I wanted more water so they refilled it and took our salad places away. We waited a while for our food. The whole time from beginning to end our server went to our table about 4xs. I feel as if the service was bad because of how young we looked. As a former sever myself, I know how you judge a table and what tip you might get. The food was amazing, however I will never come back.

Definitely worth the drive from OC.",0

We had TWO servers, meaning we had awesome service.

It was cooked perfectly and literally melted in your mouth.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT!!The filet mignon was pretty good, it was a bit on the mushy side, but still very flavorful.And the ribeye steak was to die for.  This thing was HUGE.

His grandparents have been coming here since it opened so they had all of the best recommendations.Ambiance: Cute place. An old school feel but very hip to the times. GREAT live singer as well.Service: Incredible. We loved our server. She was spunky, attentive, and very sweet. We never went without a drink or service for that matter. And I would like to note that we came at the busiest time, so I was REALLY impressed with her.Drinks: Strong and well made. I recommend the lemon drop :)Food: Delicious. We had the Oysters Rockefeller to start and I was incredibly skeptical as I have never tried oysters, but was pleasantly surprised by how great these were.I had the salmon for dinner with the lemon butter sauce and it was amazing. I wish it was socially acceptable to ask for extra sauce and drink it because that's what I wanted to do!Overall: I highly recommend this Restaurant for a nice date night. It can either be reasonably priced or expensive, pending on what you order, making it very versatile for budget types.",0
2941,6571,"I must disagree with the reviewer who said this is the best steakhouse in LA.  It's not.  It is one of the pricier steakhouses though.  Since I love rib-eye so much, I ordered that instead of the pepper filet mignon.  I did, however, get a taste of the pepper filet and it was good.  It had a great peppery flavor (duh!) and was very tender.  If I were to go back, I would definitely order that.However, the (bone-in) rib eye disappointed.  When ordering the rib-eye, you can get it charbroiled or blackened (I chose charbroiled).They put fried onion strings right on top of the rib eye and I believe there is a reason for that.  The rib-eye, although tender in most parts, was bland (cue the onion strings).  Ugh.  Comparing the prices of this rib-eye w/ those of Ruth's Chris, Fleming's or Smitty's Grill, it just isn't worth it.I must commend them on their garlic mashed potatoes.  It was very creamy and delicious.",0
2942,6572,"Took my friend here for his birthday.We both ordered the filet and what can I say...one of the best pieces of steak I've ever had.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Asparagus on the side was delicious.Some affordable, good wines on the menu as well",0
2943,6573,"Old World good. When I first saw the restaurant, parked in front were Rolls Royce's. When I finally ate here, this was fine dining in Pico Rivera?  No matter,  great cholesterol clogging food of yesteryear, exceptional drinks.",1
2944,6574,"FOOD: Average tasting, but put on plate to look fancy.SERVICE: Two times there, one server good, one server only so-so.PARKING: Valet Parking only. If you go, be careful, they park the cars close together - so you might get a ding in your door.RESERVATIONS: They take them, but it seems reservations mean very little - we still waited 25 minutes.WE WILL NOT RETURN",0
2945,6575,Wow! Wow! Wow! What a great night...Hubby had been raving about their Chilean Seabass so I ordered their Surf and Turf.  It came with a small filet and the Seabass was their own recipe called Alla Ben and it has Parmesan and onions - best fish ever and the filet was out of sight! See Mary Jane when you dine there she was amazing!,0
2946,6576,So the reason I give this place a 1 star is because after we had our dinner served to us a man came and told us not to give him a bad rating on yelp because he had a customer that had ordered his favorite drink but they made it differently at this restaurant so I said sure he said this to us because he saw us taking pictures of the food don't get me wrong the food was great and it was my friends little sisters birthday we brought our own cake to the restaurant which we shared with our 2 servers and the man who asked us not to give a bad rating but I mean it's a birthday dinner we brought our own cake and they charged us on the bill for a cake cutting fee which came out to $16 hmmm and the funny thing is one of the servers came out to the parking lot saying that he charged us for every slice they made they made 6 for our whole table and take into consideration we gave 3 slices away to them way to ruin a birthday dinner! I would recommend you not to go on your birthday because if you have a big cake and a big party you'll be charged a service fee for the restaurant cutting your cake. By the way they didn't tell us anything about the fee before hand or after until we left a note on the check 1 Star...,0
2947,6577,100% Class + Fine Dining + Outstanding staff.And the ambience?  You feel like Frank Sinatra might pop over to your table to say hello.  Outstanding!,1
2948,6578,"This is one of the best restaurants I have been to. The food is perfect! It is expensive; food for two will be over $100 for sure. I come here for special occasions. Origionally I was brought for Valentine's day, but we stopped coming for this holiday because they condense the menu into a few selections and it is more expensive. Overall, the restaurant has excellent customer service and excellent food.The fried calamari and stuffed crab mushrooms are great appetizers!",0
2949,6579,The food was excellent and the service was even better. I ordered the large filet mignon peppered steak. The steak was cooked perfect. I highly recommend this restaurant.,0
2950,6580,"I've eaten at this spots several times. Before today 4 stars. 1 neg is the prices are high, but before today, food was great. I had the fillet mignon, very blan. Very small portion. I had to use a lot of pepper and a pepper sauce to add flavor. I was bummed. The mash potatoes were good. This place is always packed during the holidays, should have went to chilis for a good ribeye.",0
2951,6581,"Whenever we have a birthday or important event in the family, this is the spot. Nice fancy place with gourmet food. You pay a lot, but get what you pay for. Keep up the good work Dal Rae.",1
2952,6582,I've been here many times.  I really like the place.  the service is wonderful and the food is awesome.  The only reason i'm not 5 starring it is because the steaks aren't cooked how you ask.  Maybe they know its an issue because the menu even states that they cant guarantee the cooking of the steak as requested.  I was there last night with my family and like always the service was great.  I ordered my steak Medium + and got a medium rare steak.  other than that.  great place.,0
2953,6583,"I've had oysters rockerfeller many times before but, this place has the BEST! Their scallops are extremely good as well. The peppercorn new york steak was really good too, I've had better but it was honestly good. Overall though, it is a 5 star restaurant.",0
2954,6584,I have been to the Dal Rae a couple of times now and this place is amazing! Food is stupidly good. Service is friendly and prompt.I had a Martini for the first time at this place and they were strong and delicious.I had the pepper steak that was great!  The Swordfish was even better than the steak!Kind of pricey but well worth the extra bucks. Cool interior decorations and the exterior looks like an old motel.This place is definitely a place to go at least once in your life.,1
2955,6585,"I'm surprised with soo many five stars.  I guess retro sells.So, I figured it out. Dal Rey is traditional American not new American.  There holds a big difference between these two.They had a rib eye special a few nights ago, so we came to his favorite restaurant.  I'm not a fan of this place.  For starters, the ahi tuna appetizer was the WORST I ever had.  I couldn't even eat it.  It was just plain yuck. The tuna was too mushy and soft...I can't attempt to try and say anything good about it.His rib eye was way too pink and bloody.  Making me want to vomit as I write this just thinking about it.  And when I ordered halibut, they asked me how I wanted it cooked and offered it could be cooked in like seriously, eight or nine different ways, which gave me a feeling that the cooks don't prepare or perfect their dishes.  Usually when you go to a new American restaurant, they prepare the food for you and it tastes delicious.  Dal Rae isn't hip to this factor. In other words, if you tell them how you want it cooked and it doesn't taste good, then it's not their fault, it's your fault because you ordered it that way.The vegetables in the vegetable basket looked wilted.  I didn't even want to eat them.  And the fried pita bread threw me off.  Why not serve hummus with pita bread??? Instead, they only offered butter.My last complaint.  The check was far beyond a price JP and I usually pay for.  In fact, it was like 70 dollars over priced.  JP and his family and people live by this place.  I hate to say it, but I don't know what the hype is all about.  I guess if you live in Whittier, it would be the cool place to eat, but I'm from LA and I've experienced far better.",0
2956,6586,I came here for lunch the other day and I enjoyed it very much.The fancy yet romantic atmosphere was cute and I would say perfect for dates. Service was excellent from the beginning to end.Now for the food....- the butter here is excellent! I wanted to eat the whole stick but that would just be disgusting.- Sea bass with dill sauce was cooked perfectly. So tasty and naturally greasy!- tiramisu was very rich and delicious.I would definitely come back here!,0
2957,6587,"Old school steak house with an attentive wait staff.My family was meeting my boyfriend for the first time - eek, I know - and we decided to try out Dal Rae's for dineLA week. It was super crowded for a Wednesday evening, so I'm glad we had reservations. The valet was a tad backed up when I pulled up - I ended up waiting in the center median of the street for a little while before I was able to turn into the parking lot. Just FYI, it's valet parking only.Our server was really friendly and made a point of asking if we were celebrating a special occasion. I guess she took notice of the bouquet of flowers the boyfriend gave to my mom. (Total brownie points for him, right?) The server also was super accommodating when my older brother arrived in the middle of our meal. She said she would put in his order right away so his appetizer and entree would come out ASAP.We ordered a variety of things off the dineLA menu - a couple of standouts were the crab-stuffed mushrooms, the pepper steak, and veal. The cheese toast was a favorite of the table. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals and we had plenty of wine and beer flowing.All in all, a very delightful meal. Fortunately for all parties involved, dinner went smoothly and I think my boyfriend got the seal of approval.",0
2958,6588,"Came here for a drug presentation. There's $3.50 valet parking. All the staff was very nice. My waitress even called me ""Love""....now that's a first.*Sourdough bread- crust was a little chewy, but not really a fan of sourdough*Fried Calamari- super good. its so CRISPY and fresh*Ahi Sashimi on Toast- my first time trying something like this and it was realli good. definitely try it*Pepper Steak, Filet Mignon- a little too salty/peppery for my taste. unfortunately i was only able to bear eating half of the steak, but it was very tender*Crème Brulé- the caramelized layer was a little thicker than what im used to...it was a little too sweetLOVED the calamari and ahi sashimi on toast.I'd come here just for that that : )2 stars for each!",1
2959,6589,Love this Pico Rivera gem.  Best sea bass around. This is one of the few steakhouses where I will order the sea bass over a ribeye,0
2960,6590,"This place is super old school. Super cool.They do everything the old fashioned way. Waiters are in nice suits, jazz music playing, the whole presentation is fancy and not in a too-stuffy way.We've had good waiters here and we've had just okay waiters here.Only complaint is they tend to run out of things sometimes, they ran out of Baked Alaska once, and also have a very limited menu on special holidays, like Mother's Day, etc. We couldn't really order off the menu.This is also a good place for old men to take their escorts, so therefore the people watching is dynamite!",1
2961,6591,I am not as satisfied as would have liked for this higher class restaurant.,1
2962,6592,Some of the best food I have ever had... I recommend the surf and turf: Chilean Sea Bass with Peppercorn Steak is amazing!!!!! Definitely an upper scale restaurant with upper scale prices but it is worth it every once I  am while.,0
2963,6593,"Food is delicious, service is tolerable. Really, the food makes up for the service. I think some of the people have been working there too long and might be burned out, overworked, understaffed, or all of the above...",1
2964,6594,"Our family goes 2-3 x's a year for special occasions, some very good and some OK.  Last Sunday 5 of us went for a birthday dinner and I got to say  that we had the some of the best and friendliest service at any restaurant EVER.  Her name (on my receipt) is JJ and she was fantastic!!!!  I hope that the Dal Rae appreciates her....I am sure that customers do!",0
2965,6595,"I was sad when they updated the inside of this place. It used to have this really awesome, old school, gangster, allure to it, but not so much anymore.Anyhow I have been going here for years. The service is good and the is pretty good as well. But I would say it is a little over priced. For dinner and drinks its like 100.00 a person. Last time we went there was 9 of us and the bill was 1200.00. I would rather go to Ruth Chris or Mr. Chows if I'm going to drop that kind of cash. Buy all in all a cool place.",1
2966,6596,"Last night I came for the first time, and the food was excellent, I order the Duck il Orange, was delicious, the only inconvenience it was the male waiter who served on us, he just left us there and never came back to check on how we were doing.",0
2967,6597,I was so excited to try Del Rae.  It was good but I would not go as far as saying it was great.  Reviews are overly hyped.  If you've had good food you know what to compare.  I've had much better food for half the price.  I definitely would not return.  Definitely not worth your money.  Good customer service though.,1
2968,6598,"Another visit...another excellent meal..from appetizers to desserts, everything was great. Also extraordinary service.",0
2969,6599,"Fantastic!!  Food and Service are both outstanding . Some highlights: crab cakes , Caesar salad ( prepared table side ), Chilean Sea bass, soufflé . Actually,  everything is  amazing! Definitely worth the drive.",0
2970,6600,"If you long for a unique experience, flash back to 70's scarface meets local country club...this is worth a visit. Somewhat high end experience valet, table side food prep, exquisite waiter presentation. Similar to what would get at Vegas hotel steakhouse.Got the pepper steak was good to okay not worth the ($20 Premium), my wife got halibut much better.Wouldnt make it a regular spot but worth an occasional visit.",0
2971,6601,"Not the best food ever, but very good..  What keeps me coming back over the years is it is solid and dependable-- you can always count on good food, well prepared and excellent service.  The Five Stars really say it all.Treat yourself once in while, put on a collared shirt, some slacks, and invite someone nice to dinner here.",0
2972,6602,"I always enjoy stepping back in time when I dine at Dal Rae.  The food is always delicious and the service is excellent.  We always enjoy ordering a table side dessert - it makes for a wonderful show!  I was hesitant when I originally heard the restaurant was in Pico Rivera, but the area is really starting to clean up.",0
2973,6603,"Sorry.  Bar area very unattentive.  Dinner side great.  Bar area very disappointing, for the type of venue.",0
2974,6604,"here's what im gonna say about this joint:expensive- like a mofo!get a steak a caesar salad and some garlic bread.if you're not happy, drinks are on me!",1
2975,6605,"A group of us from work went to the Dal Rae for lunch the other day and it was amazing. We had the whole place to ourselves which was interesting. All of us had the Filet Mignon Pepper Steak. The food was incredible and I would have to say this was the best steak I have ever enjoyed. Service was amazing, well it should be since we were the only guests, it must be amazing since my boss goes there so regularly that she knows everyone by name.I did not know what to expect with the pepper steak, they were very generous with the onion and bacon topping for the steak, I left most of it behind.",1
2976,6606,"First, let me start off by describing the overall ambiance of the restaurant.  There are three main rooms with a bar located in one of the rooms.  I could imagine the Rat Pack (Sinatra, Sammie Davis Jr., etc.)  all eating here.  It really has that old-school, classy feel .I came here for some friends' B-days and was surprised that this type of establishment is located in Pico Rivera (no offense).  This was my second time at this place so I already had an idea of what I wanted to order. Their specialty is the pepper steak, which is topped with an assortment of vegetables/garnishments (i.e., green onions, bacon, etc..).  I really like this steak because the overall flavor just works.  I had my steak cooked medium well, and I think the way it was prepared also added to the overall flavor.  Along with my steak came a baked potato drenched with butter which was just okay.Service was great.  Our waitress (i forget her name) was awesome.  She was very attentive and informative.  Sometimes, waiters/waitresses can be too much, but this one was just right.  She always came to our table at the right time.Although we didn't get appetizers this time around, some good ones are the the ahi sashimi on toast and the oysters rockefeller, which I had the first time I was there.  Very good starters to the evening if you are willing to shell out the extra dough.This place isn't cheap (I ended up spending 60 bones because of my friends' birthdays) but this establishment is very classy and the food/service is great.  So if you're in the Pico Rivera/Whittier/Downey area, I suggest you give this place a try.  Hell, if you want to make the drive to here, that's all good too.  If you're on a date, be ready to spend in the triple digits.  Another tip, be ready with a camera because you might see a movie star.  We ended up sitting next to Edward James Olmos (Admiral Adama of Battle Star Galactica fame) and his family.",0
2977,6607,"Great balls of fire, Dal Rae is so damned close to 5 stars (I'd say 4.75), I find that rounding up is necessary... Nestled in the middle of nowhere, this little mare (horse speak LOL) is a hands down local champion!Service: AwesomeFood: EpicLocation: CoolValet: 3.50$ (can't beat it with a whiffleball bat)Had the oysters rockafeller with the gf, and it had us cheering for the chef. My steak and her sea bass were cooked to perfection. Throw in a stellar soufflé and you've got us giving out champ hands!!Thanks Dal Rae for having an amazing service staff and fabulous food. Now that were ""locals"" to the neighborhood, what better way to celebrate than a Dal Rae meal. Flemings may have to take a back seat to our evenings out....update: went with two lovely ladies last night and again, Dal Rae delivered as usual. great food, great service, and a wacky guitar player / singer in the bar lounge.",0
2978,6608,"If you dig old school steakhouses, then this is the place for you. White linen tablecloths, great Martinis, cushy booths, not too noisy, good dang food and a wonderful wait staff. They make a very delicious Caesar Salad table side. They also have bananas flambe for desert, nice! Get them both, for the good food and the the good time you'll have interacting with the gentleman who puts it all together for you. Steak was excellent and cooked perfectly.",0
2979,6609,"Just thinking about the Dal Rae brings a smile to my face and gets my mouth watering. There are two things one must do to enjoy Dal Rae to its fullest: 1) Resign yourself to the realization that you are about to consume a very large meal that will have you longing for a comfortable bed afterwards, and: 2) Be prepared to open up your wallet, and forget about money matters for a few hours--this is high-end continental cuisine, and food of this quality doesn't come cheap! The Dal Rae is truly a ""splurge"" for most of us folks--Live and enjoy!The cocktails are expertly prepared. The Dal Rae serves one of the very best martinis around. If that's your drink, you won't be disappointed.So very many fine choices on the menu: For starters, try the escargot, the sliced beefsteak tomato with crumbled blue cheese, and/or the French onion soup.For entrees, the fillet mignon pepper steak is hard to beat. The sauteed scallops are also excellent. If you have the extra time, the Chateaubriand for two is tender and superb. And, if you're one of the bold few, the sauteed calves' liver is tops.For dessert, try the ""bananas foster"" prepared table side.The owners, Lorin and Kevin, pamper their diners like movie stars, and the level of customer loyalty is extremely impressive. The Dal Rae is on the short list of my very favorite restaurants on planet earth. It's an especially enjoyable place to have a great meal with friends and family during the December holiday season.You may be able to get in for lunch without a reservation, but don't dream of showing up for dinner on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday night without a reservation. You'll be in for quite a wait.Viva Dal Rae!!!!!!!",0
2980,6610,"I went here again recently to celebrate a friend's birthday for lunch. Again the food was good and prices were slightly on the mid to higher side, as expected.Also again, it was loud. I don't know why they had to sit us right next to the only other full table that was being loud??",1
2981,6611,"Went for lunch with coworkers one day. Nice atmosphere inside, ample amount of tables... however that can cause it to get slightly loud inside.This place is really expensive for a restaurant in crappy Pico Rivera. That being said, my coworkers dishes all seemed really good (Chilean Sea Bass, and another seafood dish). I got something that resembled a huge cheeseburger on ciabatta bread, and it was a little too greasy for my tastes.I'd go here again, but only on special occasions. 3.5 stars, but I'll give the bump to 4.",0
2982,6612,I had a great experience here the other night when I went out to catch up with some old friends. Food and drinks was pretty good. I didn't really like how they brought the food out with brown food tray coverings though. It felt like I was being served food from an airplane or jail. Lol. Other than that all the workers there were so friendly and attentive. Super expensive (my bill for 4 people came out to be almost $400 not including tip) but good to do once in a while.,1
2983,6613,"After 17 years of living in the area, I finally made it here. Loved the valet when you drive in ($4.50) ypu won't have to worry about the parking.  The service was slow. The atmosphere was noisy and the bread was hard and cold. The mashed potatoes were bland. Food was ok. I expected more :(  Steak and Stein was 100 times better.",0
2984,6614,"We Love Love this place!Been coming here for years. Their pepper steak is out of this world, and my absolute FAVE is their Halibut ala Ben. It rocks! If you haven't tried thier fried goat cheese salad or Ahi on toast it's a must try!This place is an oldy but a goody. Do plan on spending some cash, but it's totally worth it.I rate it above Ruth Chris!As for servers, Donna rocks =) If you can make reservations with her do!",0
2985,6615,"I will be polite...!if you're a person of color don't go there.I think they would label their restrooms, ""White Only, colored only"" if they could get away with it.I was there for dinner on September 7, 2014. Yesterday.My White best friend and I went to Dal Rae for dinner.The reservation was under my name, a Latin Name. We walked  in an the hostes immediately refer to my friend and said ""welcome.""I felt a bit weirded-out by her lack of sensitivity and common sense.Once we were seated, another white woman, overweight, middle age, comes to the table, and greeted my friend and asked""what would you like to drink""?My friend asked me to answer first. I had to speak to my friend so he can refer the order to the waitress because she totally refused to acknowledge me at all. Every time I spoke, she looked at the other table and pretended not to hear what I was saying.It happened the 5 times she came to the table in the two-hour visit.I asked my friend if I had said anything wrong to have triggered such overtly sings of rejection. My friend said, I am blown away, but don't jump the gun.I was fine with that answer.Well, I filed a complaint with another worker and asked if that particular waitress had some issues with serving me. He communicated my concern to the racists waitress, andThree minutes later she rushed to the table, directly to my white friend, tapped him on the shoulder and said, ""I am so sorry, I did not mean to ignore you,""My friend very politely answered: you just proved what you have been accused of, overtly ignoring my friend here, pointing at me.""After getting caught with her pants down, she looked at me and apologized.Well, too late, I was the one paying the bill...Guess how much tip she got...........?Yep!!!",1
2986,6616,"Dal Rae is our go-to restaurant for date night or a celebration. The food is delicious, and the retro atmosphere is fun! We always make a reservation so we don't have to wait long. Their prime rib and crab legs are favorites!",0
2987,6617,"The food was very good, although I thought the mixed green salad looked like it was mostly iceberg lettuce. I had the veal medallions in a morel mushroom sauce. The veal was very tender and delicious as were the morels. The green beens in my opinion were slightly too crisp but my husband thought they were good that way. My husband had the sea bass and I sampled it. It also was perfectly prepared and delicious. The only gripe I have about the food is that the bread was served room temperature and the butter was hard, so buttering my bread was a challenge. Restaurants: ONLY SERVE WARM BREAD. We also didn't get a relish tray, but it's just as well as we ran low on time anyway.The service was very slow, we assume due to the kitchen. It was Valentine's day and it looked like they were running with a scaled sown menu. I didn't see soufflés and other time sinks on the menu that night. We didn't have time for dessert, unfortunately. Waiting for a table and the meal took over 2 1/2 hours. We should have planned for 3 hours, even though we ordered our whole meal at once and didn't have drinks before dinner or coffee after.Expect to sit a bit closer to your neighbors than most Los Angeles restaurants. They really wedge in a lot of tables and chairs. My husband shared his seat with the potted palm. While we appeared to be the only gay couple in the place we didn't feel uncomfortable, other than the guy at the next table who seemed to have issues.The wait staff was friendly and professional. The hostess taking the names at the front was a bit stressed out as it was valentine's day and they were running very behind. We arrived 10 minutes early for our 7:30 reservation by weren't seated until 7:50. They said they didn't have any more pagers although we kept seeing them hand them out. So we had to stand in the very small entry way that would open up to the smokers standing outside the door. It was unpleasant. They should ask the smokers to step away from the entry way.",1
2988,6618,"all i have to say is wow.. delicious food, quality cuts of steak..i didnt know such place existed in pico rivera...",1
2989,6619,"It's 2016 and I'm not old enough to remember when Sinatra was cool, but I can dream, Baby! The Dal Rae is so old school Sinatra-cool. There's no place like it...there was even a really talented torch singer in the bar, and singing what?...yes, Sinatra  (but also John Legend!) We were having a business dinner, but we saw people on dates, family dinners, a birthday dinner party, and what was common? Everyone was enjoying the ambiance, the great service, and the food and beverages! Great big menu with everything good,  but the bone in ribeye or the prime rib is meat that's hard to beat!",1
2990,6620,"I have never wrote a review but  I just attended this weekend for My 18th wedding anniversary I was super excited .. When we arrived at the resultant with another couple we got placed in  a back patio area where the waitress were in and out, service was super slow and I felt that we were just forgotten about. The food was good, creme brûlée excellent but it took a while for our drinks and I seen that there was entertainment in the restaurant which would have been a nice experience . I just hope if I decide to try it again I don't get the same service. I know it's a little more upscale I hope we weren't treated this way depending on our looks .",0
2991,6621,"3.5 really... and note: this review is regarding the BF and I just popping in for drinks and a desert.I had heard/read good things about this place and wanted to try itWe had dinner elsewhere in Pico and on the way home I thought why not stop there for a drink... well it turned out to be a fab idea.There was a guy at the bar w/ a guitar singing and we really enjoyed it.Sure its pricey but its about as much as I used to spend on drinks when I would go out clubbing, its just these days I prefer a place to sit and be mellow... the BF and I really liked the live music, for being just one dude he was quite good and he took our requests did some John Mayer for me, some Billy Joel for the BF... it was quite lovely",1
2992,6622,"My friends wanted to do a dineLA group dinner and they chose this restaurant. Dress code was semi-formal and it was considered ""fine dining."" When I told my boyfriend this place is in Pico Rivera, he said, ""This must be some fancy taco and burrito restaurant, cause there are no fine dining in Pico Rivera."" Haha!Much to our surprise this place was indeed pretty fancy! Button downs for guys and blouses/dresses for girls. We all got the 3 course menu, with appetizers ranging from artichokes, fried calamari, and sashimi ahi, with main course ranging from steak, salmon, and another that I don't remmeber, and with dessert from creme brulee, sundae, and something else. (I have terrible memory)What I did not forget was how fantastic the steak was! It was soft and juicy (I got medium rare) and everyone was raving about it. It was probably the best steak I've ever had so far. Everyone loved their meal (except for some who chose the artichokes for appetizer lol). We also got escargos (fabulous! - the only ones that was better than this was the one in Paris) and raw oysters.Parking is valet and about $3.50. I don't know how they set that price but we all had a fantastic experience. It's great for couples who wants something romantic and for big groups as well.Very recommended!",0
2993,6623,"My parents have brought me here since I was little and I still order the same thing to this day...I start off with Oysters Rockfeller--that is a MUST you do not get the full experience if you do not order it!!!I use to love the Chilean sea bass until the waiter who is from Paris decided to start making me steak tar tar at table side which I don't think is even on the menu.For dessert that same wonderful French waiter makes me crepes suzette (at table side as well)If you come here long enough, the staff will appreciate you and pretty much make you whatever you want on or off the menu.Dal Rae is Pico Riveras hidden gem for sure and from the outside you would have never guessed that this place is serving up premiere dishes.",0
2994,6624,"I come here I would argue at Least once a month God willing. I love their steak. Food presentation not bad. Flavor is awesome. Food melts in your mouth! Pricey, but worth spoiling yourself once in a while",1
2995,6625,"My boyfriends family took us here for our birthdays last week. It was ok. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't impressed either. Steak and lobster...that's pretty much what they are known for here. They also have some fish, sandwhiches and pasta choices--but I don't think people come here for that. You really aren't paying for the food here. I mean in a sense you are, but its more the ambiance you're paying for...its one of those flashback retro restaurants...I had the 10oz lobster tail with veggies and rice pilaf...it was pretty darn good. But I had issues with the way it was served to me---that's why i give it 3 stars...The waitress came to our table with all the food, and then because 3 people out of my 6 people party ordered lobster, took the meat of the lobster tail out in front of our table. I would've been ok with not seeing her do that, and even better without seeing her take out 2 more. It was sort of a mess. She was flicking and sticking and poking...veggies were flyin off the tray--and she was tryin to make the plate neat again, but it was a struggle... It was kind of awkward to be sitting there waiting to eat, while she dug out lobster meat to serve the other two people....isn't that supposed to be done in the back?It was a nice place. Good service, friendly staff....they even brought my bf and I cake and sang to us. Which was really nice.Nice place to go to once in a while...very pricey. Just don't know if i ever will....",1
2996,6626,"After moving to Lakewood a couple of years ago, I try to find things I liked in my old area nearer to me. One example is a Caesar salad prepared at the table and a chocolate souffle for dessert. My previous location was Arroyo Cop House in Pasadena. Dal Rae kind of offers these things, but were pretty average about it.My wife and I tried the place during Dine LA and tried it a second time. I find it weird to read how our salads are prepared table side, but instead of any preparation, it being made with no interaction off in a corner behind us. Why not just have it made in the back of the house and brought out. Both the taste and the presentation of their Caesar and their souffle were very mediocre. I also felt that once it was clear my wife and I only wanted salad, a couple of apps and a souffle, we were politely tolerated by our waitress. Never rude, but I suppose we were looked at as a small ticket and not worthy of real effort. But we're not going to eat excessively to make strangers happy.Maybe because we've had so much better at Arroyo Chop House, in terms of taste, presentation and service, it really left this place feeling extremely mediocre. Nothing wrong as much as nothing all that right, we'll drive the extra distance next time.",1
2997,6627,"I ate here with my girlfriend on my birthday. We started out with martinis... mine regular hers Apple. It was fine, nothing to write home about, but decent. The wait staff then brought out a veggie plate and a variety of breads. Both were pretty good. We then ordered the deep fried zucchini which was very crispy and delicious. It was served with both ranch and marinara sauce. Next we had the Caesar salad made for two which was done tableside. It was a bit salty but over all not bad. I ordered the diamond Brady cut prime rib which was over 20 ounces! This by far was the best tasting item that evening. The seasoned crust around the prime rib absolutely amazing! My girlfriend ordered the filet mignon. She said it was quite delicious. The wait staff then surprised me with a slice of chocolate cake which was very chocolatey. Overall it was a very good experience. I will definitely come back soon.",1
2998,6628,"Not many steakhouses around this area and here is a great one at that.  I can see how it's a ""hole in the wall"" as well as a hidden gem.  Never heard of Dal Rae before but a friend invited me here for lunch.  What makes this place good is the ""Peppercorn Steak"" in either NY or Filet cut.  It is absolutely to die for as the flavoring is strong with its healthy embellishment of their peppercorn marinade topping.  Also, the steak cut is quality meat cooked to perfection, a la medium rare.I've also tried the Rack of Lamb and it is fairly good but not as good as other places or as flavorful as the Peppercorn Steak.  Also, their French Onion Soup is good.  Forgo the Lobster Bisque unless that is your thing.This place reminds me of a glamorous steakhouse from a era in the past. It's classy and cozy and makes you feel warm.  Great place for a date.For the price and quality of the food, its a good deal.  If you haven't tried Dal Rae and looking for a great steakhouse around this area, definitely give this place a try.",0
2999,6629,"One of the iconic restaurants in the LA-area, the Dal Rae offers a unique dining experience that takes you back to the 1950's-60's. The interior is classy and retro, the servers are professionals, not just a bunch of college kids.  There's always classic music and, if you want the full experience, suit up to attend.My favorite selection off the menu is the bone-in Filet Mignon. Suitably priced at $44, this may be the most tender and flavorful cut of steak you'll ever have.The drinks are great, the desserts enjoyable and you get to valet park for rather cheap. Absolutely recommended.",1

3001,6631,"Classy, very attentive, great classic place to go upscale.  Only reason for 4 rather than 5 was that our table was cramped and kept having to move around to let servers through.  Pics attached - food was very good.  Top choices here: Any kind of steak or their Chilean Sea Bass - beyond good.  Pics attached here.",1
3002,6632,"We love this restaurant! We came here to celebrate our 50th wedding anniversary with family. We had been here once before and loved it so much wanted to come here again with our family. We loved the ambiance. We started with cocktails and shared appetizers of crab stuffed artichoke bottoms, oysters on the half shell and escargots bourguignonne. For the main coarse we ordered a variety of dishes, chilean seabass alla ben, filet mignon pepper steak, and one of us ordered the surf and turf, filet mignon and seabass. All the food was amazing, melt in your mouth. The service was impeccable. The prices are high but worth every penny. On a scale of 1-10 we give it an 11!",0
3003,6633,"We made a reservation over a month in advance for a party of 8.  This restaurant came highly receimmnded by our L.A. Friends.6 of us drove up from OC.  We arrived 20 minutes early.  The hostess was fantastic.  She sat us right away.  While we waited for our friends our waitresses Hilga and Michelle introduced themselves.  They immediately offered to open up a couple of reds we brought.  Great start to wonderful evening.Michelle suggested a couple of apps that were outstanding. Steak medallions and giant prawns.  So good.We all had a caesar salad that was made table side. Our group loves sharing their entrees.  We all had a taste of the Sea Bass, Steak Diane, Peppercorn Steak, Filet and Halibut.  For dessert we had Bananas Flambe and Soufflé.It was a fantastic evening.  The food was outstanding.  Thank you Hilga and Michelle for taking great care of us.  Dal Rae is a must visit.  The drive was well worth it.",1
3004,6634,Great place...! Especially for celebration or a special event...looks like crap from the outside but you'll be surprised when you walk in. It's a Hidden Gem. Try the calamari Highly recommended.,0
3005,6635,"AMBIANCEParking is valet only, but only cost $3.50 the night we went (Thursday). Very romantic restaurant. Dim lighting, live piano playing and singing, classy and relaxed. Definitely a place to bring a date for a special occasion. However, the crowd that frequents this restaurant is definitely much older so if you're looking for a young, hip and chic place to go, this is NOT the place.SERVICEThe service was average in my opinion. The food took EXCEPTIONALLY long to get to our table. We ordered their famous peppered steak and it took almost an hour! We also had to ask more than once to bring certain items to the table. You better set aside a couple hours out of your day if you're planning to come here!FOODThe food was GREAT. We ordered the Casar salad and famous New York Peppered steak cooked Medium rare. They start out with white bread and a platter of fresh cut vegetables on ice. The Caesar salad was prepared fresh in front of our table and then the most AMAZING cheesy herb bread was served. It is a MUST HAVE! The peppered steak was juicy, tender and flavorful and definitely lived up to all the hype surrounding it.OVERALLThis restaurant is located in a not -so-great neighborhood so it is easily missed if you didn't know it was there, but it is def a diamond in the rough. I enjoyed this place and will definitely be back.",0
3006,6636,"Sir Dal Rae deserves 5 stars for a few reasons.Relish tray comes to the table along with bread first thing. The relish tray is fresh and really good stuff.Food was prepared to perfection. Service was tops. You can sit and enjoy your meal without being rushed. The most novel part is; you can actually hear the people you are dining with. The noise level is very accommodating.Valet Parking which I agree with. For $3.50 you can exit and enter your vehicle directly at the front door.The bar is friendly and they pour a good drink. Music commences about 1900 hours. Old School R & B which is really fun.  Not sure how many nights a week or how often they change the entertainment.I've not been here since the 1980. Not for any reason except I just didn't, but will be making it a point to frequent Dal Rae more often!Sorry Dal Rae.  The last three times I've dined with you have been less than satisfactory.  I ordered Lobster which I sent back. The new Lobster was dry, fishy and plain awful.  No better than the first one.",0
3007,6637,"Friend of mine took me here about a month ago and im still thinking about the prime rib...It was sooo gooood.Totally Vegas style old school. Although people dress up to come here, I saw some tshirt and jeans folks...they were seated in the patio of course...lolBread pudding was also awesome!",0
3008,6638,"A long wait time to be seated despite having reservations. The salad was not appealing , tasty or anything special . The bread was not very fresh .. very hard to eat . We waited over an hour to be served our food... ugh. The food presentation was nice but not worth the wait or the price . Never returning !",1
3009,6639,We had a great night!! I had the pepper steak and i loved it! Great service and ambiance. It's an old school family restaurant feel. I will be Back!*Valet charge if you use their parking.,0
3010,6640,"Went to dal Rae for my b-day last year.  Did not make a reservation but we were seated promptly on a Wednesday night.You must have that 'prepared at your table' Caesars salad..it was delicious. I had the swordfish- YUMMY!My husband and son had the house specialty pepper steak which they said was good but not necessarily to die for...their bread pudding was so warm and yummy. I would go back..on a special occasion of course due to price--Went back already since i began writing my review...it takes me a while-lolThis time we went on a Friday night with a party of 13. There is entertainment on the weekends and I must say this guy is GOOD- he is a one man show and the music he sings will take you back. He is really really good!Food once again was good- however service leaves to be desired.Both times we were served by same waitress in the bar area- older lady...not too attentive...Some of us waited around for drinks, trying to catch her attention, like i said, service left us with a sour feeling.Entertainment, food and atmosphere were good.Overall 2 stars for service-4 stars for food & 5 stars for entertainment",0
3011,6641,"Best steak I've ever had, amazing atmosphere (1950s architecture), great Caesar salad and cheese bread, great dessert. This place never fails to impress, hands down.P.S. If you're more of a fish person, get the Sea Bass!",0

As a NYC transplant I've been to the best, they have NOTHING over The Dalrae.Salads prepared table side (as you like it), along with a  complementary crudite' platter and bread basket.  My wife and I shared the Chateaubriand steak. Perfectly prepared, the steak could be cut with a fork.YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!If you still have room for dessert, their famous Souffle is to die for.",0

I miss going there! use to be the spot!!!!!! but now I moved!!!!will visit again soon! Filet Mignon is good, Garlic Shrimp app, and the Poor Man Pepper steak! ugh everything is!!!!!!!! mmmmOh yeah the area is shit! its looks so gross on the outside! Pico Is just kind of nasty! BUT once you walk in you feel like your in a 5 star restaurant! parking is only vallet! don't like that! I hate that I can't park my own car! but a great place to take a date or business partner! Cute place to seduce your partner as well ahahahahha",1
3016,6646,Been going for 30 years and it's always been good. It's location in PR is off the beaten track but the food is worth it.,1
3017,6647,I can't believe an expensive place like this can't make a good Old Fashion. I had one that tasted like a soft drink. Come on owners get some good mixologist on board. I had the drink taken back and ordered a whisky neat instead.,0
3018,6648,"Hung out at the bar for drinks only. I realize it was a busy night and there were only 2 bartenders.  I started to ask the bartender about the entertainment , he looked at me and walked away without saying anything. He heard me tell my date how rude he was AND then from the other side of the bar he gave me the information. The bar area is definitely for the ""regulars"" and so is the good service.",0
3019,6649,"Restaurants like this do not exist anymore, a real classic! This is a family owned and operated restaurant (for two generations) and you won't find another place like this anymore. The food is top notch, the service is splendid, the decor is right in line with what you would hope for in a 1950s-like experience. This is not your average dining experience!",0
3020,6650,Went here with my boyfriend and parents for my boyfriends birthday and we all loved it. Food was delicious and cooked to perfection. Usually when I order my steak medium rare most places don't get it right but Del Rae did. I will defiantly be returning,0
3021,6651,This is old money. Love this place but I only stayed long enough to have the bread and a drink. The place was busy. It's very mid century with a modern twist.  I've heard the food is good. BTW not a fan of walking through people smoking right in front of the entrance. Gross.,1
3022,6652,"An amazing restaurant in Pico Rivera, really? You bet....Interestingly enough this gem sits between Jack in the Box and a foot specialist. Once you step in, you know you've stepped into something good. The classic dark panels, dim lights and arrangement of tables definitely takes you back in time. The servers are attentive, the drinks are stiff, and they have a great wine selection.Having tasted about half of the menu, the Pepper Filet is by far my favorite, in the mood for seafood? the lobster thermidor is rich but decadent. Need a starter salad? the Caesar is awesome! In the mood for potatoes? the garlic mashed are a winner. Please, please, please save room for dessert, the Chocolate and/or Grand Marnier souflee are a perfect finish, not to eggy. In the mood for a cold dessert, they also have an amazing creme brulee.This place is great for a special date, an anniversary or if your in the mood for a great meal....be prepared to spend a bit for possibly one of the best meals you'll ever have.Make your reservations now and maybe I'll see you there!",0
3023,6653,Over ten years ago I was very lucky to come to the Dal Rae for dinner - it was a memorable experience!   My brother and his wife had promised me that when I was forty they would take me back!  Well I just went there this past weekend (eight years after my fortieth birthday!) BUT the wait was well worth it!Of course the fabulous relish tray and then I choose not to have a starter or soup or salad (too much food) and I really worked on finishing my lobster thermidor - absolutely delicious- just as I remembered.The people in the lounge all seemed to be having a great time too!,0
3024,6654,"For me it was a good LOCAL higher end restaurant that encouraged good attire. Since I live locally (cerritos), which has a myriad of local eating, but no higher end eateries, Del Rae was good and close.  The peppered steak was tender, but not full off ""beefyness"" as it was a filet cut....expected..sea bas was excellent, tender and sweet. Scampi were huge, but ever so slightly over cooked, and not as tender as possible.  Overall excellent  With the  Sea bass being the best dinner dish still far of my 3 choices.",0
3025,6655,"Wow. A great meal was had, with amazing service. Peppered filet with bacon for me, my companion had a Parmesan crusted sea bass. We split a table prepared Caesar salad; lite on the anchovies for me, normal for her. Fantastic service, amazing food. A bit of a drive, and not cheap, but worth it. Nice piano bar, btw, with music on Wednesday, Friday, and Saurday nights. More reason to wish it was closer.",0
3026,6656,"Came here for the Mother's Day menu.  The hostess did not sit me according to our reservation.  It wasn't until 20 minutes of waiting passed that she said she was waiting for me.  For me to do what?  Although the waitress was attentive, the food lacked in flavor and preparation.  The filet mignon was ordered medium and came back medium rare (closer to rare).  I do not like the charcoaled flavor when they put it back on the grill, but I tried for the sake of the occasion.  Came back flavorless and disappointing. Kids ordered the prime rib medium well.  That came back medium rare as well.  My son ordered the pasta which was also bland.  Overall very disappointing.  I think you would have better at Steak and Stein and/or even Outback.",0
3027,6657,"I want to thank Maline for a great dinner program. We filled the private room with attendees and started serving dinner at 7. I am not kidding, there must have been at least 10 late attendees who came as late as 8:30. We received a larger than anticipated crowd due to the excellent food provided. We were adding chairs, an additional table, and providing full meals to even these late-show guests. Maline handled everything in stride and with a confident demeanor. The service was not only awesome, but also extremely beneficial for our guests to notice minimal distractions as they listened to the lecture. I also want to thank all those who supported Maline when things got a little hectic. Great team effort on behalf of the Dal Rae!",0
3028,6658,Two of their top dishes in a surf and turf meal. Sea Bass and Pepper steak!  No two better combo in the world! And I been all over the world!,1
3029,6659,"Food was excellent, and our Server was very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. His name was Robert I believe. Every time he came to our table he had a contagious smile. Steak was cooked to perfection. It pricey but worth it.",0
3030,6660,"Overall: Good food.  Good Googie building and decor. Somewhat high prices. Robin Thicke music didn't really fit the claimed 50s atmosphere.The vegetable appetizers on ice were tasty.  I imagine this was authentic to the 50s period.  Mostly because of the celery.The cheesy garlic toast appeared right before the food came out.  An unexpected load of caloric awesomeness, each weighty slice required two hands to lift.The sea bass was very good, but unusually cheesy.   A chewy layer of cheese was baked on top and bottom of the fish.  Unusual, but very tasty.  The fish flesh was juicy as others have mentioned.  Is this 1950s dining?Friends at the table who ate pepper steak noted the meal was about what was on the steak, and not the steak itself.  Nevertheless, everyone enjoyed their dishes.",0
3031,6661,"Would give it 5-stars if it weren't for the drink prices and the valet aspect.  However tops on the oysters (any on the ways and varieties), table-side Caesar, any steak.  $8 for a Stella not so hot (could buy a six-pack around the corner for less), and I won't tell you the prices for a Grey Goose (neat).  Wines are very pricey as well.Been there six times and always the same, though I believe the cost of the valet has gone up in the last 4 years.",0
3032,6662,This restaurant is a great place!  Goes back many years and still the same.  Love the atmosphere and great food and always a nice welcoming.,1
3033,6663,The food at Dal Rae is amazing. I highly recommend the petite filet pepper steak it was mouth watering and flavorful. For dessert defiantly try the chocolate soufflé it will satisfy your palate. Thank you for your wonderful service Heidi.,0
3034,6664,"I came here on a Thursday night; brought my boyfriend for his birthday. Excellent service, fantastic table-side Caesar salad and pepper-steak. I had the petite filet mignon and he had the new york cut. The steaks came with asparagus and your choice of mashed potatoes or brown rice (if I remember correctly.) I had the mashed potatoes and they were okay. I wasn't impressed but if you're a fan of mashed potatoes - anything will do, really! I want to go back and try the halibut - sounded delicious.side notes: valet service $3.50, you pay at the end of the night. they offer fresh veggies and bread&butter as appetizers. with our steaks we received garlic bread - which was really good.",0
3035,6665,Great place.  Old school. Great service and great food. Had the peppered steak.  It was very good.    Good for business meetings.,1
3036,6666,nice old school fancy dining.  fried calamari was meaty and crispy.  done well served with tomato sauce.  house salad was simple with vinaigrette.chilean seabass with asparagus was buttery and yummy.  the seabass was moist and tender.dessert was yum..chocolate moussee and cheesecakeeee! so fluffy and light.parking is valet...$4.50,0

3038,6668,"This is my first time coming here and the minute we walked in we were greeted by a rude employee. I didn't get her name, but she's a blonde slim lady. Horrible! She was sarcastic, not welcoming, and not personable. We made reservations for 7:00 and it's 7:20 and still waiting and she couldn't care more if we're waiting.",0
3039,6669,"This place looks very unappealing on the outside, which is why I have driven past it hundreds of times and never noticed it. The inside is dark and expensive-looking. We were immediately served a basket of crackers and pickled vegetables, which I did not even touch. Unappetizing.I started with a oysters rockefeller, which was simply amazing. It was creamy and bacony and oh so good! Everything about the dish tasted excellent. For my entree, I split a pepper-steak and a lobster thermador. Both entrees included vegetables and a baked potato. I ordered the steak medium well  but the steak came well done, which still tasted pretty good. The lobster was excellent.There were a couple of things that need to improve:1. They need to improve their vegetables which were overly tough.2. While the service was NOT friendly, the staff got the job done.3. $3.50 for valet parking? Seriously? Give me the option of parking it myself please.",0
3040,6670,Good drinks!!!,1
3041,6671,So I have always seen this place but never tried it. So when it came up on dine in LA week I figured why not? Ordered the peppered steak with baked potato. I have to admit the baked potato was better then the steak. Lol maybe I ordered the wrong thing but steak was lacking flavor. Don't think I would go back but at least I can say I tried it.,0
3042,6672,"My husband and I go because it is best steak house near us. We usually go for his birthday. He usually gets some sort of steak, I believe Prime Rib. I ordered Chilean Sea Bass this time around and it was so good. This is truly how fish should be cooked. It melted in my mouth. I only wish the tables were a little more private since we sat facing this big family party of about 12 and it was a little noisier. They luckily eventually left. Customer service is usually excellent and they have very friendly staff.",0
3043,6673,"Shared the tomahawk steak with the husband, talk about a wonderful steak! Both of us couldn't finish our split steak it was marvelous darling!! Drinks very healthy side were amazing we both had mashed potatoes and steamed veggies amazing. !! Will",0
3044,6674,"Dark wood paneling, dim lit interior, and booths galore...this is definitely the place where Pico Rivera politicians and power brokers go to grease the wheels.  But you know what, that just adds to the atmosphere, you never know what's being dealt in the booth next to you!The food was very good.  They have a $35 Sun-Thurs dinner menu that includes appetizer, an entree, and dessert.  We tried the ahi tuna sandwich and it was great.  I also ordered the hearts of romaine salad, which was fantastic ($10.50).  They do no skimp on the blue cheese.  The medium rare petite filet that came with the special was overcooked and bleh, and would have cost this place a couple of stars had the waitress not gotten us a new steak that was just amazing.  Don't be afraid to ask for what you ordered!  The bone-in ribeye was juicy and seasoned just right... much better than the one I had a Ruth's Chris, and cheaper too at 37.50.  For some reason, Ruth's always overcooks the outside of the steak but since the interior is red warm, they claim they did their job.  You don't have to accept that kind of mediocrity, come to Dal Rae.Oh, and the dessert... definitely get the chocolate souffle (20 min extra).  It's pricey at 10.50 (though these days some restaurants have the gall to charge $14.00 or more for lesser sweets), but it's enough for two people.  You won't be disappointed.  The tiramisu that came with the special was not that great though, way too sweet and the cherry sauce had no business being on there.  So a 4.5 but I will round up.",0
3045,6675,"Extravagance personified.  Old school at its finest.  This place has been around since 1958 and oddly enough I just went for the first time the other night.  I must admit, they have a very diverse fine-dining menu, with everything from chateaubriand, lobster thermidor, oysters rockefeller, all your various cuts of rib-eyes, prime ribs, porterhouses, new yorks both bone-in and without, fresh fish of the day, poultry, pasta,  tons of salads and appetizers and sides, and cherries jubilee and souffles for dessert.  A competant wine list and a full bar complete the picture.This is a place you go to be pampered in style.  The service here was very good, and the food was good as well.  Everyone in the place seemed to be enjoying themselves.  Since I was dining alone, I think just about every server in the place as well as the manager came over to ask me if everything was alright.  I guess I must have looked bored to them, but the truth was I just checking out the place and doing my people watching thing.My first impression is that this would be a great place to take a date.  It's definitely a place where I could spend a good amount of loot over a period of time to try a lot of items on the menu, and I hope to be returning sometime in the near future.",1
3046,6676,Ordered the table side ceasar salad  and it was the most delicious salad I've ever had. Now I know how a Ceasar salad should taste like. The chiliean sea bass was melt in your mouth amazing. Will definitely be returning !,0
3047,6677,"I went to Del Rae last night for DineLA. I had theCrab Cakes - chili cilantro cream sauce,Petite Pepper Filet Mignon - their ""signature"" steakCreme BruleeThe crab cakes was excellent. One of the better crab cakes I can remember. But then again, I haven't any in awhile. The petite pepper filet Mignon was good and interesting. They had a beef/bacon topping on the steak. I used some of it on my baked potato.  That was yummy.  I was a bit disappointed with the creme Brulee though. It was a bit thick for my taste. I had better creme Brulee at other places. What was weird, was the veggies they put out with the bread. What do you eat that with?  The meal was worth the $34 dinner considering the Petite Pepper filet Mignon was regularly $32.  I would repeat, but not for awhile. I rather go to Flemings or Mortons first though.",0
3048,6678,"I've been twice.First time I had duck a l'orange (tasty) and bananas foster (amazing).Second time I had the pepper steak. This was the one an only time I've had pepper steak and my guess is that I just don't like pepper steak no matter where it comes from. Theirs is supposed to be amazing, but it felt like I was eating straight pepper with some steak mixed in.",0
3049,6679,"I've passed by this place for YEARS without knowing that Del Rae is a restaurant. I really thought it was an old bowling alley or something. It doesn't exactly get your attention for being glamorous. However, one glance into the parking lot and you know this place is upscale. Plenty of beautiful cars outside.It is dimly lit, so it's definitely a dinner sort of place. Great place to take a date (hopefully someone you've been seeing for a while as the prices are quite steep), or a fancy family outing. Wouldn't recommend children, though.The service was excellent, we didn't have to wait too long for anything to arrive. I will say that the caesar salad I enjoyed was probably the best caesar salad I have ever had. Anywhere.I ordered the filet mignon, medium-rare, and it was delicious. Cooked perfectly to my liking, particularly juicy.Great experience overall.",0

Not my favorite fish either.Dissapointed by the oysters Rockerfeller and the chopped salad.Prices are in line with such places.  No surprises there.I'll be back.",1

Super rich, but every once in a while it's okay to eat like this! They started us out with a relish tray and fresh baked bread, yum! Appetizers included escargot and baked brie. Both were wonderful.We did order one item that was prepared table side, a wilted spinach salad with (say it like Homer) BACON! It was pretty good, but the balsamic was a bit over powering.Entrees included were the Poor man's pepper steak, which was so full of flavor. The Chilean sea bass a la Ben was so good! it was nice and moist. Halibut and was juicy as well. Chicken piccata looked delicious, but I actually didn't try it.This was my second time here, and will definitely return.",0
3052,6682,This place was fantastic!  Took my wife for our anniversary and I can't wait to go back.Try the banana's foster for dessert.  You won't regret it.,1
3053,6683,I been coming here for a while now and I had to change my reservations for the next day... the reception lady was really rude but it doesn't mean that the food is not good! the food is great and the service is great... receptionists needs a little work!,0
3054,6684,Del Rae did it again!! I had the Hamburger Steak with Mushroom sauce!!!!!Great Service and a Bar what more can a guy ask for....Try the Grand Marnier Ice cream dessert!!!,0
3055,6685,"I came here with my co-workers for a company sponsored dinner.  The food at this place is amazing!  The crowd was a bit older and the staff was very nice.  Everything here was great!  I did not taste anything that I didn't like.  I personally had the prime rib, house salad with anchovy dressing, and coffee.  This is certainly a place for special occasions as the price will certainly reflect.Would definitely recommend and come back again.",0
3056,6686,"Most of the stars come from the ambiance... very fancy.  Prices reflect that.  I had the seared ahi tuna, which had some parts that were sort of inedible and chewy.  I wanted to get the Chilean sea bass but didn't want to be any more un-environmental than I already felt on this first steakhouse trip.The groups sitting around us were obnoxiously loud, and some people were having a gift exchange in the valet lot as the parkers were trying to get all the cars out.  Entitlement much?",0
3057,6687,"This is one of those places With a sense of entitlement... A little pompous and traditional, straight forward efficient service, no frills! I love their steaks but I am partial to their fish... The ahi steak...I have no words... The cocktails are always legendary and lethal... Old school classy in Pico Rivera... Must experience!!!",0
3058,6688,"This steak house is by far better than Flemings.  The amount of food you get is twice as much also.  I had the Rib-eye bone in peppered steak.  My goodness...it was PURRRRFECT!  Came with 2 sides so I chose rice pilaf (kinda bland, earthy and nutty) and steamed vegetables.  I would have given Dal Rae a perfect 5 if the sides were a little bit better.  Other than that, the staff were pleasant and the atmosphere was great.  Definitely going back!",0
3059,6689,I love the atmosphere at this restaurant.  The wait staff is outstanding and the fresh garlic bread is wonderful.  I also love the relish tray.  I would recommend Del Rae's just for the experience.,1
3060,6690,"Service: excellent service with very friendly and knowledgable staffDecor: a bit outdated but that actually added to the ""old school"" steakhouse feel.Food: one of the best steaks I ever had. Salads were excellent, side dishes were flavorful and dessert was outstandingPrice: I bit on the high side but you get your money's worthWould go back but only on a special occasion due to the price.",0
3061,6691,"I called about hiring a limo to go from my place to Pico Rivera, and the limo guy said "" The Dal Rae, right? Whenever anyone's going to Pico Rivera, it's always the Dal Rae..."" Couldn't have said it better myself. This is the ultimate throwback place for steaks, chops and martinis --you're convinced when you walk in that you just saw Sammy, Dean and Frank out of the corner of your eye.Good wine list, but with $20 corkage this is a great place to bring those Napa cabs and 1er Cru Bordeaux you've been saving. Lots of table-side dishes, like Caesar salad and bananas foster. Good, stiff drinks at the bar. Piano. Friendly service. And some of the best steaks you can get anywhere. Order one of their big-as-a-linebacker's-fist filet mignons, ""Pepper Steak"" style. Highly recommend this place.",0
3062,6692,"After reading a lot of other Yelp reviews, I was a bit nervous about how the service would be.  My boyfriend and I decided to go on a Monday night, and while there were a lot of people there, it wasn't a full house.  The service wasn't super quick, but it wasn't slow either.  Our waitress Gabriella was also very attentive and kept coming by to see how we were doing.  The food was excellent.  He had a Large Filet Minon Pepper Steak with garlic mashed potatoes, which was cooked exactly the way he wanted it and was very flavorful.  I had the Chicken Breast with Wild Mushrooms, and while the chicken was slightly overdone for me, it still tasted very good.For dessert, we had the Banana Flambe for 2, which is prepared tableside.  You get a lot for what you pay, and we couldn't even finish ours.My boyfriend also ordered a Jack and Coke, and it was made just right, which is kinda rare for him.Overall, we had a good night and we'll probably come back here again.  It's quite expensive and parking is only valet since the lot is so small, but it's definitely worth trying.  I recommend coming on a weeknight though, not sure how the service would be on a weekend.",0
3063,6693,"Been going since 1958 I am from PR, the only place for special events or just a great dinner price's are worth it for the best steaks, chopped salad etc. Don't go all the time but it's always special when we are there.",1
3064,6694,"I'm a local and have been coming here for years, it's the most upscale place in area were youcan have a quality meal and not have to drive to OC or LA. The must try's are, the table side Cesar, sea bass al la ben, prime rib, garlic mash potatoes, bananas foster made table side or molten chocolate cake. The cocktail are always nice and stiff here! Atmosphere is class yet vibrant and fun.",0
3065,6695,"I absoloutely love this place. I usually get the prime rib. Always made to perfection ( nice and juicy). The service is great. It's always busy but never have to wait a long time  to get a table. It's a bit pricey but totally worth it. Will recommend to anyone, try it!!",0
3066,6696,"My wife and I and our two adult daughters arrived at about 6 PM on the Wednesday before Christmas and the place was packed. We had phoned at about 5 PM and were told that the first reservation for the dining room was 9:30 but we probably could get a table in the lounge. The information was correct and we were immediately seated. As usual, the food and service was outstanding. My wife and I both ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and we also shared a Filet Mignon. My daughters have somewhat restricted diets so they had prime ribs and steak respectively. We all shared a couple of appetizers (Giant shrimp cocktail and oysters Rockefeller). We all had more than we could eat so we had the balance of the meals for dinner Thursday. Dal Rae is not inexpensive (our bill was $307 plus tip) but the quality of the food and the skill in its preparation makes it worthwhile",0
3067,6697,"This was my first time in Pico Rivera, and the restaurant was very easy to find. The LED sign was so bright it could probably be seen from outer space. Here are my thoughts...Good for what it is: an old time steak, seafood and chops place.Ambiance: This is a place the older set can appreciate. It should be noted that on the Saturday night when I was here there was a super loud drunk dude, and it was only 7:00PM! He was like a hillbilly at a country club. (Thankfully he left with his crew around 8:30)Food: Scampi was really good. The shrimp were moist and soft, and the sauce was just garlicy enough. I used the french bread to sop the extra sauce. Oysters on the half shell were plump and sweet and didn't have any shucking damage (i.e. when the shucking knife slips and mangles the oyster).  Cesar salad prepared table side was properly crunchy and fresh, but only had three small croutons. Oh well. At least they brought out the garlic-cheese toast. Rack of lamb was cooked perfectly at medium rare and came with a reduction sauce that wasn't strained so it had those bits from the pan. Finished out meal with the Grand Marnier souffle, but I suspect they used the cheaper Cointreau because the souffle was very white and Grand Marnier is brandy-based so it's very brown. But wow, it was still fantastic! It had the crispy fluffy outer crust and soft middle. Served with whipped cream and some sort of creme anglaise.Service: Timing was perfect. Servers were very nice. I think we were there for three hours.Good for what it's not: trendy!",0
3068,6698,"Last minute lunch here on my birthday. Totally did not plan to eat here but saw it on the way to my next destination and decided to stop and have a bite to eat. Seen valet service so I figured it had to be a decent place. Honestly the location itself is kind of bizzare because it's kind of an upscale restaurant in a rough part of town. But anyways the restaurant itself is good. The waitress was very friendly and even the bus staff was super friendly as well. Usually I would have ordered the seafood platter for an appetizer at a place like this but I tried the ahi tuna sashimi on toast, I was disappointed. The tuna was thinly cut and a little to dry for my preference. The mac and cheese however was pretty good. If it wasn't for the phenomenal Chilean sea bass, I would have rated this 3 stars instead of 4. But the sea bass was a star in itself in my opinion! Lol. The Chilean sea bass was so freaking delicious, it was rich and filling and falling apart nicely on my fork. Finished off my birthday lunch with cake and a pinot noir. Overall nice hidden place this is. If you happen to be in the area, this is a great place to stop and enjoy quality food.",0
3069,6699,"I ordered the lobster thermador.  The relish tray arrived and the veggies were soft instead of crisp though they were raw. Old, not fresh. The cheese bread arrived and was soggy and no flavor. The lobster arrived and looked great, but it was obviously pre-made and just reheated in the microwave. I sent it back to reheat but it still came back lukewarm. The baked potato was also a microwave job. Not really worth the bill for $53.75 without anything to drink but water. Server was sweet and got the order correct. Since I live in Los Angeles it is unlikely I will come here again.",0
3070,6700,Very good restaurant with solid old school fares and ambiance.  (There is still a cigar lounge to the left of the main entrance.)   Peppered steak is the default go-to selection: filet mignon is very tender but I prefer the NY for its extra flavor.  There is such consistency to the flavor and quality of food so that you are rarely let down.  The only gripe I can muster in this regard is that the excellent cheese bread that they give during dinner has been coming out burnt recently.  However they will readily replace with another basket of bread if you ask them.  Other standout dishes are Chilean Seabass Ala Ben and Dal Rae Chopped Salad.  The restaurant is a bit pricy but you can always cut down on the non-essentials to lower your final bill: don't get the ice tea or soda and that will save you about $10 on lunch for 2.,0
3071,6701,Best in continental cuisine and excellent service!Go here when you want to be treated or treat yourself. The scallops were amazing.I only wish my date would have wanted a table side caesar salad or table side bananas foster. Maybe next time! Or with a hungrier date.The best thing about this place? Not a trendy hipster in sight!,1
3072,6702,They have the best peppercorn steak I've eaten in LA but you have to look at the dinner menu the one for the lunch as a smaller portion I was good but I prefer the dinner menu,0
3073,6703,Excellent service. Got seated in a nice booth within 5 min. Wife and I were there with another couple. Going to see a show in Whittier. Long drive from S.F. Valley but worth it. We had the Caesar salad. Made tableside. Good portions. Wife and I had the veal. Very good. Being in the restaurant takes you back to what they used to be 40 years ago. Last time I was there. Walked through the building. Place was packed with people. Would go back to order their specialty.,0
3074,6704,"We had dinner here and this place is impeccable.  It's old fashioned, yet modern.  They did everything to go above and beyond to make us happy.  Delicious doesn't even begin to describe the food here!  The General Manager was polite, checked on us, and even made our Caesar salad and dessert.  It just goes to show that everyone there works as a team...a family...to make the dining experience for the guests memorable.",1
3075,6705,"Friends of ours had been telling us about Del Rae for a long time and we finally had the opportunity to drive there. It is definitely a throwback restaurant and reminds you of the restaurants of the 50s and 60s. Dark, many booths, and a feeling of comfort. I was told at Christmas time it's decorated and beautiful. We ordered the Caesar salad which is supposed to be made at the table except that we were told it was hard to get the cart near our table so it was made in the kitchen. The Cesar salad was good but not terrific. My friend had the beefsteak tomatoes with onions and blue cheese vinaigrette and that was great. One of our friends had the pepper steak and loved it.My husband had the New York steak which he said was quite chewy and tough but I had the best prime rib I have ever had in any restaurant. The server was delightful and we had chocolate  soufflé for dessert which was excellent. It was a crowded restaurant with a DJ in the next room but you could not hear the music at all in the main dining room.it was a fun restaurant, worth the drive.",0
3076,6706,"Had the Chilean sea bass & pepper steak, and it was soooo delicious.The outside of the restaurant had the old Las Vegas look. The inside had aVery old, dark, God father look. Very romantic with dimmed lights all aroundThe restaurant. The service was excellent. Our server was very attentive andCatered to our every need. We enjoyed our anniversary dinner...we will be back!",0
3077,6707,"Well food was good but service was really bad my party and I expected so much more. The lady up front was kind of rude, waiters r too busy.  For a upper class restaurant they seriously need to work on their service!",1
3078,6708,Run don't walk to this old fashioned steak house. It is the best steak for the price that you'll find anywhere. The peppercorn filet is wonderful!!!  Love the special sauce. Also the petite filet is plenty of food!  Don't forget the soufflés. Both the gran marnier and the chocolate are good.  The crudités are a nice touch.,0
3079,6709,"Everything at Dal Rae is fabulous - the food, drinks, service, and ambiance.  The Ahi Toast Points with Avocado and Sea Bass ala Ben are two of my favorites.  I've been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience!  The valet guys are awesome too!",0
3080,6710,First time here celebrating my dad's birthday. Great choice! From the valet to the hosts and our servers were all very sweet. It was a lovely experience with the candle lit dinner + the food was amazing! I asked where the restroom was and then I was escorted. Hehe I would definitely come back!,0
3081,6711,"My boyfriends family used to take us here 20 years ago when we were in High School. I went with my mom a few weeks and the place hasn't changed since I was there last in 1989.PROS- the little things they bring before dinner are good. Good service and quality food. Great place to take clients, especially when your company is picking up the bill.CONS- expensive, my pork chop was just okay compared to the last few restaurants. Needs a remodel/make over inside and out!",0
3082,6712,"We love Dal Rae!!!Their oysters Rockefeller are the greatest, Chilean Sea Bass ala Ben is superb, and their chocolate martinis rule!Their bar service has gone down a lot since the girl bartender left (replaced by a spectacularly obnoxious, short, ""East Coast"" type of dude [hey, some of my best friends are from the East Coast!], so we never sit at the bar anymore). Those ""in the know"" ask for the ""Bar Patio"" seating area when making reservations, go for the food!",0
3083,6713,"Dal Rae is really excellent!Their Oysters Rockefeller is an amazingly perfect taste and texture creation, the best I've had! Their deserts are wonderful, too, but most people go for the steaks, which are memorable. The Chilean Sea bass (which many are not aware is actually Patagonian tooth fish, at any restaurant) is fantastic! A good friend of mine who lives in Thailand about half the time said ""This is the best fish I've ever tasted in my life!"" You get it ""ala Ben"" style, and you be rockin! The decor and vibe is old school horse racing/gambling/Sinatra/50's, and it's a wonderful time travel trip!It's not cheap, and it's worth it. My girlfriend takes me there for my birthday, and I reciprocate - it's perfect! If you try it with an open mind, you'll probably become a repeat guest like us. Oh yeah, the bar is nice, and the drinks are very good too (the chocolate martini is unbelievably tasty!).",0

We wanted to experience the restaurant ambiance and we were willing to make early reservations so that they can accommodate us. Walk in and the Hostess did not smile or even look at us. (Strike 1) Walk us to the back of the restaurant and a sat us down in their ""overflow"" room. (Strike 2). I ask the waitress to move us closer to the restaurant. I was told they were full but offered us the Garden room. (Strike 2  1/2). The Garden room wasn't bad so we stayed.  If it weren't for the delicious food I would have given this place 3 strikes.Would I go back? Maybe.",0
3085,6715,I love this place. Probably one of the best prime rib dinners you can get. Also the employees are super professional.,0
3086,6716,Delray restaurant have very fresh seafood I haven't been there in a long time. But it was always very good excellent service excellent ambience. Love love love their lobster.,1
3087,6717,This is like a year late lol! But went here with the bf and we had a horrible experience so bad we left before we even ordered our food! They took like 20min to sit us and there was a grip of empty seats!! And then when they finally sat us we waited for another 20min just to get a drink order in from the waitress and we waited like 15min for our drinks and still nothing that's when we up and left the place and will never go back!!!,0
3088,6718,"First time visit on 6/27/2017. We came to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary. What an amazing experience!!! The service, food and ambiance was first rate. This is how dining used to be, not the chain restaurant experience you get nowadays. We had Oysters Rockefeller,(try finding that on current restaurant menus!!!), I  had  Lobster Thermador and the hubby had, yes its true, Abalone almondine. I had the best Lemon Drop Martini I've had in ages. We finished up with Grand Marnier soufflé. Have special occasion coming up? This is the place to go, you wont be disappointed!!! They also have beautiful private areas for events.",0
3089,6719,"This place is so delicious!! It's an old school steakhouse with great food and even better service. I am not a fish person, but the sea bass here is the best dish I've ever had.

3090,6720,"I love the Dal Rae, the food is excellent and ambiance is great!  I do have a small complaint, our waitress was not very attentive.  We had to ask for water and bread, flag her down so that we could order a salad.  I made reservations 2 weeks in advance because we were celebrating two birthdays, but our request for a Happy Birthday song was never addressed.  I was so upset!  We love this place and looked forward to this night only to be disappointed.  The food was delicious!!! I want to return for my daughters birthday but I just had to vent about our Saturday night dinner, this past Saturday.  I don't want to get the waitress in trouble because maybe she's new but when you spend the amount of money we did I was disappointed.  Please address this to your staff.

3093,6723,"Dal Rae is one of my favorite restaurants for a quiet steak dinner during the week. Their cut on their Chilean Sea bass is unreal, the Chef really knows how to keep their clientele happy. Expect to pay an average of $70/ea for a decent dinner paired with a glass of wine, this restaurant is well worth it!",0

3095,6725,"Service was very slooow.  Took about 20 mins after we sat down before server asked for drinks, then another 10/20 before order, then prob 1+hr before we got our food.The food (since I'm trying to be disciplined!):  my wilted spinach salad was good -- warm and still a bit of the raw crunch.  Dressing is basic and simple w/ a ""few"" bacon pieces - a vinegrette, but I would call it rather ""boring"" for presentation...also tried the calamari (usual, fried appetizer) but it was rather plain and bland...so unless you're here for a nice slab of meat (steak  & the like), I wouldn't pick this dining spot.  But fellow diners did say entree's/meats were good, but definitely pricey!Atmosphere: feel/vibe of traditional steakhouse, and a piano bar so that's nice...unexpected in Pico Rivera.Price: $$$$Parking: Valet, and it's crowded so expect a bit of a wait.",0
3096,6726,"Recently went to Dal Rae for the first time for my father's 50th birthday dinner. It's a nice almost hidden restaurant on Washington Blvd.It felt like we were pulling into a drive in due to the old school signage. It was nice but the valet felt unnecessary since the lot was small. I appreciated the vintage ambiance once we were inside and I was excited for dinner. The excitement was quickly diminished by the horrible waitress. I didn't think that the old decor would reflect old ways of thinking. Don't get me wrong the hostess,  bus boys, and dessert gentlemen were great but our waitress treated our large group like second class citizens. It took her almost an hour to take our orders, within that would occasionally pop in to ask one person what they would like to drink (literally pop in so no one else could get a word in).  There was no small talk with our table like she had with others, she would scurry away as soon as she could. Yes, my parents have accents but that doesn't mean they can't understand or communicate. If anything she should be an expert at helping people of color because she not only works with them but she works in Pico! Where people of color are the majority, in particular Latin@s.Dal Rae make sure your waitresses aren't stuck in the past and make sure they stop discriminating. Better yet fire them because it shouldn't be something your establishment is associated with.(side note: certain things did occur when it comes to the times the waitress did talk-aka behind our backs but we could hear-but it's too much to explain via yelp.  Also we didn't request a new waitress in fear that they would taint our food)I'm giving 2 stars because the food was good (sea bass,  lobster thermidor, halibut, swordfish, parmesan chicken) and everyone else was friendly. It wouldn't feel right giving it 1 star because of a horrible waitress, it also didn't feel right giving it 3 stars because it was a special occasion and it will not be forgotten.",0
3097,6727,"Pricey, but oh so good.  I love their pepper steak and the lobster thermador.  You have to try their caesar salad - made table side and delicious.  The servers are friendly and extremely attentive.  We are going back next week for their taste of LA preset menu.  Looking forward to it!",0
3098,6728,"Dal Rae is probably my younger daughter and son-in-law's favorite steak restaurant.  The steaks, prime rib and veal chops are very good.  They also have very good Caesar salad as well as cheaper, but in my opinion, a better Wilted Spinach salad.  The desserts that we had were just OK.  There is a $25 corkage fee per bottle if you bring your own wine.  Try and avoid being seated in the back room behind the bar grand piano.  You might have to wait a bit, but it is worth it to be seated in the main dinner room.  Very good service.  Valet parking.",0
3099,6729,"Tonight was our first time here to celebrating our anniversary. We loved everything about this restaurant. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We had Manhattans to drink and they were fabulous. The relish and bread basket provided were good and really tied in the old school vibe. Both of us had the prime rib and baked potato for dinner. Our prime rib was so juicy and full of flavor. The waitress dresses your baked potato table side which adds to the charm of the place. There is also a horse radish cream that comes with the prime rib. I do not like horseradish however , I loved this one. Also, once we were finished with our meal they brought out a slice of chocolate cake. This cake was delicious perfect amount of chocolate without being overly rich. The cake was very moist and even had chocolate curls on top. Thank you Dal Rae for making our anniversary dinner so special. We will definitely be coming back.",0
3100,6730,"I took my fiancé to celebrate his birthday  on a Friday. I had made a reservation so we got seated as soon as we arrived . We were served water and a veggie platter shortly after, we were then provided with our drink menu. It took our server what seemed like about 15 mins to get our drink orders in, once our drinks arrived we ordered. Our food came and it was delicious, we enjoyed their famous pepper steak( highly recommend) ,  garlic mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese for our sides.  Some time In between our dinner  I was asked if I wanted a second drink , which I ordered.  Our plates were cleared and our check was dropped off, our server did not offer any more drinks or dessert. We were celebrating a birthday so I figured we would end with a dessert but the option was never given. What am de the experience worse ,was that the couple next to us had an amazing server, who was making them laugh, offering drinks, dessert and even informed them there was no rush on leaving and to enjoy the night.  Meanwhile our server was not as nice or welcoming . As I stated the food was great but our server just did not make the the night enjoyable. We will not be going back.",0
3101,6731,"Worst service ever!!! Server took 20 minutes to even show up to the table the first time, finally put in a drink order.... Drinks arrived relatively promptly. However, to place our order for food took 30 minutes, and only after we asked another server to please take our order. 25 minutes elapsed after our order had been placed, when the server comes back and says that the item we ordered is not available!!! What? Took you this long to realize??? Very annoying! Then another 35 minutes pass and still no food! Finally asked to speak to a manager and after relating the story above. He just says ""well I don't know what to tell u, we were very busy tonight"" I couldn't believe what I was hearing! Please don't come here! Go to clearmans steak n stein! Excellent service each time!",0
3102,6732,Have been passing by this place for years. We finally made our way there. When you arrive you see a lot of fancy cars but the actual look of the restaurant don't look fancy. When you finally walk in it looks like a classic place where mobsters would meet up and have dinner. There is soo much going on inside decor is old. Food was good not great! It's a bit pricey.,1

3105,6735,"While the food was excellent, the atmosphere of the restaurant diminishes the fine dining experience you would expect for the prices they charge.Hostesses upon arriving were not friendly, not welcoming. Based on first impression, we should have left.  After following hostess to our table, which she found was not ready, we were kept standing in the cramped entry way for at least 15 minutes. No one seemed to be concerned that we had to wait.The dining room is incredibly packed with tables. The room is very loud with other diners and it is nearly impossible to have a conversation at your table. Unfortunately, because the tables are so close in proximity, my family was subjected to the diner next to us, and his use of racial slurs.While tableside preparation of dishes is a nice touch, it is not so nice when diners are forced to get up from their seats, and push their chairs in to make room for the carts.I can sum this up as been there, done that. There are plenty of other fine dining establishments that offer both excellent food, welcoming staff, and a superb atmosphere.",0
3106,6736,"I had a mother-daughter dinner date and the food was wonderful.  The abalone was tender and flavorful while my daughters filet was cooked perfectly.

Overall a wonderful night with my baby girl.",1
3107,6737,So I read so many great reviews about this place and I was extremely disappointed. The food was way too expensive for the quality . The waitress got my order wrong and then had a bad attitude with me because I asked her to take it back. On the bright side The bread was good and also valet/parking were friendly. From the outside the place looks like a hole in the wall but in the inside the atmosphere was very romantic and luxurious,0
3108,6738,"My husband made dinner reservations here for our anniversary. It was my first time there and it was such a great experience. From the moment we pulled up and I saw the retro sign out front I knew I was going to love it! Walked in 30 mins before our reservation on a Saturday night and were able to find a spot at the bar for pre dinner cocktails. The bar area was dark and there was music playing in the background. Met a nice couple and had drinks. We were called to our table right on time. We were seated at a nice corner booth and met our very nice server. She brought us the relish tray and bread basket, and informed us about the specials. I went with the prime rib and garlic mashed potatoes. The husband went with the Duck'le Orange. Our meal came very quickly but not before our waitress brought us some cheese bread. Which was delish! The prime rib was cooked perfectly and the garlic mashed potatoes were to die for. The duck was prepared table side. It was quite a show. The portions were hefty were able to bring some home. We didn't have much room to order their classic desert options but our waitress brought us a piece of wedding cake for our anniversary. From start to finish it was a top notch experience. The ambience is like walking into a 1950s movie. Nice to see people who have most likely been coming here for a long time and truly enjoy themselves. The staff was friendly and on point. Food was flavorful and cooked perfectly. We will definitely be back.",0
3109,6739,"We went here for a family dinner on Christmas Eve. They have a limited menu on special holidays, but they have great selections. Everyone had steak or salmon, everyone enjoyed the food, atmosphere but most of all the great service. It's a bit pricey but a great restaurant for a special occasion.",0
3110,6740,"Been here a few times and have to say the food is pretty good here!  My favorite entree to order is the Chilean Sea Bass, flaky and tasty!   I tried the steaks and they were just OK.  Wasn't what I expected especially after reading all the different reviews on Yelp.   The caesar salad is pretty good too.  From the outside, it doesn't look good.  I thought I was at the wrong restaurant.  It looks pretty ghetto. The service is OK.  Also sucks that you have to Valet park.",1
3111,6741,Great food. My favorite is start with the tibits. Then get the flounder or sea bass. This place is known for stake but trying to be healtjy. And there stake is good don't get me wrong probably the best in town. Also try the bloody Mary.,1
3112,6742,"My wife and I celebrated our 9 month anniversary this past Saturday. We made dinner reservations for 6pm. The food was awesome!! The shrimp scampi was delicious and I highly recommend it. The spacing of the dishes (appetizers, main course, desert) was very good. However, our service was mediocre at best. To start, we were not provided a drink menu and had to request it about 10-15 minutes after we had sat down. Everyone in the dining area appeared to be drinking wine for the most part, but my wife and I were not provided a wine list and requested a bottle of Justin Cabernet to enjoy our meal with. At one point my wife and I went to the bathroom together for about 3 minutes. Upon our return our server said, ""I thought you guys had left."" Implying that we would leave without paying for our meal. She could have simply not said anything or chosen a better way to communicate. To say the least, this did not sit well with us. We continued to enjoy the evening there and will brush it off as a one time incident.",0
3113,6743,"Tonight was my first visit.  First off this place is pretentious for Pico Rivera, but OK it's fine dinning.  Good things - Drinks were awesome!  Complimentary flat bread was a bit burnt - but whatever it's free.  Garlic toast was delish!  They also have us an assortment of veggies that seemed out of place.  We started with the calamari - way over cooked and chewy.  Nancy, our waitress quickly took it off our bill.  My wife and I were celebrating a late Valentine's Day Dinner which was going amazing until some ridiculous host decided to sit a business party of 10 at the table next to us.  For God's sake it's a Monday, I told the waitress why we were there and with ton's of open tables they sit them right next to us. I expressed how unsatisfied I was with the proximity of the large party.  Nancy offered to move us, why should I have to move, We were there first!  No worries I excused myself to the bar, and had a wonderful time with myself and talked with the bartender.  I paid my bill and split the tip with the bartender who was very attentive.  Overall this place is way overpriced with an outdated menu.  I suppose that they could be called ""classics,""  I just think its outdated.  It took me 30 plus years to visit this place in the town I grew up in. I will not be going back any time soon, or maybe ever.Dear Management,If you have the servers take the time to ask ""what the occasion for the visit"" is ( every server asked the question).  They should at least be empowered to do something to ensure that the visit meets that end.  MY GOD, I paid enough for it!",0
3114,6744,"Not the same place it used to be 10, 20, or 30 years ago. The place seems to be trading on its reputation from yesteryear. Today, the food quality is marginal and overpriced. Wait service is overworked and inattentive. If you find yourself in the Pico Rivera area and hungry, this restaurant may be worth considering, but I would not go out of my way to dine here.",0
3115,6745,"The ""Poor Man's Pepper Steak"" is the entrée to get here. I really liked the atmosphere. I will definitely go here again.",1
3116,6746,This place has changed little since the 60s when my Mom would take us there for shrimp vinaigrette. The food is always delicious and the service is always the best.,1
3117,6747,"Fantastic experience .  Sea Bass was excellent, the fillet quality was too of the line. We have been customers for over 25 years.  Sad to see the piano bar turn into a napkin folding station.  We love dining in the Bar, our server was excellent.  Will be back",0
3118,6748,"One of our family fav's!! We have been going here for years!! Get the sashimi on toast; you will not be dissatisfied! Sometimes, we will just go here & order that appetizer, with a lot of cocktails!! Lol! Very classy/modern vibe, and always great service! The tomahawk steak is a great one as well but not on the menu; the regulars will let you in in this little secret! I love the valet and they do not charge extra if you leave your car over night! I always get the crab legs & have yet to find another spot that compared! I hate the hassle if cracking/opening the legs, however, the dal are conveniently cracks & opens them up for you!",0
3119,6749,"Came here for my boyfriend's birthday and we both absolutely loved it!!! The food was amazing and great service. We both ordered steak and they were perfectly seasoned, the mashed potatoes were amazing, but the best of all was their garlic bread!!! You must have that garlic bread when you come here. I definitely will be coming back!",0
3120,6750,"What amazing dinner!  Food excellent, terrific menu and Jennifer was the best food served on the planet!!!  Going back tonight!!!",1
3121,6751,"Cesar salad for two was delicious, but my steak had no flavor, it's like they forgot to add spices. I'd come here again JUST for the salad.",0
3122,6752,"Great ambiance, great feel. Love the Caesar salad prepared table side, amazing! The creamed corn was delicious and the bread.... can't wait to go back!",0
3123,6753,"We had an amazing time. Food was delicious. The steamed clams were out of this world. The Chilean sea bass was fantastic. Michelle, our server was fantastic.",0
3124,6754,"This place is a cultural icon. The food was amazing and service excellent. If you're in the neighborhood and looking for a great steakhouse, this should be on the top of your list!",1
3125,6755,This place is awesome--both fish and meat is to die for.  A taste of old times gone by.  Jared is always welcoming me with a smile and a stiff drink.,1
3126,6756,"Food, as always, spot on.  Pepper filet tender and tasty.  Caesar salad rich and wonderful.  My fault last night was the service.  Our waitress, was nice, but perhaps too many tables or whatever, but once sat, we waited 15 minutes for her come by.  She took our drink orders and we waited another 10 minutes for them to arrive.  When we ordered our dinner, apps took forever.  The Caesar cart was placed in front of us, with the other 2 appetizers just sitting there.  Finally, our Caesar ""maker"" arrived and tossed our salad.  Still a nice evening, but considering 2 of us spent $200, the service needs to be better.",0
3127,6757,"Really enjoy a nice, relaxing dinner here. Tuna toast is a must. Great mix of flavors with or without avocado is always good. Ham & egg sandwich is so good (if you want something different lol) prime rib dip is always a hit as is peppered steak. I tried the poor mans steak, ground angus beef patty omg so good! We typically sit in the bar area unless we're with guests. Our favorite server for years now, Sonia.",0
3128,6758,"Dal Rae is a classic old-skool joint.  Originally opened in 1958 and refurbished in 1999 so that the best of it's past is new again, Dal Rae is classy like The Rat Pack, Marilyn and Gacy.  Drive up on a Saturday night and feel the energy - lots of movement, laughter, and the sounds of good times.  The management and the staff are super-friendly and go out of their way to keep everyone happy.  The food is an array of classic cholesterol, salt, sugar and fat filled joy.  Definitely not for those without the constitution to throw cautuion to the wind in the name of good times.Let's start with what gets placed on the table as you're seated.  Bread baskets - oftentimes plural, then then garlic bread, and oftentimes garlic toast as well.  On the house, like you used to date the owner's ugly cousin in the old neighborhood and he still owes you.  Oh yeah - ther's also a classic relish tray.  No screwing around here, and we haven't even gotten down to business.  For an appetizer?  Fresh Oysters on the Half Shell, Alaskan King Crab claws on Ice, Marinated Alaskan King Crab Claws, Oysters Rockefeller, a pot of Steamed Little-Neck Clams, Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail, Fried Calamari, Fried Rock Shrimp, Shrimp Scampi, Baked Scallops Cava de Oro, Crab Cakes, Cajun Shrimp with Spinach, Ahi Sashimi on Toast, Spicy Salmon Tartar, or perhaps Oscietra Caviar?  That's just the seafood.  You get the idea.  The salads are consistently good, and I usually prefer the Cesar, prepared tableside.  On to the main course.  All ingredients are top notch, and prepared with love and integrity.  Let's skip the pedestrian crap and go with the basics.   The Lobster Thermidor - who else still does this?  My favorite, whenever I'm feeling a butter deficiency.  The 20oz Giant Broiled Australian Lobster Tail always catches my eye and looks great on the table next to me, but for $98 I usually pass - I'll wait until that next trip to Mexico.  The portions of fish are a monument to Neptune himself - parmesan crusted sea bass, macadamia nut crusted halibut, herb crusted swordfish - not so much about the main ingredient (the fish, stupid), but rather proper seasonings, texture and taste - and it's good, really good.  Poultry?  I scoff at anyone who would order poultry in a steak house like this - if you do, then you're a total loser, doomed to a life of misery.  Veal, oh, the veal - a restaurant that actually knows how to properly prepare slaughtered baby cow so that is can be consumed with the gusto a trip to hell properly deserves - another one of my faves.  If you do beef I can vouch for the pepper steak and the steak Diane, prepared tableside.  When considering the other white meat, my friend Liza says that the pork chops are fantastic as well.Dessert, oh yes.  While I usually pass, this cannot be missed - do what you have to - no judgment here.  Cherries Jubilee, prepared tableside is an ode to the days when cigarettes were good for you and speed was legal.  My favorite is the bananas flambe, also known as bananas Foster, prepared tableside - absolutely divine, the best in Los Angeles.  The best steakhouse in LA?  Hardly.  The best atmosphere?  Nope.  What it is, is a place for special evenings with your best dame or guy.  A place where you can go and have fun and be loud and get treated like the kings and queens you are, with no thought to healthy eating, bad service or the troubles of the world - only enjoying yourself in the moment with all the gusto of a Sinatra Song - how sweet it is.",1
3129,6759,"I had the french dip and my client had a chop salad. Both were great! Very attentive service. I hear that at night the place is really great! I look forward to checking that out. If you like the old Rat Pack style steak house and cigar bar (without the stogies), give them try. I think you will like it.",1
3130,6760,The Dal Rae is a great restaurant! I go there with family and friends for special occasions. The pepper steak and the Chilean sea bass are amazing! The service is great too!,1
3131,6761,"Ok people, YES, I do get out of the city of Whittier once in a while. More like half of the year.  It was a Saturday night and I was in the mood to grab a few drinks.  My first thought was that I wanted to go to a classy & intimate place where they also had live music.  Del Rae it is!  I was in great company and as soon as we arrived, the mood was set just right.  The head bar tender is a mixologist when it comes to making the most creative drinks.  That kicked off the night.  Then they usually have two types of entertainers on the piano.  The girl that performs is a little more jazzy with the blues.  The guy who performs is a little more soulful and sings a lot of Motown and R&B.  Either way, they will get you dancing, or at least they always get me dancing.  Then came that whiff in the air, ""menu please.""  Started off with the Oysters Rockefeller which are loaded with spinach, bacon, pernod, hollandaise sauce, & parmesan. Talking about a screaming orgasm, ""yummy"" (high pitched voice).  That was followed by the delish ahi sashimi on toast.  This night, we did not order a salad, but if you must, the caesar salad is my fav.  Usually, one of the owners tosses the salad for you at your table, so cool.  Then came the grand prize, the Dal Rae Famous Pepper Steak.  You have two choices with this and you can't go wrong either way, a filet mignon or a prime new york.  Now do they have plenty of more to choose from on the menu and everything will satisfy all your cravings.  The service is top rated from when you arrive with valet parking to the best servers in the industry. I highly recommend to visit Del Rae once in a while.  Best time to go is either during DineLA week which is this week or during the holiday when they have specials.  Huge savings means more money for more food & drinks.  Enjoy!",0
3132,6762,classic place to eat and it has been here forever..food is outstanding  ....very old school rat pack inside a very good fella's vibe..love that! but really come for the food..on certain nights they have live music and it does get packed..YOU must make a reservation.YOU can eat in the bar but better to eat in the dinning room. You will have a great meal in a fun atmosphere.I have eaten here many times and it is always great! a great date place. sorry no pics my camera on my cell wasnt working...next time I come here I will get some good pics to post...if my uncle sal and cousin vinnie let me...lol you know those good fella's dont like the camera..lol,1
3133,6763,"It took them over an hour to bring the food to the table. After having the food, we kept waiting for the server for at least another 30 minutes and when nobody showed up, I had to walk to the manger and he wasn't even helpful!",0
3134,6764,"boyfriend: ""I'm taking you out to a classy fancy dinner, so where something nice...""me:  ""where is it at?""boyfriend: ""Pico Rivera""me: ""hahaha... yea right""boyfriend: ""i'm serious, its suppose to be nice.""well yeah, you are driving down Washington blvd in pico rivera... pass the dirty Walmart they have there, pass the king taco... and there you see it... A neon green sign ""Del Rae"" and once you pull up to valet you notice all the Rolls Royce cars, Mercedes, Jags... blah, definitely not Pico Rivera!This place serves great food. And they have the best desserts! A must!Very elegant and romantic too.",1
3135,6765,This by far is my wife's favorite restaurant. The peppered steak is the best. The Caesar salad is hand made not your store bought type dressing so it taste so good. The building itself is a little retro and dark but the food helps you overlook those minor flaws.,0
3136,6766,"Honestly, I did not like this place one bit. As a matter of fact, I despised it. Made a reservation at 9pm and didn't get seated until 10pm. After we sat down, it took 35 mins for our server to come to us. It took them AN HOUR to bring us our salads and entrees all at once. The peppered steak was drenched in pepper that it made it really hard to enjoy. The food was too overpriced for its quality. After my date and I both took a bite out of our food, we asked for boxes because we just wanted to get out. We were already really pissed off. I don't recommend this place.",0
3137,6767,"NEVER AGAIN!  Probably one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had - based on the service, attitude of the reservation hostess and overall experience (not the food, which was average for a top-end establishment).  Took my sweetie here on Valentine's Day for her birthday (same day!) - what a mistake.  I knew it would be crowded, so I made reservations in early January.  The woman who answered the phone to take the reservation was rude at that time, so I should have known better.  BUT, having heard positive things about the restaurant I was hopeful it would be a nice dinner experience.  Boy, were we disappointed!  Arrived early at 6pm for a 7pm reservation, expecting to relax and have a cocktail before dinner.  Upon arriving I checked in, and the reservation hostess had an attitude right away.  I asked to be seated in the main dining room, and she snapped ""it's gonna take longer."" At 7pm the dining room hostess (who was very nice) came to seat us and she led us into the more casual side dining room.  I explained to her that we had arrived an hour early and I had requested the main dining room, and she said she would handle it and speak to the reservation hostess. Over the next hour we checked in with the dining room hostess several times, but supposedly she still couldn't seat us...all the while, we watched plenty of other couples who had arrived AFTER us being seated in the main dining room!  Finally, at 7:45, just as we were about to give up altogether and leave the dining room hostess said she would ""sneak us in.""  We were finally seated in the main dining room, and TWO AND A HALF HOURS LATER we concluded dinner.Now, I understand Valentine's Day is a busy day...wouldn't you think the restaurant's management would be prepared for that?  The reservation hostess' attitude was completely unacceptable - I felt she was punishing us for daring to ask to sit in the main dining room, and it appeared the dining room hostess couldn't get her to budge either.  Seems like unless you are a familiar face to the staff or a regular customer, you are treated like a second-class visitor.  Our waitress was very nice, but the service was ridiculously slow.  The special menu was limited - which was fine, but why should the kitchen take so long with a limited menu?  The food was good, but wasn't served hot.  Sadly, dinner was nothing special for a supposed top-end steakhouse.  At the end of the evening, dinner and drinks for two totaled just under $300.  For that kind of money, one should expect great customer service at the very least.  I'm not that hard to please and I rarely post reviews, but I can't ignore last night's horrible experience and can't stress enough how disappointed I am in the Dal Rae.  My advice is, if you are looking for a special date or dinner experience, take your business somewhere else where you might be appreciated.",0
3138,6768,"You won't find a more consistently great restaurant anywhere. The Dal Rae opened in 1958. I have never had a bad meal or been disappointed, Beats Mortons, Flemmings, Maestros, and Ruth's Chris hands down",1
3139,6769,"Best food, best music, my favorite place to come on the weekends, little bit pricey, but everything is so great",1
3140,6770,"I ate at the Dal Rae Restaurant in Pico Rivera, CA on 10/30/2014.  I've been there several times before.  This time I ate there prior to seeing a football game at nearby El Rancho High.  I had the medallions of filet mignon dinner ($29.75) and iced tea ($3.75).  Many of their steak dinners are more expensive but for those wishing to pay less I recommend their pasta dishes.  My server, Christina, did a fine job as well.  No photos as my camera failed me.",0

The ares is a bit dark, but their is valet parking and the food makes it all of.  My parents love the Steak Diane and even though I'm not a beef person, the teryaki tid bits are to die for!",0
3143,6773,"This is the kind of place that can, if you're in the right mood, transport you back to a place and time that never really existed, where all your troubles vanish and everything is amazing.  I've only been here during the holiday season, when they really go all out and there are twinkly little lights everywhere.  It's that kind of place. Get a martini and the pepper steak and whatever else you want.  But do get the pepper steak.   Service is great and the food is classic and delicious.",0
3144,6774,"Dal Rae has some pretty good steaks at reasonably high prices which I much rather get somewhere else.  I hate to say these steaks are bad because obviously they are not but if I had a choice between Dal Rae and Morton's, I'd much rather choose the latter.  For one, Dal Rae's green onion, ham topping on their pepper steak was extremely overpowering and more of an obstruction than anything to the natural taste of the steak.  Tasting the peppered steak but itself revealed a very tender and nicely cooked piece of filet however.  Sides are normal, nothing really stood out on my visit.  I much prefer Mortons, Craft Steak.. etc for the same price.",0
3145,6775,"I was very surprised to find this place in Pico Rivera. My bf and I always go to either Anaheim or Beverly Hills area whenever we want to splurge on a fancy dinner.Took my bf here last week for his birthday. We were seated at a nice, comfy, spacious booth which I appreciated since we are a chunky pair and we need all the arm room we can get to be able to eat without bumping elbows while we devour our food.I had the oysters rockefeller to start. I liked it, but I think next time I'll ask them to go easy on the bacon. It overpowered the oysters a bit in my opinion. The baked scallops were cooked to perfection. I tried a piece of my bf's peppersteak - it was good. I really enjoyed my prime rib! It's been a while since I had a really good prime rib. I used to love Lawry's but the last two times that we were there, I was disappointed,Will definitely come back here. BF wants to order the prime rib for himself next time.And oh, the staff was really great!",1
3146,6776,"This place was delicious.  This was our first time coming here with family to celebrate my birthday.  I am glad we made reservations, because this place fills up fast.  They had live entertainment after 7pm which was a nice touch.  I ordered the surf n turf, which was a peppered Filet Mignon accompanied with Chilean sea bass.  My sides were asparagus and a baked potato.  We had ordered a couple of Caesar Salads to split between 5 of us, and they were prepared table side.  One of the best Caesar salads I have ever had.  The ambiance was great, and the owner himself came by our table to make sure everything was okay.  There really aren't many places around like this one anymore.  I will definitely be returning here in the future.",0
3147,6777,"Love the Dal Rae and it's worth the drive from Pasadena.  The feeling when you first drive up and see the Neon sign and then upon entering you would think the Ratpack would be sitting by the bar!   Do Sit at the Bar close to the piano and on some given nights you will hear a tunes that will take you back in time. Start with any of their Salad appetizers that they make in front of you at your table my favorite is the spinach salad.  My favorite dish,  Chilean Sea Bass with Garlic mashed potatoes and their version of the cosmopolitan made by Barry one of the bartenders. Most of their dishes can be shared, nice portion size.",1
3148,6778,"I love love love this restaurant. My dad took me here a few years ago after my grandma passed away, and told me that the Dal Rae is where she used to take him when he was a kid. My dad is 59 years old. I don't think that the Dal Rae has changed a THING since then! It is super retro - very dark, very old school elegant. I was instantly in love! The food was fabulous, albeit quite expensive. I have been back about 5 times since then. Each visit is a treat (you HAVE to valet park, which just makes you feel important before you even step a foot into the place)... and i want badly to give the Dal Rae a 5 star rating, but... I cannot. And this is due to the (sometimes) terrible service.My first visit, with my dad, was exceptional. Great service, great food, great ambience, great great great...I then had to show my boyfriend how amazing the place was, and we went on a fancy date... it was magic.The third visit was with my brother, my boyfriend and myself. Very good. Especially because my brother paid. Magic.For the fourth visit, I was full of excitement because my friend from Sacramento was visiting and I wanted to show her an extra special time... naturally, I made the Dal Rae part of our plans. We had put down quite a few cocktails before we arrived, and my perfectly fabulous boyfriend drove our drunk butts to the restaurant and paid for all of the food as well. SHOULD have been magic, right? But it wasn't! The food was fabulous, as it always is. I mean, who doesn't love a relish tray on crushed ice brought to your table with an assortment of breads? Relish tray! Yes! However, our server, whose name we did not know until just last night, was markedly terrible. I wasn't so bothered by her at the time, being sloshy and giddy and all, but I was aware that she was either completely absent (like, 'did she just leave the building for the night?' absent), or awkwardly present (like ""can you stop inserting yourself into our conversations and giving us your life story, lady?'). Really. She would spend 5-10 minutes at a time talking to us about her life. I love friendly people... but this was ""weird"" friendly ... like when you're sitting on an airplane and get stuck with the lady to your right who has mistaken you for her therapist. It was like that. The food came out late. The bill would have never come if we hadn't begged for it. However, I put the experience out of my mind.Last night was nearly unbearable though... My boyfriend and I decided to go out for a hot date rather than give each other Christmas presents this year. Naturally, the date would take place at the Dal Rae. I wore a dress. He wore cologne. It meant something, you know? The moment we were seated and saw our waitress, we knew it wasn't going to be a good night. It was HER. I feel very guilty about writing her name, but I feel that people should be aware. The food is too expensive and it's too nice of a place to not warn you all. Her name is Jenn. So it's out there... do with this information what you will.We probably waited 15 minutes before anyone (Jenn) came to our table to even bring us bread/relish tray. We instantly ordered a Caesar salad (for 2)... it was made by somebody else and came promptly to the table (thank you, somebody else). We had also sat down to the table with drinks from the bar, which was very smart of us, as we might not have gotten drinks at all... We had the good sense to order our food at the same time we ordered the salad, though there was no reason to do this. We ate our salad.... and ate our salad, and looked at our salad plates, and looked at our salad plates, and nursed our drinks, and nibbled on radishes and bread.... for 15 minutes, then 20 minutes, and then Jenn would come over and say 'everything is good?' and run off, and then 30 minutes, and then 40 minutes, and she is nowhere in sight, and then suddenly shows up after 45 minutes and says ""everything is good?"" and I say ""Uhhhh, no. ???? Where is our food? We are starving?"", to which she replies ""Oh! Well, you guys got the salad, and so, I just wanted to wait to put in the order."" WHAT???? You wait for 45 minutes to put in our order???? We were sat at 8:15 and it was now 9:15 and she hadn't even put in our order!!!! When the food finally arrived, she frantically asked us if we were here for a birthday. What? We said ""no."" She scuttled away frantically. My Chilean sea bass was incredible, but my boyfriend's 'medium' flat iron steak was VERY RARE. However, we were so hungry that we knew we couldn't send anything back without waiting another HOUR! We ate and laughed and tried to ignore the HORRID service. We finished our food and decided it was time to go, so we waited for the check.... and waited.... and waited... and waited.... until my boyfriend literally had to get up after about 30 more minutes and FIND our waitress, Jenn, to ask for the check. When she brought it to the table she asked again ""Oh, is there a birthday here??"".... WTF?????",1
3149,6779,"Nothing to write home about - You want a better rib eye steak at the same price? Go to Flemings.   But mainly I am writing this review because when I went to use the bathroom after I was already finished eating,  I noticed ice dumped in every single urinal.  While you can Google this topic: ""ice in urinals"" and a lot of links will appear giving you the reasons some bars and restaurants do this.  It is nonetheless disgusting and unappetizing.  Use your logic people.  Unless you have one way buckets or pitchers or whatever method they use to transport the ice from the ice machine to the urinals - there's always going to be CROSS CONTAMINATION.  (one way meaning you use a brand new pitcher or bucket and dig it in the ice, then go to the urinals and pour the ice in the urinals and then throw away the bucket or pitcher) - I highly doubt that this is what occurs - but that would be the only way you would not get cross contamination.  SO DISGUSTING.",1
3150,6780,"If you're like me you probably live nowhere near this establishment.  However let me tell you now that it is definitely worth the drive.Dal Rae is a classic steak house that looks like it was ripped from the television show ""Mad Men.""  It oozes that old school class and quality service from the moment you walk in.  At first when looking over the menu you may get a bit of sticker shock, but at the end of the night I'm sure you will think the final bill worth it.I went on the recommendation of a friend and she advised me on a couple dishes to get.  If this is your first time, you should get the Pepper Steak.  The best steak I've had in Los Angeles without a doubt and you should pair it with the ""Loaded"" baked potato (I mean you're at a steak house so you shouldn't be thinking too much about your health).The steak was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and the weight of the knife cut through the tender meat like butter.  Paired with their house red wine, it created a spiritual eating experience.  Even if you don't finish the plate it makes an excellent steak sandwich for lunch the following day.I finished the night off with the gold brick sundae.  Again...  Wow.  Delcious.  The dipped ice cream sits in a lace cookie bed that is divine.The only complaints I had about the night was we were a party of 4 and the booth we were sat in seemed a bit to snug and the lighting was a bit to bright.  While the calamari I had for an appetizer wasn't bad, I wouldn't suggest it especially since I looked over the menu again and saw many other things that I would've rather tried.Other than that, service was exceptional, Valet parking was great (and not expensive) and I'm already planning a return visit.",0
3151,6781,I had reservations for Valentines Day. We checked in and it took over an hour to be seated. Unfortunately we all were very disappointed with the food. It was as if it was mas-produced for the evening. I had previously had dinner there on a regular day so I know there was a big difference this evening and money was all it was about. My bill was over $600 for 4 people and it was not worth it at all.,1
3152,6782,"We came here to celebrate Chinese New Year at an American steakhouse in Pico Rivera.  How's that for diversity?  It was a DineLA prix fixe dinner, and I've been wanting to try their pepper steak for a long time.  I have to say the service is excellent.  The waitress is attentive and friendly; the refills come without asking; and the courses are nicely, if a little slowly,  paced.   I expected a more retro interior, but it was comfortably modern.  The booths have nicely tufted vinly that give you a comfortable cushioned back and seat.  And, a nice touch was we were placed in the best corner of the restaurant!  I would give a four for the restaurant appointments and a four and a half for the service.Now, onto the food.  It was disappointing.  We ooh and aahh at the showmanship of the flaming duck and baked potato served tableside and the vegetable on ice plate was a nice touch.  After that, it didn't live up to expectations.  The garlic bread was too oily.  The duck was a little dry and a little sweet from the sauce.  The much raved pepper steak was tender, but had little flavor other than being slightly livery.  The steak's charcoaled strips imparted a bitter note to the taste.  My wife commented that the steak probably had been frozen a while to be so devoid of flavor.  Even the pepper sauce had little flavor.  One of our young Chinese diners left 3/4 of the steak uneaten, politely horrified by what Americans pass as steak.  The desserts did help our dinner.  The ice cream brick sundae was nicely presented, but it was after all ice cream.  The creme brulee was tiny, but it tasted fine, not too sweet.  The tiramisu was good, but I'm not much of a tiramisu fan.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience of going to this throwback restaurant, but I think I really arrived here on a bad day for them.",0
3153,6783,"This place is a through back, food is great, prices are a little high.  I love the salad they make for you at the side of your table.  The salmon is my favorite",0
3154,6784,Not what it used to be. Same rude Julie and arrogant Richard. Food was mediocre at best. Last time from a 20+ year diner. They should try 555 to learn something about food and SERVICE!!!,1
3155,6785,"This is the 3rd and probably the last time I have eaten at this restaurant.  Each visit was a solid 6-8 months apart - so I feel confident at giving this review.  DONT BOTHER.  Yes, its a 'decent' place to go and gives you lots of atmosphere, considering the area... but really... the food is over priced and generally tastes bad.  Today I had the ""chicken with WILD mushrooms"" - which consisted of a chicken breast smothered in BEARNAISE sauce (who puts Bearnaise on chicken!!!???) and regular white button mushrooms.  All for $15 or $16. Bleechhh....",0
3156,6786,"My boss and I went there last year to scope it out for our office xmas party.  The food was awesome!!  However, when we went back for the actual party, they had a pared down menu and the items available werent very good.  Im willing to go back - as long as there is the full menu to choose from",0
3157,6787,"Just finished eating lunch at the Dal Rae.  What a huge disappointment!  We will never go back.  This restaurant's quality has gone down tremendously.  This is not the restaurant it used to be.  We ordered the mushrooms with stuffed crab.  The mushrooms we tough.  The bread was stale and dry. The artichoke with lemon sauce was burnt, oily, and tastless.  The sand dabs were a joke.  All batter, no fish and flavorless. The pepper steak which is their speciality was not up to par.Way over priced and you could get better food and service at a local cafe.Shame on you Dal Rae, as you have really disppointed some of your loyal followers.",0
3158,6788,THE BEST steak and seafood around! I love eating there. The pepper steak is to die for. and there prime rib is like eating a half a cow. It's huge. There seafood couldn't be any fresher. Whenever i go i make reservations other wise it's a long wait.,1
3159,6789,"First let me say the food here is great, hands down some of the best food I have ever had. The 1 star is for the service. The last two times I have been here we had the worst service. I thought it was a fluke the first time and wrote it off as an off day but we returned recently and it took 55 minites to get the appetizers an another hour and ten minutes to get the main course. They say good food is worth the wait but two hours and ten minutes is too long for me, I won't be back!",0
3160,6790,"Cool and copacetic, the Dal Rae creates a relaxed atmosphere amid all the bustling action.  I imagine this place was once filled with smoke and decked out cats looking fab.A Rat Pack feel and Kerouac vibe, the Dal Rae certainly delivers on its comfortable feel.  The entry to the left, houses the bar area of the DR.  Nice layout to have some intimate conversation or view the basketball game.  This bar is truly old school in that the drinks will make you second guess who's driving.  That guy sporting the jelly roll made me second guess the decade as well.Once seated, the servers don't swoop in like vultures.  Drinks will be refreshed and the menus can be perused at your leisure.I'm not really sure if there is a way to swing and miss on what you order at the Dal Rae.  Everything I've tried has been spectacular.  If you're not a huge fan of something, don't order it.  I am especially fond of the halibut and the Veal Oscar.  The basket of bread and the veggie plates are a nice warm-up before your entrees arrive.The Dal Rae's location however, is less than desirable as it's sandwiched into the area of nothing else to do.  If there was some action surrounding the Dal Rae, I'd imagine this place to be hopping at all times.  While location won't prevent me from going back to the Dal Rae, I imagine it will limit how often I frequent the establishment while visiting or working in LA.Try:  The halibut (regardless of what they're crusting it in)Avoid:  Leaving a bag of pork chops from the grocery store in the back seat of the car for the valets to encounter (so that's what the smell was)",1
3161,6791,"pico rivera. isn't that area known for..... crime? not steak?i took my date here last week since she only lives ten minutes away. it was her first time, as was mine. the decor of this place is soooo cool! themed from the 50's!! i had the pepper steak filet mignon and it was AWESOMEEEEE!!!i just had fleming's last night, and this place is better (imho)so yeah, my date was equally excited about this place! brownie points for me and props to you yelpers out there!! we'll be back! hahaha",1
3162,6792,"If you're looking for delicious seafood and steaks, this is the right place!  Their filet mignon is delicious and their appetizers are amazing!  I'm personally a fan of their escargot and their cheesy garlic bread.  The service is great too!  And if you have room in your stomach for more, their desserts are quite tasty!  This is the place for special occasions, or if you feel like having really good food!",1
3163,6793,"Where have I been??? Being originally a local girl, I can't believe it was just my first visit. We visited on a Sunday evening and placed our reservations on OpenTable. I highly recommend you come hungry for that special celebration. The ambiance gives you that old Hollywood charm with the dim lights, white table cloths, and cozy booths. We started off with stuffed mushrooms with crab. It was a great move on our server to proactively split the app prior to serving. Also, if you have a salad choose a made at your table Caesar accompanied by the most amazing but naughty garlic cheese bread. Some of us ordered steak, prime rib, seabass and scallops. All were amazing and cooked with craft. We somehow followed with dessert and coffee. Bravo to the folks keeping this place classy. I think Frank Sinatra would have given this place a thumbs up too.",0
3164,6794,"We have been coming here many years! It's our go to steak house but surprisingly my favorite thing on the mine is the Chilean sea bass ... It melts in your mouth! It's a great place to go with friends, family and even for a work function. I've done them all trust me... Everyone you take there will be pleased. They also have an amazing bread pudding.",0
3165,6795,I don't think these people are talking about the same restaurant??? I've been coming to this place for almost 20 years and everything has always been perfect. The food is beyond excellent. The STEAK DIANE is a  must try!!,1
3166,6796,It does not get better than the Dal Rae Restaurant for steak and seafood.  I have traveled the world and the Dal Rae lobster is the best  (large & Fresh) as is their Fillet Pepper Steak and Steak Diane.,0
3167,6797,"Props to my old college roommate for showing me this killer old-school steak joint.  I surely would never have known about this place without him dragging me to pico rivera one night.  The result is a secret spot to take friends and dates to have an awesome steak or lobster (yes, lobster, it's really good here) dinner.  They got a full bar and the wine list is pretty good.  Service rocks and very friendly, ask em anything about the menu.  For dessert, the cherries jubilee is sorta gimmicky but u gotta order it for first timers.  I'm glad there are places like this that have survived the test of time and kept the retro vibe...make a reservation if you go!",0
3168,6798,"Don't waste your money.  It is extreamly overpriced and the food is only average.  The Prime Rib was difficult to cut with a steak knife and not much flavor.  They are living on their reputation from 40 years ago.  If you want an expensive time warp, this is the place to go.",0
3169,6799,"We came here for the first time for a birthday celebration.  It was a Saturday night so, as expected, it was really crowded.  If I was rating just on food I would give 5 stars.  Excellent steaks...probably up there with the best I've had.  But the service was mediocre and there were mistakes with our orders.  It took almost a hour to get our food and that was really disappointing and hard to overlook, even with how busy they were.  I would never go back on a weekend evening, but would return for the food midweek, early dinner time.",0
3170,6800,Very disappointed in the Del Rae!!We made reservations to celebrate our 36th wedding anniversary  on Saturday night. When we arrived they seated us at a large booth promptly.  The table was set for four people.  When we inquired if another couple was going to be seated at the same booth they said yes.  We asked to be reseated at another booth and the not so pleasant hostess said all the empty booths were already reserved .. This is at  5;30 pm.  There were plenty of empty booths.  I don't plan on spending almost 200 dollars on a dinner and have to share a table.  Went to another resturant and had a lovely dinner!  Caution when you make a reservation ay Del Rae specify the table!!,0
3171,6801,"I just adore this place.Sure, it's a trip from out in the west SFV where we live, but leaving ""LA"" it actually adds to the experience.I love the veggie tray, the garlic bread, and the very generous pours from the bar. Very nice touches.Our apps were terrific (baked scallops, artichoke bottoms, brie, tomato/onion salad) and the waitress plated them separately for us (6 in the party) without asking, which I found very thoughtful.I always get fish of some sort, this time the sand dabs alla Ben. Fantastically prepared and the fish was fresh tasting. My wife's halibut was awesome according to her. Others in our party got steak and one got veal. No doggie bags...speaks volumes.The experience there is what makes it, in my opinion. Service is professional and prompt and thankfully (to me) does without the semi-phony bon homme of, some of the pricy chain steakhouses. Prices, though high, don't approach, say, Mastro's territory by a longshot, and the menu doesn't force the ala carte thing (my fish came with a nice baked potato and grilled asparagus).A nice touch: you can actually have a pleasant, normal conversation in this place no mater the crowd. I credit the cork tiles on the ceiling.",0
3172,6802,"Oh Del Rae, let me count the ways, in how you enrich my drabe existance every time I venture thru those old ass green doors, into a world of dark, and old decor.. You gotta love it.Been here a couples times. Love this place. Usually go at lunch,  and you can always get a seat or table, but if coming with a group, its highly recommended you get a reservation.  So we valet, which everyone must, walk in, and get seated. Mind you its December, and they've decorated this joint beautifully. I was so taken in aw when i walked in... Too bad I didnt bring my phone, I would of gotten some nice pics. But yes, its all in Holiday cheer, with trees, and lights a plenty.So we sit, and promptly get waited on.  We have water put on our table as well as a bread basket. Waitress was very attentive. She recommended some appetizers, and we gladly accepted.We end up getting there Teriyaki Tenderloin tips, and the baked mushrooms stuffed with crab...MMMMMMmmmm.. Both were excellent.For lunch, I had there peppered Filet Mignon, which came with mashed potatoes, and green beans.  Everything was prepared very well. I asked for medium rare, and I got medium rare.  Good steak joint, and there fish is acually really good as well.No dessert, but looking over at the other tables who did, man, do they look good....Overall, if you havent been, you got to try. A little pricey, but well worth it.  Also this place looks like a bowling alley from the outside during the day, so if you never been, and are looking for it, now you know.",1
3173,6803,Steak steak steak steak steak... Mmmm. Expensive but so worth the amazing taste. All of their sides are equally as good. I also love the old school Frank Sinatra-esque vibes. Fancy right in the middle of the neighborhood. It's a great place.,1
3174,6804,"Last night my husband and I went to Del Rae to celebrate Valentine's,a day early. It was our first time at Del Rae therefore we were both excited since we love trying out new places, especially when reviews are great. We arrived at Del Rae at 9:20pm early since our reservation was at 9:30pm. We were asked if we wanted to sit at a table near the bar or in a booth and since it was too loud at the bar we said at a booth but we were told it was going to be 30 minutes but the table at the bar was ready. I was confused because I made reservations therefore my table should be ready for me I should not have to wait additional time for a table. We were given a pager and had to wait standing next to the fireplace since there is no waiting area. While we were waiting within less than 5 minutes of us arriving a waiter stormed out of the restaurant slamming the front door so hard that he broke it. If we would have been 5 minutes earlier than he would have hit us with the door. This was very scary because we did not know what had happened and if he was going to return to the restaurant and go postal. Then all of a sudden our booth was ready no need to wait for 30 minutes but I am sure it was because of the incident otherwise we would have not been seated until 10pm, ridiculous. We shared a booth with another couple who were really nice but it turned out that the waiter that walked out and broke the door was their waiter. The waiter we got was nice but he was so very busy that we did not see him that often only to get our order and bring our food.I gave 2 stars because the food was good but the experience for a place that has been in the business for many years was horrible. Word of caution, do not go to Del Rae for any big holidays. You would think that they would be prepared to handle the madness but they were not able to handle a Saturday late night Valentine's weekend. I can only imagine how is going to be Sunday Valentine's Day. The menu was a set menu with salad or soup, entree, and dessert for $80 per person. Well my husband and I wanted the soup since it was Clam Chowder but after an hour of the waiter taking our order he told us there was no more Clam Chowder only ceaser salad which was what we ate, there was no other choice.The service was very slow we were at Del Rae for more than 3 hours and it was not by choice but rather because of the slow service. For the price we paid for all we ate it was very disappointing. I do not know if I will give Del Rae another chance. I may return on a day that it's not so busy but if I do it will not be any time soon. I will not be recommending Del Rae to any of my close friends or family. My Valentine's dinner was not what I would have wanted it to have been. My husband and I should have gone to The Habit down the street instead.",0
3175,6805,"Ok where to start. So have been hearing about this place from my friend for some time. So we decided to go on the 22nd of september for their awesome prime rib dinner for only about 25 bucks. With this deal, i was super excited to come and try this place, because they normally charge around 50 bucks per meal.anyway, my friend did warn me about the service. I went in thinking it cant be THAT bad...boy was i wrong. We had set a reservation for 8:30, however, we did not get seated for almost an hour later. although i know they were busy, there was no need for us to wait an hour. An upside, during that hour wait we spent our time at the bar, which was pleasant. The prices on drinks were pretty high almost 9 bucks for a gin and tonic..what?!We were eventually called to our table only after we had complained to the bartender about how long we had been waiting. Not to mention, i had gone up to the front desk twice before that to see about the wait.The thing that really ticked me off about this place was that when we were seated, we took a quick look around and there had to be at least 7 booths the size of ours completely empty. What was the hour wait for? i kept asking. terrible.I have nothing bad to say about the food, it was pretty delicious. We were supposed to be getting a smaller piece of meat, but because i think they saw our distraught faces, they brought us a full meat with bone included for no extra charge.Ive definitely had better meant, but for the sake of leaving something positive about this place, it was passable. the check ended up coming out to somewhere around 100 bucks. we had gotten a 38 dollar wine. 2 stars.oh and apparently the Armenian mafia runs this place, which kind of creeps me out, but that's neither here nor there.",0
3176,6806,Absolutely outstanding!  This is an old school restaurant serving a relish tray and garlic bread before your meal. The service is excellent. Everything was delicious and cooked perfectly but we especially enjoyed the grilled artichoke appetizer and the pepper steak. Great place for a special occasion,0
3177,6807,"First time impressions, Busy place at 6:30 on a Saturday evening but starting emptying out around 8:30.    It's expensive, I enjoyed the pepper steak and 2 vodka martinis which were excellent.  My wife had an amazing Old Fashioned that was poured perfectly.   I ordered the mashed potatoes on the server's recommendation.  They were excellent!   Honestly, no one at our table spent the extra money on Soup or Salad,  just order the mains and you will love the food!!",0
3178,6808,"On Dec. 10th. My friends and I went to the. Dal Rae in Pico Rivera. The food was excellent, as was the service. the problem was that there were too many people for the size of the room! The servers had difficulties maneuvering around the tables. The man in a booth behind one of my friends, asked her to move forward; because he was being bumped by the server. She had no where to go! It was noisy, had there been a fire, many people could have been injured. It is all on management, no way is it the fault of the employees! Juliet G.",0
3179,6809,Veal Chop and Garlic cheese bread!!!!  Love it!!!!,1
3180,6810,This was me and my girl first time and we loved awesome food great service. I recommend trying the Prime Rib.,1
3181,6811,"This is probably one of the best quality restaurants I have been to in quite some time. Great customer service. I ordered the orange chicken and it was prepared right at the table! I literally wish I could eat more food... this place was grand! Great drinks and nightly specials! Great place for a first date, most people dress up! YAY!",0
3182,6812,"I was so confused by this place. I really thought I was on an old MTV or VH1 reality show where you win money if you can keep your cool in the midst of terrible service and food. I sat directly on a booth seat and felt all the crumbs from previous diners melt into the back of legs. The appetizer was so weird- a plate of taco condiments (cold radishes, jalapenos, and carrot sticks?). The bread was stale and the complimentary one piece of cheese toast, passed out sparingly from a restaurant-wide communal basket,  was no where near as good as the Sizzler's bread I ate as a child. We waited hungrily 30 min before our order was taken (we didn't get to pick sides) and waited 1 hour and 20 minutes in the restaurant before recieving our steaks which were topped with 2 cups of greasy green onions. It was the strangest thing I have ever seen. I felt afraid to make the waitresses mad because they were in general so inhospitable, but especially because one waitress was throwing down plates and tacky plastic plate covers  so hard on an adjacent party's table I thought the table would break. I can't believe this Dinela meal was the same cost as Arroyo Chop House, Mortons, and Ruths Chris. I still think it was a reality show game that  I lost at.",0
3183,6813,"This was my first time visiting the Dal Rey. It has an old school mafioso feel to it, very dimly lit for an intimate experience. Was pretty slow on a Monday at noon. They have valet so you can pull up and hop out the Porsche lol or your earth friendly hybrid if that's your thing. I was here for a business luncheon and since I had never been here I let the server suggest what I should get. I don't eat meat, but I do seafood so she suggested the house style baked sea bass with Parmesan and lightly crusted special. I have had sea bass at many top restaurants in LA and other states, but I can honestly say that this was one of the best I've had. It came with creamy mashed potatoes and asparagus. They offered a lot of other seafood dishes as well as nice steak options but this was so good that I can't imagine ordering anything different when I go back. From what I could tell everyone enjoyed their choices because no one had any food left on their plate lol. I can't say what the price was since i didn't get to see the check, but I can say that I'd happily pay $20+ for my dish.",0
3184,6814,"After hearing about this restaurant for some time, I noticed they were participating in DineLA, and decided to go.  I am so glad!  The pepper steak is definitely a ""must have"" as it is their signature item....  But don't sleep on the scallop appetizer!  Wow- it was delicious!  The desserts (yes, I tried several!)- creme brulee, tiramisu, AND chocolate souffle were all done in a classic style, with the souffle being ""prepared"" tableside.  Old school service, with great attention to detail!  Wish is were a bit closer, but I will be back!",0
3185,6815,"Went with a party of 4 to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday.  I've passed by this place many times to and from my way to work and never knew what the big deal was since it doesn't look like much from the outside and isn't located in the best of neighborhoods (as many other reviewers have already mentioned).  However, the decor is steakhouse classy and it fills up quickly for dinner so reservations are recommended, especially on a weekend.  Parking is by valet only ($3.50 service charge).  The crowd seemed to be a little on the older side (think 40s and above or older families) and we seemed to be the youngest ones there.The food was fantastic.  They start you off with a platter of fresh raw veggies (carrots, celery, radish, pickles, peppers) and an assortment of bread.  We ordered 2 petit pepper filet mignons, shrimp scampi, salmon with capers and butter sauce and a chocolate souffle for dessert.  The meal was served with garlic bread that was delicious though burnt to a black crisp around the edges of many of the pieces.  The only thing that really ruined the experience for me (and why I didn't rate this place higher despite really loving the food) was the service.  Service started out great and really attentive but became increasingly worse as the meal progressed.  We had to order our souffle at the same time as our entrees although it did not arrive until at least 20 minutes after our dinner plates had been cleared.  We then waited another 15-20 minutes for the check to be delivered and another 15 minutes for the credit cards to be returned with the receipts.  Overall, it took us over 2 1/2 hours to finish a meal that should have only taken 1 1/2 at the most considering we were ravenous and scarfed down our food.This may be an isolated incident since I've heard that the service is generally pretty great but this experience would definitely cause me to think twice about dining here if I'm on a time restraint.",0
3186,6816,"Waited until 8pm on valentines day even though our reservation was at 730 and we got there at 720. Then we get called along with another couple right after us, only to be told it was a mistake and only one table was available and get asked to wait...AGAIN. The people who were called right after us got seated, however. Then we were given a crappy table at the bar with a bone chilling draft from the front door, which was also so loud I couldn't hear my husband. So upset we left. Thanks for ruining my valentines day with your awful service Dal Rae. It will be a long time - if ever - that we revisit your establishment.",0
3187,6817,"I have been wanting to eat here for decades and the closure of our favorite fine dining locations closer to home finally got us here.First--people have posted if you aren't white the service isn't the same.  The clientele Sunday night reflected that of the area--white/Asian/Hispanic.  Service appeared to be the same to every one--every one eating and happy.We had Mary Jane as our waitress--she has been mentioned before on Yelp and is as great as reviewed.  Dinner took close to two hours--we had plenty of time to enjoy our cocktails before ordering and service between courses was not rushed.It is restaurant week so we did the $49 3 course prix fixe menu.  Rather than having soup or salad my husband ordered the crab stuffed mushrooms and I ordered the fried zucchini.  The mushrooms were excellent--did not detect excessive breading another reviewer complained about.  The zucchini was very good--but some pieces were a bit overly dark brown--not burnt but close.  I ordered the filet pepper steak--so good outstanding quality of beef.  My husband ordered the Chilean Sea bass--it was so good I will order it the next time we go.  We also got dessert--we ate the crème brulee there and took the cheese cake home.  Also served was a nice relish tray (carrots, celery, dill pickle, pepperoncini, small red peppers) and bread basket with yummy sourdough, breadsticks (small in plastic wrap), and something like pizza bread crust--also very tasty.  Entrees included potato or tomatoes or rice--we both ordered the baked potatoes.  Garlic cheese bread was also served  Portions were so large, we will be having left overs for dinner.  We were both still stuffed when we left.Next visit will include the tableside Caesar salad--and Cherries Jubilee!Only negative is the $4.50 valet fee--but typical at many of these restaurants.We have a new favorite special occasion restaurant!Piano in bar/TV in bar--but no one in it Sunday night.",0
3188,6818,"The Dal Rae was my parent's ""date spot"" and our family's special place for dining when I was a girl.  As an adult I have always loved to dine there and share the experience with my husband and our friends.  The food never disappoints, the service is always gracious and timely.  We took my mother in law there for her 83rd birthday dinner last week and were having a lovely time when one of the managers (?), Jared, stopped to see how we were doing.  In our conversation I related to him my childhood memories of family, great food and ""shirley temples"".  Within a short time a ""shirley temple"" was delivered as a gift on the house to our table, complements of Jared!That gift brought tears to my eyes!My mother-in-law can't wait to return and says that was one of the best dinners and best nights out she has had in a long time.  Thank you Dal Rae :)",0
3189,6819,"We've been coming here for years and within the last year this place has messed up my order every single time, I really don't know why we keep coming back. This particular review is for our server John. It took almost 30 mins of sitting at our table before our order was taken. Never got a refill until the end of our meal and that was AFTER we had to ask for it. I ordered the filet mignon medium well with béarnaise sauce. What I got was their pepper style filet mignon that I did not order and a different sauce that was definitely not béarnaise sauce. When I told our server that that wasn't the steak I ordered he claimed that was the only one on their prefix menu (not correct as I checked the menu). He never offered to fix it and my steak was more well done then a medium well steak. Save your money and go to Flemings, much better food and service!",0

I had been here before and LOVED the ambiance, the food and was quite impressed with the drinks and bar which has a performer playing piano music; so I decided to introduce this hidden spot to my boyfriend for our one year anniversary dinner.We arrived to a full bar and restaurant, and ordered a Belvedere Tonic, 3 limes for me and a Manhattan for him. We didn't wait too long as we had reservations, and were sat in a quiet booth (for a packed house anyway!).  We decided to start our evening by sharing the chopped salad, which is enough for 3 or 4 people, and delicious normally, but had a little too much dressing this time. I decided to go with the Filet, cooked at medium and my boyfriend ordered the signature Pepper Filet, Medium. We devoured the relish plate that is served with every meal, and I ended up LOVING the vegetables which were so fresh and yummy! I had most of my steak left. My boyfriend raved about the baked potato, but will get the regular filet next time instead of the pepper steak.Now for the drinks. Their Martini's are superb and perfectly made. Great balance of flavors and chilled just right. Drinks are strong here, and we had a good little buzz going on - thank God we took a taxi. I highly recommend this bar, and you are able to dine in the lounge as well. The bartenders know their drinks here, and know them well.",0
3191,6821,Brought my wife here for our anniversary. We had a very nice time. Waitress was knowledgeable and attentive. I always enjoy eating here. Steak was cooked just right. In the past we have had crab legs and crab cake...all were tasty. Can't wait to come back.,0
3192,6822,"Over priced tasteless food, ordered the peppercorn steak, medium and it seemed medium-well... I had to add salt to the steak to give it flavor, very disappointing with the food. I don't understand what the rave is about when the food was tasteless. I've been here twice in hopes that I might get to try the great steak ppl rave about :(",0
3193,6823,"The Dal Rae has the best steak & food in general. Homemade ranch- table side Caesar salads, fresh bread, great drinks, great service, what more could you ask for? If I could afford it I would come here everyday!",0
3194,6824,"We were here for a Christmas dinner. We made reservations at 8pm. We got there a little after 8 and they still hadn't sat a few of their 7pm reservations. The lady at the reservation desk wasn't apologetic, she just kept explaining to everyone how it wasn't her fault. She didn't offer anyone complimentary glasses of wine for the inconvenience nor did she go to the tables in the dinning room and explain to them that people had been waiting for their tables since 7.  To make a long story a little shorter, about 4 groups left and went somewhere else, us included. Hopefully next time they handle the situation a little bit better. Some of the groups that left were irate!",0
3195,6825,"I love the Del Rae!Its a bit pricey, but this place is delicious. I can confidently say they make the best steak Ive ever tasted. I remember the first time I ordered the pepper steak, I was all excited cause I loved pepper steak and had heard about all the reviews. When they brought the plates to our table, I was crippled. I had anticipated pepper corn steak, the steak they brought me was full of all kinds of vegetables on top of the steak. I despise vegetables, so I scooped all of it off and begrudgingly sliced my first chunk of meat off. I found the steak to be amazing! After a few bites, i decided to try the vegis, and surprisingly, they tasted fantastic, I ended up scooping it all back on and and devouring the whole thing. My girl and I also had our first Souffle at the Del Rae, found it to be interesting as well as delicious. Its a real fancy place, by its look on the outside, you would think it was some 50's roller rink. But once you get in the parking lot, all you see is Benz, Jag, Porsche, in fact the last time we went, we sat next to Tommy Lasorda....kinda funny cause its in low budget Pico Rivera, but Im not complaining, one of the best steak houses and I dont even have to drive far.",0
3196,6826,Amazing peppersteak. Sea bass to die for. Good old days is what this place reminds me of good old times.,1
3197,6827,"So I've been here twice and I loved everything about it so I decided to take my family there for my birthday. So we had a party of 10. Everything was going great until 2 out of the 10 people ordered the exact same thing. Both of them didn't like what they tasted with the first bite and we let a server know. Let's make it clear we didn't tell our main sever our problem because she was never to be seen until we asked for the check. When we complain about the pasta not being good they let is know that they were going to remove it from our bill, which sounds like the right thing to do. Prefect.  Well then we had another guy come and was asking if we were going to take our left over home. Of course we said yes cuz it was good. Well one of us almost didn't touch our main entry due to having an appetizer prior and bread, which is normal to get full before your main dish. Well the guy accidentally through our food away instead of packing it and said he would replace it. Perfect. When we got the check I notice that we were getting charged for the pastas we return. We let the waitress know and she said ""next time you have to let me know and not anyone else"" Ummm you were never around. So then I get home and the pasta they through out were suppose to replaced cuz they messed up was just one scoop of pasta and that is it. I decided to call the restaurant. I spoke to the ""owner"" and he said "" I already removed the two pastas you didn't like from your check, I gave you what I thought should be enough for us throwing away the food and it seems that is not good enough for you. I been in business for 40 years and this is not what I'm use two and maybe you should never come again "" Click.... Ummm 40yrs??? And you can't take criticism when we tell you the food was not good. You agreed that your server through our food but to replace it I only get one scoop??? That is not how you treat customers... maybe 40 yrs have not shown you what excellent customer service is... So if you plan to go, don't complain about the food to anyone, eat it or you are going to be told not to come back.",1
3198,6828,We really enjoyed the ambiance.  Decorated nicely for Christmas!  Dined at Dal Rae Restaurant with friends for my birthday.  Highly recommend the Chilean Sea Bass was amazing!  Rib-eye was eye candy as well as good.  Calamari was a hit but not the lamb.  We were treated very well by all the staff and especially the owner.,0
3199,6829,"At first the impression is good kind of an old school 50-60's look.The hostess not very efficient, we just walked past and found our party receiving no greeting at the door.One thing to mention is this is not an inexpensive place to dine and we knew that going in. However they had a good reputation.The service was good from the wait staff. The kitchen not so good. Sort of a long wait for food for a place that was not that busy, only 75% full during our meal.So let's get to the food. I ordered the calamari, a JUMBO shrimp cocktail, prime rib petite cut advertised as 10oz. and a child's plate of fried shrimp and French fries. Before I go on let me say we were there for a special occasion and I just could not bring myself to spoil the evening by sending back food to be replaced. Which I highly unusual for me. The calamari was tuff and the basket had some fresh and some that had been reheated a second time in the fryer. The 8 of us at the table managed to come to the same conclusion. The shrimp cocktail was ok. The fried shrimp served to my 10 year old had a strange taste to the breading almost sweat but not in a good way. So after pulling off as much breading as possible she did eat most of it. My prime rib was very well seasoned. I did feel that even for prime rib there was an exceptional amount of fat and uneatable content. The mashed potatoes were ok nothing special and no garlic or any flavor other then potato. I did find the side dish of cream corn was prepared well and was tasty.The birthday boy ordered a filet rare. Out came this very hugh cut of beef, Cooked to a pulp which the server replaced with prime rib once she was asked. I took note he received a nicer piece of prime rib then I, must have been from a different roast.Even with the food not being what was expected the furnishing was uncomfortable which made it worse. The tables have out bound legs so when two tables are put together someone has to straddle the two center legs and the people at the sides have to maneuver around the other leg. Truly tables from the 50's.Over all the experience is not worth going back for. Maybe it was a bad night for them after all we all know how busy Wednesday nights are in what was described as a fine dining establishment! NOT. I have to be real frank, this place will not be on my return give them a second chance list.",1
3200,6830,"Update to the sunglasses. 10 minutes after I posted my original review about management, my sunglasses magically appeared. I stand by my original statement, the food is great, management needs some help. Blaming a customers family for employment theft/laziness is not the type of customer service I will support with my money.",0
3201,6831,"This review is not based on the food.  The food is great, you can read plenty of other reviews on what dishes are best.I am writing a review on management and how they handled my lost item.My family and I had dinner here to celebrate two birthdays.  We were a party of seven sat at a table set for 8.  I entered the restaurant during day light hours which had me wearing my sunglasses.  I sat next to the open seat and set my glasses on the edge of the table.The dinner lasted 2 hours and in the hustle of our good byes as we left I left my sunglasses.  I emailed the company first thing when I realized and received a very brief reply that they were not found.  This prompted me to call.I called and spoke to a woman at the front desk who told me they have sunglasses, but none that were nice and they were found on a different day anyways so they couldn't be mine.  Not sure why this info was given as it was not helpful at all.I asked her to look again at which point a male employee picked up and stated my sunglasses were not there.  I asked him if he could double check.  Here is his reply.""Sir your sunglasses are not here so they must have been taken by someone in your party and they did not tell you they have them or they were stolen by the following patron.""  ""We find bags of money at this restaurant and they are turned in so no one that works here would steal your sunglasses.""  I asked how could another patron steal them as the table would have to be cleaned at which point the sunglasses would be seen.His reply;""Sir I told you that no one at this restaurant would ever steal so as I said it is either someone in your family or another patron.""I thanked him and hung up.This makes not eating a $1000 dollar meal at this restaurant ever again very easy.",1
3202,6832,"I absolutely adore Del Rae. Service is always great and food very tasty. I dined during Dine LA for the price of $34 dollars for a 3 course meal! Before even starting our appetizers we were given a bowl of vegetables, peppers and radish on ice to snack on as well as bread and butter! For my appetizer I had the Ahi Tuna on toasted bread (most delicious), and as an entree I had white fish topped with caramelized onion, coated with a delicious sauce.  For dessert, I had the sundae ice cream cookie, which was only so-so.  I love going to Dal Rae, even though the crowd is usually quite older, around 40 and up I guess, I would come back for Dine LA again!  Fine dining at a perfect price!",0
3203,6833,"I'm so glad that restaurants like this one exist.  Stop #5 on the Monte Cristo quest.  The execution here was excellent but the ingredients, notably the cheese, left me a little flat.  Also they gave me grape jelly, not the strawberry or raspberry that I prefer.  So it's not my favorite MC, but it is up there.  The other things we ordered were out of this world!  You have to get the chopped salad.  I was dreaming about it later that night.",1
3204,6834,Taken here for a business function. I had high hopes for the place because it was packed for a Monday night. We had the seafood sampler and the calamari for apps which were good. I had the specialty steak...the peppered prime ny steak with the baked potato. The steak was cooked medium like I asked but was not hot n was bland. Will not be coming back.,0
3205,6835,"I went here for my birthday, I must say that their service was exceptional, their table Cesar salad was delicious and their signature Steak was delicious...the building is a bit outdated, and the inside is a bit dim but if you love the old school Gangster movies you'll feel like you've stepped back in time to the Casino Era, at the end of the day it's a great experience. Staff is wonderful, service is exceptional I highly recommend it",1
3206,6836,"I hated liver and onions my whole life till I tried a bite of my Grandfathers.You know they are doing something right when they can make you love and crave liver and onions.I also am not a fan of meat of any sort and am mostly a vegetarian but I crave the red meat they serve here and it astonishes me.It's a complete miracle to my taste buds.I could eat here everyday and usually eat here almost once a month with my grandfather who has been coming for I think I heard him say over 30 years.It is a must.Great history, great atmosphere, great food.Only one thing the waitress seemed a little snobby but she was old and not everyone likes their life lolStill 5 stars ;)",1
3207,6837,"This place was horrible.  I see a lot of good reviews.  They are old or, the few regulars that I suppose will remain loyal.  The service and food here are unacceptable.  I see another review from the table.  We could not have done that as our table was too crowded and unattended to.  This is truly a waste of time and money.  Sizzler has better food and service.  The people here are very rude.  Three waitresses sat outside smoking sucking up to some of couple that came in for dinner.  Obviously they figured this guy for money and sucked up.  It was embarrassing.   I would not waste a night at this dump..",1
3208,6838,"Truly a hidden gem in the ghetto. The food is great! Can't go wrong with the steaks.  I'm not a lamb person but they cook it to perfection. Oh and the baked brie is to die for.  If you don't want to dine in there, there is a pretty nice bar area where you can just grab some wine and appetizers. The prices are fair and the food is good. what more can you ask for?",0
3209,6839,I thought the food was awesome the desserts were even better if you have children take them for the bananas Frambe or cherries Jubilee it will amaze them,0
3210,6840,Highly disappointed.  Went there for the 4th time to celebrate our anniversary and won't go there again. I ordered a dirty martini and I think they forgot to add the vodka. ..I got an olive juice cocktail instead.  My Husband ordered a Cadillac and it was pure Margarita mix!   I ordered the pepper steak cooked well and instead got a well done awful piece of something.   Too bad - we'll have to go elsewhere for our 23 rd anniversary.,0
3211,6841,"A little bit of a drive to this place since we are coming from Corona, but well worth it! The ambiance alone is so cool, the food a bit pricey, but again well worth it. We were told it was going to be an hour wait, but were seated about 20 minutes later, that rarely happens! I had the Chicken Piccata with Rice Pilaf, so yummy!! If you are looking for a good steak house, great seafood, chicken and great atmosphere this is the place!",0
3212,6842,"I have heard good things about the Dal Rae for years from my Dad, Jim Smith, and on Sunday I got to experience it first hand. This is a restaurant that IS the destination..and not somewhere you grab a bite to eat before going somewhere else. the staff does not try to rush the dining experience and  knew the right timing for the drinks, salad, entrees and dessert. All of the staff were very polite and professional without being intrusive; we were fortunate to have a server named Heidi who helped make our evening a great experience. A caesar salad was prepared tableside by one of the managers, and we ordered the pepper steak and garlic mashed potatoes. We split the entree ($8 to split and it includes an extra side dish) so we would have room for dessert. So glad we did! Heidi recommended the Gold Brick Sundae and it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. It was a wonderful experience! We returned last Sunday on 11/15 and had another great dinner!  Our server this time was Eileen.  She was polite,  professional and friendly! The pepper steak, garlic mashed potatoes and caesar salad were all prepared just right! Thanks again for another great evening!",0
3213,6843,"This place is Over priced.  i was expecting more from a high end steak house,Nothing spectacular. I ordered the pepper filet medium.  It was tough,not what a filet should be.  The mashed potatoes were good. The rock shrimp was very mushy and tasted like it was just sitting under a heat lamp.",0
3214,6844,"I've been a fan since 1979 when my father-in-law first introduced me to fine dining. The food is divine, the atmosphere takes me to a time when service was top notch. We go for special occasions, anniversaries, graduations and special birthdays. This weekend was one of those events - my 55th birthday!  Imagine my disappointment when our waitress was substandard. We waited quite a bit to have our order taken, our drinks were finished before she even came by, she actually ignored us quite a bit. We had Oysters Rockerfeller (Wow they were to die for) then again we had to wait for our salads - which were on the way, we could see the and we were waiting... and waiting.....waiting.....  We both ordered $69.00 entrees and mine arrived cold -pilaf had zero flavor... I didn't want to complain but should of,  my husband wanted to treat me to a wonderful 55th birthday treat on Sunday and with a $250.00 plus tab it should of been and usually is. One bad waitress can ruin the the whole deal. If is wasn't for my companion - it would of been a wash. We will go back - but will steer clear of Heidi - she made for an un-digestable dinner.  It is amazing how one bad server can turn an awesome dinner into a cold - untasty meal. At least there was pickles and bread.",1
3215,6845,"The food is to die for. Quality food like this isn't available anywhere in a 30 mile radius from this gem. Prices are fair, spotless everything and staff is the kindest.",1
3216,6846,"I too noticed a big change in service. I've been coming to Dal Rae for 20+ years.  My business colleagues recently told me about major concerns regarding Dal Rae good service is a thing of the past. Now, it's  overcrowded, it's taking too long to be served. The owners Kevin and Lauren will have Kevins son-in-law, He will be taking over the business. I saw him this evening, he was quite rude and arrogant to a customer that just asked about the dish he was preparing. He didn't even make eye contact with customers.  I was sitting close by. Many of the waitresses that I knew were no longer working there.. My prime rib was tough and I had to send it back, my Wedge salad had no flavor.  I'm truly disappointed. Fortunately, I had a nice waitress . However, if this is a sign for the future...please count me out. I won't be returning.",0
3217,6847,"dal rae is a classic steakhouse untouched by time, which is evident by the neon arrow sign pointing you towards old skool americana at its finest.  i like to imagine how this place was back in the day (think 60's) when it was still kosher to smoke in eating establishments.  i envision it dimly lit with ribbons of smoke slowly gliding through the air with their patrons all dressed in their finest and the ladies rocking beehives...kinda ""mad men-ish"" if ya know what i mean.  (yes, i watch too much tv.)anyhow..40 years later this place is still rockin'.  was introduced to it by a friend who has been coming here with her family for years..good find.  parking is valet and reservations are a must from what i could tell.  we went on their anniversary night and the place was packed!  so much so that they had our group set up, along with a few others, in the private banquet area off the bar.for starters we had the fried rock shrimp (sweet and sour and tasty), ahi sashimi toast (splendid sans the capers) and baked brie (to die).  it's a shame i indulged in so many starters cuz it made eating my filet near impossible even though it was cooked, or should i not cooked, perfectly medium rare.  it was oh so good, but i was oh so full.  the mighty stiff cocktails probably didn't help the cause either but i'm not complaining..i appreciated the hearty pours.so yeah...classic menu, great wine list and lively crowd.  i'd def recommend this place if you're looking for good eats in a spot that's not so uppity.",1
3218,6848,"Food is good.  Very rich and fulfilling.  I ordered al la ben sea brass.  My friend ordered prime rib.  Both dishes were wonderful.  Prime rib was very juicy.  If you want to impress your date, you can order a made-to-order salad.  They will have a chef performing in front of you.  Waiters are very friendly and give good suggestion.  You must valet your car.  This is something I don't like.  They have a huge parking lot.  Parking space is not an issue here.  I don't understand why they must make you valet.  The guy who valeted my car is a smoker.  I don't like people who smoke sitting in my car.  For security reasons, I don't like going to places that I must valet.  The decoration looks very old school.  The bar area is kind of smell funny.  It may be some water damage on the carpet.  With this much of money, I expect everything must be perfect.  That's why I take out one star on decoration.",0
3219,6849,It was a great place for lunch the salad was very delicious with a light dressing and   Chilean sea bass was excellent. The service was GREAT from waitress and parking attendants. This will be on my list to take my clients when we close a Real Estate Transaction because I want to wow them with my service and satisfy them with a great meal.,0
3220,6850,"This restaurant is simply delightful. Second time visiting on a busy Friday night. We had the patio reserved for a larger party. The patio is small, quieter than inside & relaxing. Inside had live music/ DJ. The valet parking is very convenient & you don't wait long for your vehicle. Very professional. The food is consistently good & cooked to perfection. The cold veggies were great to start, followed by excellent appetizers. One appetizer was the oyster on the half shell. Very good.  The Caesar salad & garlic bread were very tasty; appropriate seasoning & crunch. The petite filet mignon was cooked medium well per my request and was paired with asparagus. The asparagus was large, tender & cooked to perfection. I ordered a side of tomatoes instead of a baked potato or mashed potatoes. I expected a few thin slices. Instead, two slices that looked like half of a large tomato arrived. I don't know how it was prepared, but it was divine. We were all very full, but we ordered three desserts to taste. Although two didn't look as ""pretty"" as the cheesecake, they were absolutely amazing. One was the chocolate soufflé & the other was the Grand Marnier soufflé. Both were sweet and flavorful. Lastly, the service was very good. I never even had to ask for water. I don't think you will be disappointed.",0
3221,6851,The cheese bread is great. The chopped salad is another good item that is big enough to split.,1
3222,6852,Delicious and sweet crab legs and juicy filet mignon. Customer service is always great!,0
3223,6853,"Peppered filet minion steak!!!  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!  We've been coming here for years. We celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, holidays and just simple dinners here. Service is always great and anything you order off of the menu is gonna be phenomenal. Trust me.  We even bring our now three year old son with us every time and he loves the kids menu too. They're very kid friendly which is a plus for parents like us who like to eat fancy dinners with our child. :)",0
3224,6854,"Excellent food - classic, ""rat pack"" sort of vibe. Feels vintage and classy.I highly recommend getting either the ahi sashimi on toast or the baked brie for an appetizer - I would drive all the way out to Pico Rivera just to eat the appetizers.The chopped salad is fabulous and the prime rib french dip is to die for. Any one of the menu items prepared tableside is delicious and normally it is prepared by one of the owners!For dessert I recommend the flourless chocolate cake. The combination of the dense chocolate and the coffee ice cream is excellent. But the crème brulé and bananas flambé are close behind!Our favorite server is Jacki G - ask for her if you want great service!",0
3225,6855,"Food: beyond amazing!! We had crab cakes and this Bree cheese thing for appetizers. Had the angel hair pasta, also amazing!Service: wonderful. Polite, upbeat, and they knew their menu items!",0
3226,6856,First time here - found it on Yelp. Spectacular. There were four in our party and everyone loved their food.,1
3227,6857,"I've grown up coming here. My parents like it, but I just can't seem to get into it. It's a fancy restaurant with a majority of the crowd older in age. Service for this past meal was ok. We had to keep asking for water refills. 3 of the 4 ordered the peppered filet and baked potatoes and I had the hearts of romaine salad. What I don't like is around the holiday time is the special menu they have and it seems the regular menu is cut in half. There was only one chicken dish and it did not sound good at all. Everyone liked their steaks and they were prepared properly, but I had asked for my salad with no cheese or avocado and it still came out with avocado smothered all over it. The salad was also an actual heart of romaine or a chuck of the romaine, I assumed it was chopped so it was weird cutting up my salad. Anyways, they had dessert and were happy. I just wish they had more dairy options on menu rather than having to order a lot of stuff with out the cheese because there is that chance they will mess up. Good meal but expensive.",0
3228,6858,"After reading all the reviews i was expecting a lot from the Del Rae. The food was good, not great and not worth the money. The service was better, not necessarily the waiter but the busboys. They were more active then the waitress. I do not know if i would go back with so many other high end steak houses in the LA/OC metro area. The atmosphere was pleasant and the restaurant looked nice, put me into a circa-1950's steakhouse.",0
3229,6859,"Went again with the family at Christmas time and it was an excellent experience once again.  I tried the Sea Bass this time, which was excellent but a lot creamier and richer than I was expecting from a fish dish.  Will gladly go back again whenever I get the chance.  Service is excellent. Great place for special occasions and celebrations.",0
3230,6860,"Excellent food and service.  Everything was prepared to perfection.  I highly recommend their pepper steak and I have heard amazing things about the Sea Bass, so that is definitely what I will get next time.  It may be old, but it is really classy and they do a good job keeping the place up.",0
3231,6861,"If I could give them 6 stars I would. I have been a patron of the Dal Rae for over 30 years and they never fail to impress me with the food, cocktails and service!Take a step back in time to another era in Southern California. There are still items on the menu that were on their menu 30+ years ago. Many of the dishes have been updated and there is a mix of some new items that might someday become classics.Again on this visit, had the fresh fish ala bene - a Mediterranean style treatment that is savory and delightful.The entree proceeded by a selection of Appetizers- baked brie with a Pesto-style sauce, was wonderful, and the Ahi on toast with a salad blue cheese crumbles and a server suggested slice of avocado was unbelievable. The french onion soup was sweet, buttery and full of onions topped with plenty of melted cheese,We all started with our favorite martinis- always well-made and big enough so u don't need a second one. They have some interesting vodkas, on gluten free and another one organic.We finished with deserts - some prepared table-side and after dinner drinks.Excellent food, drinks and service and a decor and mood that takes a seep back in time!!!!Surf",0
3232,6862,"I just attended a friends 60th Bday party at Dal Rae, and have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The decor is throwback to the 80's  kinda of dark which gives it a cool vibe. The food was amazing especially the homemade garlic cheese bread!!! They also have a DJ, on Fri, Sat, who really gets the place going I will definitely be back.",0
3233,6863,"Love the vintage vibe here. The service is excellent and the food is top notch. I had the best crab cakes I've ever had in my life, and I've had quite a few. Really enjoyed the singer in the bar and stayed after dinner to enjoy the entertainment. Looking forward to coming back!",0
3234,6864,"After years of driving by here, I finally had the opportunity to go here for lunch. The servers were very friendly attentive. I thought their meals were reasonably priced. I have heard many good things about their Caesar salad, but I did not try one. It seemed like a classy place to take a date for dinner.",1
3235,6865,"The Dal Rae is 20 miles from where I live so I don't make it there that often but when I do, the drive fades into the background because the dining experience is always stellar.  I went as part of the DineLA promotion and got to enjoy my favorite pepper steak along with the crabcake appetizer and tiramisu at an amazing price.  The crabcake starter had a nice crispy coating over light flaky crabmeat.  The pepper steak was done to tender perfection and coated with their signature combination of green onions, bacon and peppercorn.  The final course of tiramisu was a perfect ending.  Service was attentive and although we didn't order anything flambé, we witnessed a few incidents and it's always special to watch.  I brought a friend for her first visit as I've talked up the pepper steak many times over the last several years and we've been for many a steak (and meal) over time, too.  She found the meal memorable as well.  We're also fond of LA Time Machines, and although the Dal Rae modernized a few years back, it still has the retro feel overall.  The wine list was extensive and helpful with its descriptions by varietal.  Although it wasn't a special occasion, a night at the Dal Rae always feels like one.",0

3237,6867,"I hadn't been here in a long time- we celebrated a birthday lunch here and this place was POPPIN. No joke- middle of the week at Noon- every table was full. The food was amazing and the service was really great. My husbands family requested a specific waitress, I wish I could remember her name but she was very sweet and on top of things. I had the halibut and ate every bite. Honestly- no complaints. It's even had a major face lift inside since I was there 5+ years ago. I will visit again!",0
3238,6868,"Love the old school vibe.  Service was impeccable with two people taking care of our party of 8. Drinks, relish tray, bread,  soups and salads were great all around for our party. No complaints .  My NY pepper steak left something to be desired, especially for the price. Meat was tough and cooked beyond what I requested. Wife and other guests who ordered fish were much happier than those of us who ordered steaks (odd for a steak joint). Dessert saved the meal. Gran Marnier soufflé is a must. Over all a good night but the fact that my (nearly) $50 steak was not up to par with similarly priced steaks at other high end steak houses I'm Not sure I would go back on my own dime.",0
3239,6869,"This is what happens when establishments get greedy and sacrifice a quality food ""experience"" in return for profit.I grew up in Pico Rivera and now live in Pasadena and we have been going to Dal Rae for years. My best friend and her husband (who live in Chino Hills) and I, along with my boyfriend have been celebrating our birthdays at Dal Rae for  at least the last 5 years. It ""was""   tradition that we looked forward to every year.Unfortunately for the last two years what ""USED"" to be a great dining experience has been less than memorable.The lounge which after dinner you would be able to enjoy an after dinner drink and listen to music has now been converted to an extension of the restaurant. Small tables crammed into the lounge where you have to dodge servers preparing their famous Cesar salad to get to the restrooms.Even though there are numerous steak houses to go to in Pasadena we chose to drive to Pico to go to Dal Rae because it had special memories for us, and used to be worth the drive.The quality of the food is still pretty good but the overall experience has gone down hill.Sad to see a good thing gone bad.",1
3240,6870,"Impeccable service.Steady courses coming at good times to allow you to have your private time and conversation.They start you off w/ a bread basket w/ sesame sticks, some thin cookie snack texture bread, and sourdough bread and a stick of butter. A veggie tray w/ celery, carrots, turnip, jalapenos, and cucumbers come on ice--yea, I guess you just snack while waiting?From the DineLA menu, 3 courses per person at $34/each, we hadAppetizers:1)Ahi Sashimi on Toast-thin pieces of fresh quality ahi sashimi layered on top of cheese, red onions, capers, and something else on toast. I normally do not enjoy Sashimi but this was delicious!2)Crab cakes were to die for-best I have ever had. It came w/ a cilantro sauce that was the right tangyness and flavor. Crab chunks were fresh and large.Main course- Pepper Steak Filet Mignon. Medium rare is definitely more juicy than just medium. The meat was of quality and very tender and juicy. Topped w green onion, pepper, etc. and a side of green beans-seasonal and fresh.Side of mashed potatoes were creamy and garlicy. Most people got the baked potato though. They prepare it for you--slather it in front of you w/ the butter stick and tons of sour cream. Looked much too creamy for me.Dessert:1) Ice cream Sunday w/ lace cookie- a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream w/ a hardened thick layer of chocolate (tasted german/belgian--not your standard milk), enveloped by a lace cookie which was thin and sweet; it reminded me of sticky hard toffee which i  love. on the bottom of the cookie was whipped cream. Pretty good, bit sweet though2) Creme Brulee- not the best I've had. It had too much of an egg taste. Not very creamy in the right way. Topped w/ 1 raspberry. The layer of brown sugar on top was bitter sweet.Outside of the DineLA menu, we also ordered the Classic caesar salad for two. $17. A rip off. It's very standard. Only the casear dressing itself was thick and chunky--not creamy as normal caesar is. I wouldn't order it again. It definitely was not worth the money.AND it was way salty.",0
3241,6871,"WOW! The pepper steak here is amazing and it's huge! I came here for Christmas dinner and it was packed out the door. We made a reservation, but unfortunately still had to wait around 15 minutes. The food comes out ridiculously slow so make sure to be around good company. Also, the waitress did not clarify the soup was not included in the entree. She simply asked what soup we would like after taking our order. Luckily, we were all in a good mood after an amazing dinner and, after all, it was Christmas so we didn't really mind. I can't say it'll be the same for any other occasion since 6 $8 mediocre soups on our tab is not necessarily a happy surprise.5 stars for the steaks and appetizers3 stars for the LOOOOOOONNNNGGGG (over an hour) wait for the food.",0
3242,6872,"My family and I have been going to the Dal Rae for many years now and we love it! The food is not only amazing, but it's such a good family environment. The owners go around to the tables and greet you. We go as often as we can! I highly recommend it, and my favorite dishes are the ceaser salad (made at your table!), shrimp scampi, pepper steak, lobster, and of course the garlic cheese bread!",0
3243,6873,"Great food long wait even with reservations, great music and the best server ""Michelle"". We will return. LOVE the salad and crab cakes",1
3244,6874,Excellent as always. This restaurant hardens back to a different era  from the crudités appetizers to  old school menu items and killer martinis. Chilean sea bass is excellent. Service was top notch. This place never disappoints.,1
3245,6875,"I am revising this due the snobbish hostess.   Not sure what I did to offend her, but she made sure to ruin the evening.   7pm reservation that wasn't sat until 7:30, as later reservations were sat before us.   After bringing this to her attention, she sat us in a room by ourselves that smelled like a parking lot.   When I asked for a different table, I was told there was nothing else available.   We left and have not returned.",0
3246,6876,For the price it is not worth it.  The food is just OK it is nothing fantastic.   and yet they charge so much.  Then they charge you for valet parking also they do not validate.  I will never go back there again what a disappointment.,1
3247,6877,"Unimpressed. The food was definitely overrated and overpriced. The service was HORRIBLE!!! You would think that when you tell your server that you are so excited to be at their restaurant that they would do whatever possible to make your experience pleasant. Nope, not the case here. There was no explanation of the menu and no recommendations given to a party of 6 who had never dined at the Dal Rae. After all of that one of our orders was the completely wrong dinner. UGH! To top it off we were there to celebrate a birthday, not a WOW type of evening. I would not recommend the Dal Rae. Stick to Lawry's in LA or Houston's they both have impeccable service and better quality of food for the price. Completely let down by all of the 5 star reviews. Perhaps the culinary expectations of others simply do not live up to mine.",0
3248,6878,"We went to The Dal Rae for Dine LA restaurant week last night, and I have to say it wasn't as good as I hoped. On the plus side, it's a classic steakhouse from 1958, with big booths, a lounge and a piano player - the kind of place I love. They have an extensive martini menu. My main disappointments were slow service and my steak was just too peppery. You couldn't really enjoy the flavor of the meat. It is called a pepper steak so I guess I should have expected it, but it was extreme. The romaine salad was fine, with good dressing and the ice cream sundae was tasty. I also have to admit that I have a cold so my taste buds aren't what they should be, which is why I will give the place 3 stars instead of 2 - benefit of the doubt. Another downside was that they really pack in the tables so you are constantly getting bumped by servers and other diners. It takes away from a relaxed ambience. The place was packed, so clearly they are doing something right. I will probably try it again sometime, but the trek to Pico Rivera from Culver City is a long one! I was intrigued by the tableside flaming Steak Diane presentations and tableside spinning caesar salads that I saw at other tables - those were not Dine LA choices. I wish the Dine LA menu had been more creative. The lounge is probably the place to be - they even have bar seats along the edge of the piano. The other couple we went with were celebrating their anniversary and they were given a free piece of cake with a candle, so that was nice.  I love retro steakhouses but for the prices, the food really needs to be excellent and I felt Dal Rae fell short.",1
3249,6879,Love love this steak house. Our go restaurant for a romantic meal or piano bar with traditional steaks and a delish creme brûlée. Make sure and try their shrimp cocktails as a starter.,0
3250,6880,"I have always heard such raves reviews about Del Rae and decided that It would be a great place to celebrate our first wedding anniversary, um yeah wrong choice by far. Yeah the atmosphere is great, service was okay and it wasn't that busy. I ordered the pepper steak and my husband had the prime rib. First time I have tried pepper steak and I'll admit maybe not my cup of tea, but that prime rib was tough and fatty. For the money we spent so not worth it. Lawry's Prime Rib is way better.",0
3251,6881,"What an utterly huge disappointment!! My mom invited my bf and I to an early Christmas lunch.  I had  high hopes of a great and memorable meal AND experience.  My bf and I arrived to mandatory valet parking and thought ""whatever, this place is trying to be classy"".  Riiiiiiiiiiight..... We walked into the front door and was completely ignored by an older hostess who was taking a reservation on the phone- which took waaaaaaaay too long- like 5 minutes too long:  I stood there blatantly staring at this woman while she chewed -open-mouthed- a huge cheeseburger, dripping juices down her chin and onto the phone, and continued to talk to the same freaking person who she was originally making the reservation.  Her conversation included complaining about her work schedule during the holidays and the other younger hostesses who want time off to ""get drunk and stupid"" on NYE.  Finally!! another really nice hostess came up to the host stand and welcomed us to the restaurant, to which I immediately told her how unbelievably rude and inconsiderate the other woman was- and she didn't even apologize or seem to really care...... I said I had a reservation and gave her the name and she pointed over to the booth in the corner.... I wished I would have just walked past the hostess on the phone in the first place, but being a hostess myself at a full- service, fine dining restaurant, I wanted to see how truly ignorant this old lady was.  Retirement is calling your name!!! go toward the light!!!Other than the first initial experience at the front door, the service and food was sub-par and not impressive.  The decorations were cheesy for the holiday season and i wished i would have dined somewhere else....never again unless I'm 68 years old for the senior discount!",1
3252,6882,"This place never disappoints. Stars of last nights meal - crab cakes and calamari for apps, pepper steak, chicken and mushrooms and sea bass ala ben for main course, stags leap cab for wine and bread pudding and gold brick ice cream for dessert.

3258,6888,"Seriously? I come here all the time. Personally and my company has had special occasions here. I brought a professional contact here today and it was truely embarrassing. We had a blonde server who admitted to us that a bigger party was more important to her and I had to flag her down three times to get our food, a drink refill and the check. The food is consistently great... but at that price you should not feel neglected. If management cares... we dined at lunchtime on 5/18.",0

3260,6890,"Dal Rae is an outstanding restaurant and one I would highly recommend. Somewhat of an ""old school"" atmosphere whichs adds to the experiece. The ""peppersteak"" is nothing short of outstanding and their trademark steak. Perfectly cooked to your liking and so tender you can almost cut it with a fork! There aren't many restaurants that serve up this quality food so when you find one you remember. Their entire menu is great and offers up top notch entrees, side dishes and deserts. This place has been around a long time and for good reason. It doesn't get any better! Highly recommended!",0
3261,6891,"Considering the hype that this place gets, I would say I was disappointed.  The overall ambience and service was good, but the steaks themselves were just mediocre.  Maybe it was b/c I didn't enjoy their signature topping.  I just felt like it took away from the meat itself.  I guess when it comes to steaks, I'm more of a purist.  But yeah, I just couldn't get past the how the topping kind of ruined the steak.  I should have asked for it on the side, but the waitress wasn't too clear about what the topping actually was. I was expecting some pepper based sauce instead of this monsterous topping.",0

I would highly recommend!",0
3264,6894,"This is an expensive restaurant for the food that's served.  It's very ""old school,"" more like ancient school.  Food is OK but very overpriced, need to come here for business lunches that are expensed.  Had the sea bass, very good quality and well prepared.  Mandatory $4.50 valet parking, which is a must because you're in the HOOD (Pico Rivera has a very high murder rate).  Where did all these white people come from???  If you look out on street everyone is Hispanic!)",1
3265,6895,"This place is superb. The service is five star all the way. This restaurant is a throw back to traditional times with table side fresh made Caesar salad, which was delicious even with the anchovies! They set down an iced tray of pickled peppers and hot fresh sour dough bread soon after seating. The cocktails are REAL and delicious! Not watered down cheap ingredients. The Cosmo was the best I've  had in ages. We all had the Chilean Sea Bass, with lemon butter & capers and honestly, it melted in your mouth. It was seriously the best Chilean sea bass we have ever had! And this says a lot because this is one of our favorite seafood choices and we order it whenever we can. We will come back again and highly recommend this restaurant for your next special celebration.",0

3267,6897,I am very disappointed.  The food was fine. The service was less than satisfactory.  The waitress hardly came to our table and many a time we needed stuff.

3272,6902,"I'm sure the dal Rae was a prime establishment at some point in their history; however, the food now is just decent. But I'm sorry, for $150-$200 dinner for two I don't want ""just decent"" food-- I want spectacular food, which the dal Rae does not provide. The steaks (filet and rib eye) are bland and the relish tray is a waste of food--we didn't even touch it. The prime rib is sad and lacked depth in flavor. The duck was just ok.  I don't mind the outdated decor--the dal Rae has the potential to have a cool ""rat pack"" type of vibe, but sadly, the Backstreet Boys and Natalie Imbruglia music playing in the background throws any redeeming old-school classiness  this place might have out the window.",0
3273,6903,"I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass ala Ben omgoodness best bass I'm likely to ever have.  For dessert I tried the Chocolate Fantasy...Yea, that is exactly how I'd describe it. For visual effect it was a layer of Chocolate cake followed by Chocolate mousse topped with a thick layer of Chocolate Ganache bedded over rasberry puree...seriously. The environment felt like a good time. Between the live music, lively chatter, amazing company, and flavorful food I was in heaven.  Even the owner seemed laid back, having a good time.  I'd definitely return for more.",0

Two weeks ago, my brother celebrated his ""60th"" birthday with family members.  The food was outstanding and because of the number of persons in our party we had two servers who did a great job.  My wife had the chicken piccata and I had the shrimp louie.  She loved the chicken picata, zucchini and baked potato.  It was cooked to perfection.  My salad had 6 large shrimp, crispy lettuce, fresh cut tomatoes, olives, hard boiled egg and croutons, it was a generous portion.  I asked for two types of dressings, thousand island and ranch dressing.  It was awesome!!  We had dinner on a Saturday night so the restaurant was very busy.

3275,6905,Steak with peppercorn sauce one of the worst I've had over 30+ years (mealy and not tasteful) with the peppercorn sauce tasting stale and/or watered down.

3280,6910,"Great service, awesome potatoes but for a famous steak I was expecting better. Yes it was very tender and juicy but also very flavorless. Granted the peppered topping with grilled onions was a nice addition to a wonderful piece of meat but all together was a flavorless wonder. I was afraid to ask for steak sauce, in fear of getting the common ""our steak doesn't need it"" look. The atmosphere was very nostalgic and was a great throw back to an earlier era of easier living.",0

3284,6914,"I have enjoyed coming to this establishment for over 45 years. It is our go to restaurant for special occasions.  I recently brought my son's god parents for there first visit. Our guests felt like the restaurant gave a classic old money steakhouse with an upbeat flavor especially when you have the ambiance of music coming from the piano bar.  A little bit of swoon from Sinatra to current tunes. While the menus were brought over I already knew what I wanted and have been thinking about dinner for the past two weeks. I had to have the pepper steak! My wife had the lobster thermador. The god parents had pepper steak as well, same as my son.  My daughter had chicken florentine. Loren prepared an awesome Caesar salad table-side and an off-the-menu steak tartare with toast points.  You want to make sure you order the soufflés ahead so they can arrive at the end of the meal.  We ordered a grand marnier and chocolate for the six of us to enjoy. The evening sailed by even though we thoroughly enjoyed our 3 hour event. It's not like it took that long but we enjoyed a no rush outting. The meal was pricey at over $500 and we brought our own wine. I honestly put this place above Morton's or Ruth Chris' and on par with Fleming's in Newport Beach. A classic. I",0
3285,6915,I have been there multiple times and their food and service never disappoints.  Their Chilean sea bass is out of this world and the best I have ever had. I always ask for extra caramelized onion. The peppered steak was alright but I'm not much of a meat eater and I didn't like the chopped up peppers on top of the steak. I usually get the bass. They also have pretty good wine selection.  And their bread is really good. Will def recommend.,0
3286,6916,"DineLA #1I HATE VALET PARKING.  I'm sorry, but I have my driver's license so I think I'm qualified to drive my car another 100 feet into one of the gazillion parking spaces right in front of me.  But instead, I have to pay a parking attendant $5 to park my car and mess with my headlights. So very lame!  Don't get me wrong, there are times when valet is necessary but Dal Rae is definitely not one of them.I went to Dal Rae for the DineLA menu, which was definitely a great value at $34pp.  My friend and I started with the Ahi Sashimi Toast and Calamari. On the regular menu, they each cost about $12.  Both were decent but not particularly impressive.  For the entree, we both had the Petite Filet Pepper Steak ($33 on the menu).  It's called petite but it was pretty substantial.  Perhaps we both ate too much bread before the appetizers came out because neither of us were able to finish our entree.  The steak was not one of the better steaks I've had but it was quite tender.  I asked for medium rare but it came out medium and I guess that's only a slight difference.  The steak also came with a choice of mashed potatoes or baked potato.  The baked potato was much better than the mashed potatoes.  We finished off with Creme Brulee and Tiramisu.  Ok, who came up the idea of putting strawberry drizzle on the tiramisu?  It completely killed the dessert; the flavors just weren't right anymore.  Sometimes chefs should also consider taste and not just presentation.  The creme brulee was good and it was pretty standard.  Overall, the food is 3.5 stars.  The service was pretty fast but our waitress had a bit of an attitude.  I'll give her 3 stars.  But only because I feel like I got an excellent deal with the DineLA menu, I'm giving Dal Rae 4 stars.",0

3291,6921,"Tonight was the first time my wife and I had dinner at the Dal Rae.  As an appetizer I ordered the wedge salad and the mushrooms with crab.  DO NOT order the wedge salad.  It was a simple wedge of ice berg lettuce, a single cut of a carrot along with the dressing and that was it.  No bacon slivers, croutons or other extras that other restaurants add to jazz up the salad.  The mushrooms were ok, nothing spectacular.  As an entree I ordered the bone-in rib eye steak with my wife ordering the Parmesan crusted halibut.  The halibut was good to excellent according to my wife.  My steak was superb.  Tender and tasty.  Better than some other more famous restaurant chains steak cooked at 500 degrees.  The complementary bread provided could have at least been warm to allow the easy spread of the butter, although when we received the warm garlic cheese bread this error was corrected.  For dessert my wife and I split the crime brûlée.  Not bad.  The ambiance could have been better, however it was the day before Mother's Day so we could not fault the restaurant for the busy atmosphere.  All in all it was not a bad experience and one we would like to repeat again perhaps on a less busy night.",0
3292,6922,"I came here a couple months ago, with my mom, sister, and my boyfriend to celebrate my sister's birthday.  We have been here before to celebrate other family members birthdays, my aunts who introduced us to this place.This place is a little out of place considering the area it is in, but in recent years the area has been developed and isn't as industrial as it once was.  The decor is very retro steakhouse and very romantic if someone would like to propose or to celebrate a milestone. We ordered the sampler appetizer and on others' recommendation the wilted spinach salad.  When the waitress asked how many people do you want it for, just say one order if you are going to share.  We made the mistake of saying two and we got two orders for to split between three people and we still had out entrees coming.  The salad was okay, I felt like I wanted a more bacon taste, but it wasn't really there for me.  I ordered the French onion soup and planned to share with my boyfriend who ordered the prime rib.  But I was too full from the salad to eat much of the prime rib.  But what I had from it was pretty good. My sister got the pepper steak, which she thought was only okay and felt it tasted better the very first time she had it.  My mom got the sea bass, which is her favorite and she finished her plate (she didn't eat the salad or have anything from the appetizers because she just got her braces for her teeth).  Since we told the waitress that it was my sister's birthday, they brought out a complimentary sundae.This place is pretty pricey so this isn't the type of place people can go once a week.  Service here is really nice and pretty good.  I would recommend coming here, when there is DineLA because they participate and you can get a taste of what they offer for a decent price.  One last thing is, it's valet parking only.  So remember to bring $5 because it costs, if I remember correctly $3.50 but I can be wrong, for the valet.",1
3293,6923,"We might have never learned about this lovely restaurant had it not been for a christmas gift certificate.  Yay!Let's start off with the good:Ambience!  Old school charm and festive for the holidays.  The charm of old school restaurants like this establishment, Sycamore Steakhouse, Pacific Dining Car, and the like are refreshing in this day of modern and contemporary.    Food! The comp relish plate was full of FRESH veggies.  The complimentary bread was fluffly and cheese toast was tasty. Ahi sashimi on toast: tasted great; the tuna flavor kind of gets drowned out by the feta but you still get the texture and cool temp.  THe crab caked were awesome: full of crab meat and not overly briney. the bone in rib eye was cooked perfectly in between MR and M although it was a slightly oversalted in a few spots. The choco souffle was OMG good.  Make sure you order this ahead of time as it takes time to prepare.Service! Our waitress, Dawn, was attentive yet low key.  I liked this... we could focus on the food and each other.  She also timed everything really well.  We never felt rushed or waited too long for anything.  Also, we had an unpleasant experience at the beginning of our dining experience (read about this further down), but the owner personally apologized and made peace.  Now for the bad:So the night started off a little rocky:  We made a reservations online a few nights previous for 7pm.  We were running late so the baby daddy called in to see if we could push the reservation to 8pm.  He was told almost nonchalantly that this wouldn't be a problem and that the restaurant wasn't busy.  I didn't like the sound of this as it was friday night.  I had him call back and confirm the revised reservation for 8pm.  He did this and said the lady, Teresa, said ""ok"" as if nothing was really being written down.  Hmm...we're nervous but armed with a name and hungry for some steak.  We arrive and there are a few parties waiting...hmm.  Well, we are greeted by a friendly young hostess.  We tell her about our changed reservation and she looks confused.  I would be too, I look over to their computer screen and see that our reservation was never updated to 8 pm.  WHAT?!  We ask for Teresa.  She comes to the front with an apparently perma-sour face.   She hands us a pager and we asked if she updated our reservation.  She lies and says yes and tells us the wait is only going to be 15 minutes.  We ended up waiting about 45 minutes!!!  Thank god I have been doing yoga otherwise I would have made no attempts at calming down the baby daddy, who was hungry and furious.  You see, we have a baby and don't get out for date night that often.  If she would have been honest from the beginning we could have rescheduled for another night or just rushed in at 7pm if they couldn't accommodate us at 8pm.    She eventually took us to a table after some other staff overheard us voicing our dissatisfaction and arranged for a table to be cleaned.  She did not apologize or speak one word to us.  ""Inhale,pause, exhale"" Is what I meditated on.  ""Let's try to enjoy our meal"" is what I tell my hubby.   Honesty, competence, and a smile- Too much to ask for?So if it weren't for the bitter permasour faced hostess, our experience would've have been awesome.",0
3294,6924,"First timer, will definitely be coming back.  Started off with the Oysters Rockefeller so Yummy, then the Wilted Spinach Salad was to die for cooked at your table has bacon and balsamic dressing.  Then for my main entree Dal Rae Famous Pepper Steak, I choose the 10oz Filet cooked to perfection!  I was treated to the most melt in your mouth chocolate cake slice for my Birthday; I'm not really a fan of chocolate but this was so moist and yummy I couldn't resist!",1
3295,6925,The pepper steak here is a MUST especially if you love garlic.  They give bread and crackers on the house and they're delicious.  I kept asking the waitress to bring more.  The service was awesome. The outside of the restaurant looked a bit raggity but it's the inside that counts.  I would love to come here again to try their other dishes.,0
3296,6926,"Wow! We kept meeting people that said this was a great place. We finally went on Sat night.  I have not 1 bad thing to say. From the atmosphere to the staff to the food, this place is great! It was also nice that people get a big dressed up to go, I felt a big under-dressed and next time I will amp it up a little.  The food is amazing, the caesar salad for 2, the steak au poivre, veggies etc.  Great wines. My new favorite place!",0
3297,6927,"Point Avoided : so Yelpsters really only have 1 persistent complaint about this place: ""doesn't honor our reservation"" ...we went on a Wednesday night, armed with a reservation, came early, no reservation needed - got seated right away.Best : ""Prime Rib of beef"", perfectly marbeled and prepared - the fat on this thing melts in your mouth - or was it that pretty in pink colored center? No. Leave that putrid A1 bottle, and even hold the horsey. No need.Worst : Paid valet parking? Really? Maybe its because I hate someone driving my car or the fear of someone's ugly sitting in my drivers seat (remember Seinfeld?), but they parked my car in front of the front door of the restaurant... I paid to have a guy ""roll"" my car to me when I was leaving... No. I got my wife's door, its right in front of me!It looks like a lodge from the second you get in and see the bar, to being seated. The waitresses (and its like they only employ waitresses) are in all black, and the bust guys are in tuxes, and they have those little table squigees to dust your area of crumbs... and theyll light that tea light when you sit down.I'm new to this place, so forgive me, but what's the deal with the tray of veggies? I asked the waitress for her reply some people like to eat them... could it be more sophisticated than that? Maybe for cleaning your palet (my wife's suggestion)? Either way its not for decoration, with radishes, slightly sweat pickles, celery, and big fat green peppers...They have Escargot (and probably Chabliss), and these awesome crab meat stuffed artichoke hearts for starters, and although I passed on the salad, the garlic cheese bread and the bread basket proved to be way more than necessary.The prime rib lacked the au jus (that I don't use anyway), was an awesome slightly black crusted outside to the warming pink center. What I have found over the years of consuming beef cuts is that the color can be deceiving (intensity of the heat, marinating, etc) - this one didn't have the signature bloody red accents and juice, but one cut into this with the serrated edge exposed the tendernous of the meat. I usually trim the fat, but found I wasn't being too surgical because the fat just melted...I know the ""filets"" comand a pricier point, but I have never been satisified with a 8 or even 10oz filet at around $50... for the regular cut of this ""Prime Rib of Beef"" you get 14oz for about $33 (without the bone - matters in the weight), and even the big boy is under $40 - and thatll be a unbuckle a belt loop experience I'm sure.Their signature is the pepper steak, but come for the Prime Rib, you won't be sorry!",0
3298,6928,"I've been here a few times, and I don't remember much about the first two visits. This last time, however, was amazing. Best scallops ever. Parmesan crusted w/garlic butter and carmelized onions on top. Mmmm... it was perfect. I love scallops to begin with, and I didn't know they could be THAT GOOD.Service was great. Super attentive, friendly, smiling.It's on the pricey side, but for a special occasion I would come back here in a heartbeat.",0
3299,6929,We like to dress up and go out. My girlfriend took me here for my birthday.  It is super old school.  We sat close to the bar and they had some jazz playing. Food and service was excellent. I would definitely come back again.,1
3300,6930,"Without a doubt, I had the best Chilean sea bass I've ever had in my life there.  And when you walk in, it's like you stepped into a rat pack restaurant, complete with cozy fire place and a piano you can sit around in the bar area.  The vibe is pure 1970s and the place was PACKED.  This restaurant was born in 1950s and has been owned by three generations of family for 56 years!  The owner came by the table and asked how everyone was doing.  Next time I go, I'm going to get dressed up in 50s clothing and pretend I'm back in the good 'ol days where food was yummy and excellent, staff was nice and, with my chocolate soufflé, the waitress even asked me right off the bat if I needed more whipped cream!  Wow, no one does that anymore.  Plus, she was very pretty with a beautiful smile and her hair was in an old fashioned French twist.  I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK.",0
3301,6931,"I love steak and I also love the history of this place.. they have been opened since 1958 and the like Taylor's in Korea town, we fell like you went back... way back in time.. Never been to Pico Rivera in my life but for this place, it was worth the drive. They are known for the Pepper Steak and it's awesome... also tired Lobster Thermidor, Chateaubriand, Prime Rib, Fresh Fish, Rack of Lamb.. all good... I always bring someone from out of town here and give them that old School experience with great food and service...",0
3302,6932,"Driving through town trying to find this place I gotta tell you that I thought I was lost. I then stumbled onto this huge bowling alley looking sigh that said Del Rae. It reminded me of what I'd expect out of an old Hollywood joint.Upon walking in I was greated by the 2 hostess in a very professional manner. In the bar was a piano lady busting out R&B classics as well as popular top 40 songs.The food was fantastic. I had the chilean sea bass and their caeser salad. Their salad was a meal in ifself. They make it in front of you which only adds to the meal.Would def come back here for a business meeting and would even come here on my own or with a date. Loved this place.Tried a bite of my co-workers steak too, and was cooked to perfection. She had the pepper steak.I could see why Frank SInatra used to come here back in the day. To be honest it doesn't seem like it has changed much. From the attmosphere to the sign when you first come in. This place is classic.",0
3303,6933,"I've been here for lunch twice, both times on the company dime, because this is the only ""nice"" American restaurant in the area.  The first time, I had the famous pepper steak.  It was okay.  I wouldn't put it over the offerings from any other decent steakhouse.  The string beans that came on the side were dry, tough, and not very tasty.The second time I went, it seemed as if all the businesses in the area were having their holiday lunches there.  We had to wait FORTY minutes even though we had a reservation.  This time I had the fish and chopped cobb salad.  Fish was meh, salad was tasty.  String beans once again were bad.  Side of Calamari serving was generous.Service both times was pretty decent, although not on par with someplace like Mastro's.  Overall, for the price there are much better offerings in the area if you're willing to eat ethnic food.  Otherwise make the short journey north to Pasadena or west to LA.",1
3304,6934,"This place is unexpected since its located in Pico Rivera. But its like stepping into a goodfellas movie, everything from the sign to the dim lights on the inside. The service is okay, they are attentive but do not expect expert high class service. They had a DJ playing in the bar... throughout the night he played oldies... As for dinner, we started with the baked scallops (they were very well proportioned), which were baked in their shell in horseradish sauce. we had their filet Mignon Pepper steak which was perfectly cooked and delicious ... and their petite filet Mignon that they slightly over cooked. Overall.... the food and the atmosphere make for a special night out.",0
3305,6935,"My husband and I had a great time!  Thumbs up on the Filet Mignon Pepper Sauce and Garlic Lemon Froglegs. Tableside Ceaser Salad. Escargots was awesome! Service was great, from start to finish. If you want to impress a date, this is the place for it!!",0
3306,6936,"Pretty nice place, been coming here since I was born, basically come on the weekends and every holiday. Wouldn't recommend coming on a holiday or Valentine's Day. They have a limited item menu and the service isn't as great. If you want to take your special someone here I suggest you make reservations and not to go on a holiday. I love the chicken breast with wild mushrooms.",0
3307,6937,"Dal Rae is a great restaurant.  The employees are so friendly and welcoming.  The Chilean Sea Bass ala Ben is outstanding! My husband loved his shrimp.  Don't make a face because it's Pico Rivera....you will enjoy the atmosphere, service, and food!",0
3308,6938,"Loved this place!  I didn't give it five only because Chilean sea bass is endangered and I don't believe it should be on anyone's menu.  Other than that the food was amazing, terrific service and a fun sort of retro scene.  Love the old school food!!",1
3309,6939,"WOW, must try the Alaskan crab legs. Been eating the there for years. They are the best & they are cut down the middle so you can just feast & enjoy & avoid the work of getting to the meat inside. Also a must try is their chocolate/raspberry ice cream prepared table side.",0
3310,6940,"I adore the pepper steak (I get the petite filet).  The peppery goodness with tons of green onion topping all around it and the garlic mash potatoes are to die for! Absolutely divine! Wonderful service, always very friendly. Also love the Caesar salad, the crab stuffed mushrooms, and the brie and garlic apps.",0
3311,6941,My dearly departed friend Kjell Nelson always raved about the Dal Rae and that man way the EF Hutton of Los Angeles....when he spoke everyone listened!,1
3312,6942,I really enjoy coming here although it is pricey It is definitely worth every penny. We usually spend $150.00 for 2. We usually bring our own bottle of wine...there corkage fee is $20.00.This is an old school high end steak house. The pepper filet or prime rib is to die for!! Ive also tried there shrimp scampi and shrimp cocktail are also great choices. There dessert is excellent (we've tried the chocolate flour less cake with expresso ice cream and creme brûlée) Service is always excellent.,0
3313,6943,"Haven't been here in years and only went once ...that's enough for me to remember how amazing this place is! The food,The   steak is to die for.  Service is amazing. The make your desserts right in front of you!  Best Creme Brulee  I've ever had . Many restaurants don't even offer Creme Brulee which happens to be my favorite dessert ever so major plus there. Boy,  I need to  go back asap.",0
3314,6944,"Really great prices, excellent food awesome service as well!  Best club sandwich I have had in a long time.",1
3315,6945,"Old school restaurant. Great food.  Greater service.  Our waiting person, Mary Jane was fantastic.  The pepper steak filet mignon is the best I have ever had",1
3316,6946,"Excellent not your run of the mill steakhouse.  Some of the best seafood ive had in LA.  The lobster bisque is phenom as well as the calamari, best in CA thus far.  The pepper steak was their trademark dish and certainly lived up the hype.  We had plenty of steak for leftovers.  Definately pricey but worth it for a special occasion.  Bar area had some cool live music and had a really cool old school LA mob vibe to the whole place!",0
3317,6947,"Great dinner. I had a pepper 16oz NY steak and it was quite amazing, cooked perfectly and just so great! Beautiful low/dim lighting and wonderful weighting staff. Cheap Valet and overall wonderful experience. And if you go, get the artichoke hearts stuffed with crab...to die for.",0
3318,6948,"Super pricey! I came here a few times with my boyfriends family and I don't think the food is that great. I've tried the salmon, the chicken with mushroom sauce (super nasty couldn't even eat it!). The only thing that was pretty good was the Chilean seabass.The place looks like scarface could have been filmed there. I don't think it's been remodeled since it opened.If you want to over pay for ok food and ok service this is your spot, but I wouldn't recommend it.",1
3319,6949,Called in a to go order and the service was spectacular.  This is my seond time to this place and it exudes class.  Vegas style class which is awesome!,1
3320,6950,"So guys night out brought us here....funny that Grace, my gf, would have loved it here too...but she's making me take her here once she heard the food was great....that said..Valet parking greets you with a long line of expensive cars to your right....the atmosphere is subdued like old school steakhouses are...Service is great of course and we were seated promptly.  Cheese bread is good, but the main entree was fantastic.  Ordered Bone In Rib eye.  It was flavorful and delectable.  It's topped with French fried Onions...perfect touch.  I almost ate it all but I thought I wanted dessert.  No one else wanted any so I passed.  All in all perfect..  I even got to meet Admiral Adama (Olmos)  there.  It was great. Valet: 3.50....Wine $10.00.....Old friends, Steak and Battlestar Galactica...priceless",1
3321,6951,"This place has good steaks. This place is ""old School"" You have to try it  for yourself.",1
3322,6952,this is our special occasion restaurant.. especially for anniversaries.the table side ceasar salad is soo good.. garlic-y but good.known for their steaks... i usually go for the new yorkand we split the chocolate souffle!! yummm!!old school charm...,0
3323,6953,"I love this restaurant. It's a diamond in the rough. I have worked in Huntington Park for years and finally I have found a close, safe place to get a fabulous drink, great dining and amazing live, relaxing music in the lounge. Will be back soon. You really feel like you are being waited on. Very refreshing after work. Please note, they only valet, YES!!!",0
3324,6954,"My first experience today. Our waitress was very pleasant & friendly. From the outside it doesn't look like much but once inside I found it to have a nice decor. A little pricey, but worth it. I had the ""breast chicken picata"" with zuchini. It was very good. My girlfriend had the ""chicken breast mushroom"" which was also very good. Though pricey, the portions are generous. We plan on going back to try some of their other dishes.",0
3325,6955,"what a great place, was a beautiful and classy set up. the service was outstanding and the food was delicious. I went with a party of 7, and our waitress was on top of everything with us. Price are a little up there, but when you get your food you diffidently get your money's worth. i will be back very soon.",1
3326,6956,"really great place.  throw back to 1965.  large comfortable booths, super nice staff..  american steakhouse fare with plenty of offerings on the menu.  wide selection of generously sized drinks...a good starting point.snack on the the relish tray and the amazing cheese toast, but don't fill up too much as the entrees are generous.  i had the poor man's pepper steak smothered in onions and greens, and asparagus on the side....simply great.  my friend had an excellent filet mignon.staff will not rush you, so take your time and enjoy.  good for couples, a double date, or a larger group.",0
3327,6957,Old style great place!  Big comfortable booths!  Great bar to wait in if you need to.  The food is worth waiting for!  The salad is tossed at your table. Who does that?  It adds to the ambiance and character of this place.  The food is impeccably delicious and you will wonder why you have not been here before!  It will become a family go to place!,1
3328,6958,"This is THE go-to place when vendors invite my team and I to dinner...presumably to seal the deal on negotiating new software purchases and to get me to sign off on exorbitant professional services fees...but who's complaining..and this is unspoken, of course. Everything is delish at this place and I always feel like I'm in the midst of 1960's rat pack swankiness. I expect Sinatra to turn the corner at any moment, smoking a cigarette and sipping a cocktail simultaneously...a skill I havent seen since my granddad was living. I don't eat beef but the boys always get steaks and I hear they are fantastic.  One must order their dessert souffle. Life is incomplete without trying one.",0
3329,6959,One of the best steak houses in Los Angeles. Old School!!!!,1
3330,6960,"Great service.  I ordered the pepper steak, which was a bit too peppery for my taste, but still excellent.  My husband ordered the lobster, and it was wonderful. Table side preparations were lovely. I will go back again for a special occasion.",0
3331,6961,"The filet pepper steak was phenomenal!  The bar was great too.  Expensive, but worth it.",1
3332,6962,"What can I say about the Dal Rae?  It is delicious!!!  The pepper steak is a must.  Other favorites are the ahi tuna appetizer, and rock shrimp appetizer.  I've tried the club sandwich once, the Grilled Americano sandwich once, the prime rib once, and the steak diane twice.  All were delicious.  Depite trying those dishes, I can't keep from ordering the pepper steak very often in the 15+ times that I have visted.The service is great and the atmosphere even better.  The servers are very knowledgeable and extremely friendly.  The owners are often roaming the dining room making sure everyone is happy.The bar area is also great, you can catch a game and sip on a super strong martini.  There is also a piano in the bar area and a one man band crooning on the weekends.  This is even a great place to start or end a great night out.  I've visited a few times with a groups of 12 or more and it was a great experience, although dinner for two is the best.  It's literally 2 blocks from my house earning extra points in my book.Hats off to the Dal Rae.",0
3333,6963,"This is a great romantic place to Igo to. They have absolutely the best Peppersteak of all-time here! They have really private booths with great customer service. This is the best steak place to go to in the area without having to trek into LA with all the congested freeway. It is a blast from the past seeing 60 year old guys with 25 year old women, haha.",0
3334,6964,"YUM! But I must warn you, you will leave completely stuffed!! Although it is not in the best part of town, the restaurant itself is nice. Reading these reviews before I went made me think I was going to some out of date place, but I actually really liked the decor and I'm in my early twenties. The atmosphere made it seem swanky and sophisticated. I got their sea bass ala ben, which was delish! Everything was great!",1
3335,6965,What can I say besides it was amazing!! We had a reservation so the wait was about 15 seconds...This place was pretty fancy and our waitress was soso not too nice or help full but can't complain we got out food in a timely manner. My boyfriend had the pepper steak which was delicious never knew steak could be so tender..lol.Definetly would dine there again,1
3336,6966,"The Dal Rea. Where do I begin with this place. For starters this isn't a place for every one, this is the place you go to spend some time with family or friends and not worry about how much you are spending. I'm sure you can manage on a budget but you are wasting your time. Cocktails are a must as you are greeted with bread and a cold veggie platter, next chop salad and oysters (always fresh), main course you can go many ways grilled fish a la ben is killer, but I have had a few steaks that are just as good, more drinks, then move on to dessert and after dinner drinks. I have never been to here and spent less than 3 hours dining.",0
3337,6967,"I love the dark atmosphere.  Although the prices are a bit high, it is worth every penny.  The food is amazing!  The seating is a little close.  It reminded me of dining in Paris where the tables are practically on top of each other.  This is sometimes awkward when you are able to hear personal conversations of the strangers you are seated next to.",1
3338,6968,The Dal Rae does not disappoint!  We had a good cross-representation of the menu with the seven adults in our party on Christmas Eve.  Every entree was top-notch and the atmosphere and service were impeccable!,0
3339,6969,"Old School.  One almost expects the Rat Pack to be resurrected.  Chilean Sea Bass is my go-to favorite, although there is nothing on the menu that will not knock your socks off. My only problem is that is gets sooooo crowded and they seems to squeeze tables so close together.  If I could give more than five stars, I would!!",0
3340,6970,"The appetizer was a tray with pickles, green onions, carrots, a mix of raw and pickled veggies over ice cubes, so i guess chilled veggies???? the water it seemed like it was straight from the faucet. I ordered fried calamari and, as I was fearing that I was going to leave hungry, they were undercooked like cold rubber while the crust was greasy and bland. I had better calamari at LAX for less than the $14 they charged at this place. They have a five star restaurant prices without the five star food and service. I returned the calamari and not going back.",0
3341,6971,"My family favorite for over 45 years! Always good!  - not sure about the dress, used to be nice, but now everyone wears everything. I would say mostly business attire.",1
3342,6972,"I never have written a review before but I am writing this reviewing because the experience I had Sept. 4, 2014 with the manager Kent at the Dal Rae, ruined my special occasion.  I was celebrating my 25 year work anniversary at the restaurant with my wife and boss.  The food and the service were great but the manager Kent acted very unprofessionally when I was inquiring about my cab.  I asked Kent if my cab was coming and instead of saying let me find out he gave me attitude and said I don't know did you order one and it only went down hill from there.  He came out a couple times offering his assistants, with his attitude, and would walk away saying derogatory things about me under his breath.  The final comment he made, under his breath, was holly s#_t and when I asked him for his card he refused to give me one because he said he did not have one so I asked him to write down his information for me and he continued to refuse to give me the information unless I gave him mine.  We spent over $500 there that night and I expected to be treated better than the way I was treated by the manager.  Clearly Kent should not be managing if he is going to be treating customers in a fine restaurant unprofessionally.  I have always had great experiences at this restaurant and that is why I went to celebrate this milestone in my life but needless to say I probably will not be returning.",0
3343,6973,Probably one of the best restaurants in the San Gabe Valley.  Top notch everything! Best tableside Casar Salad.....,1
3344,6974,"Had my parents retirement dinner there. (Yes, they both retired the same week). Marcy the hostess called me the day of to confirm our reservation and set aside a special table with black napkins in their garden room. Of course when we got there my wife found it too out of the way. When I approached Marcy about the change she obliged us and helped select another location. Wow. She personally handled the moving of the pre-opened bottles of wine and our personal items while we waited in the piano bar for the move. That's classy.My parents LOVE the Dal Rae and hadnt been there in quit awhile and now I assume less cause of the drop in income but what a night our server Helga wasOutstanding. She treated us like kings, yet not stand offish or just customers. She'd crack jokes on my dad and felt like one of the family. This place has been doin it right for over 50 years. Is still family owned and I haven't  even mentioned the food. Yum!  I'm a prime rib guy but the pepper steak Is to die for. Again. It's an awesome experience. After dinner we danced a lil in the bar with a few night caps. Overall. This place gets 10 stars.",0
3345,6975,"The Dal Rae has just become one of my favorite restaurants. It brings you back to a time when elegant tableside service was the norm for fine restaurants. The service is impeccable. The food is delicious. The cesar salad is served tableside and is done correctly with the original recipe ingredients. It's the best cesar salad I've ever had. The menu features many items that have unfortunately disappeared from many of today's menus - like Lobster Thermidor and Cherries Jubilee, which is also served tableside and was delicious.  I will be visiting Dal Rae many times in the future. It's a true culinary gem.",0
3346,6976,"It's like a scene from the Twilight Zone (old school) where you are in a horrible neighborhood and you walk into what appears to be a coffee shop on the outside. Then you are transported to an era where the waitstaff is beautiful and attentive, the linens are white and crisp and the food is superb. The good old days where the piano is softly playing in the background and the people are dressed up for dinner. I didn't see anyone in jeans nor shorts. That's for starters. Let me tell you about the meal. Wow! From the tableside Caesar salad to the perfectly cooked steaks and fresh shrimp, I was so hoping to have room for dessert since I heard about their amazing souffle. Next time! Cristina was our server and she was polite, attentive, helpful and happy to be there. Truly felt like old Hollywood minus the white dinner jackets and bow ties. I was surprised--Pleasantly. What a lovely gem of a place.",0
3347,6977,This is my wife & mine favorite restaurant.  The atmosphere is great. The steaks are better than Morton's or Ruth Chris especially the Pepper Steak is very unique.  The Caesar salad is made table side and is very authentic.  The Lobster Bisque soup is really smooth...and last the desserts are amazing.I highly recommend the Dal Rae!!!!:)))))),0
3348,6978,"Amazing dinner!! Great service, wonderful table side made Caesar salad! Delicious filet, no sauce needed! To die for grand mariner souffle! Great evening of food and service!!",1
3349,6979,Excellent service. The owner/host Lauren is always pleasant. I went on New Years eve and had a great time. The food was good too. I will have to give a 4 star because there was a hostess that was working the front and she had a bad attitude. She was an older blond lady and she was very unpleasant. I believe she is related to the owners.. I even told the waitress about her. Overall I love Dal Rae but this lady needs to change her attitude and be more welcoming....,0
3350,6980,"A great old school steak house with great food and a great staffI have been going here for about three years and was told by a friend who is a life long Angelino that it was the best steak house in town.  I am not sure if that is completely true, but it certainly comes close.  The food is top notch, the steaks very tender, the chicken moist and well seasoned.  The appetizers are simply great the the complementary crudetay(?) a welcome throwback to a simplier and classier times.  The service staff is friendly, knowledgeable and goes out of their way to make you welcome. I will return as often as I can...if were just a bit nearer toWest Los Angeles!",1
3351,6981,"Great environment, attentive servive, and food was excellent.  Best caesar salad and Steak Diane was perfect!  Definitely a ""go back"" for us again!!",0
3352,6982,My wife and I ate there last night. We both ordered filets cooked medium.  The steaks were nice and thick and looked great. They were both slightly overcooked.  Theywere tender but dry and tasteless.  The table side ceasar was the best part of the meal.  I think $6.95 for a glass of BudLight is ridiculous.,0
3353,6983,"First time at the Dal Rae and I was impressed.  The bartender made me the best vodka gimlet I have had in a long time.  Three in our party had the Petit Filet and they were very tender and cooked perfectly.  We all had deserts which were again, excellent. The dining room left a little to be desired and reminded me of a cafeteria.  Surprisingly, it was very quiet at the table and we had no problem conversing.Very good experience.",0
3354,6984,"I know Del Rae has been in service for quite a while now, and I'm sure there is a lot of frequent guest who the bartender and servers know very well.  But I have to say the two ladies doing the hostess job were not friendly at all.  But our dinner time was great!  Excellent food, friendly waitress, the music was great.  But all was done when we were done and walked out trough those doors again.  Both hostesses were standing there chatting with each other and I looked at both of them and they seemed to care less.  Not even a thank you?  I don't know, but I think the have been working at this restaurant for to long.Keep the waitress, the waiters, the guitar player, and the cooks, keep everybody.  But you have to do something about the two old birds taking care of that door.",1
3355,6985,Great food and service. Classy joint giving you that early 60's mob feel to it.,1
3356,6986,Great service and great food... The seafood was fresh and the steaks were tender,1
3357,6987,I expected better since it was my second time in a long time visiting this place.  The first time I had a Spinach salad that I loved.  But this time the grilled artichoke was way  underdone and didn't taste good.  The Chocolate Souffle we ordered was very lacking in chocolate. I was disappointed with the place since it gets so many good reviews.,0
3358,6988,very dissatisfied with their service :( took over an hour with a reservation made in advance! tried to make it up with an appetizer but I don't want anything for free! all I ask is for good service!,0
3359,6989,"I have been coming here for years, probably once or twice a year if that, for special occasions ( I do not have the income to visit as often as I'd like). Everything I get here is excellent and to my knowledge I have yet to be disappointed. The Prime Rib and King Crab Legs are my favorite go-to items. Its a beautiful establishment and very well kept, and even if you drive up to the valet in a Trailblazer or Camry, you never feel like you're ""less than"".  I like the little touches such as the fresh flowers on each table, the pickled veggie assortment and the fireplace when you first walk in and also since the recent updates, I am not sure if they still do this but at Christmas time the main dining room is decorated beautifully. The only thing I would be aware of (and this is just common sense) is that if you want a good table around any of the major holidays, it is wise to book extra early or book before or after the actual holiday because it gets crazy busy and you can guarantee you will most likely end up in the overflow room where (although the service remains the same) the atmosphere is quite different and you feel like cattle because they want as many patrons as possible.  Despite the location, this place is a must-go and probably one of a handful of reasons to even go to Pico Rivera, unless you live here or have family like I do :-)Highly Recommend!",1
3360,6990,i was told the dal rey was a mafia hangout a while back...,1
3361,6991,be patient if u visit this establishment! bring your american express! 15.00 margaritas! this place has many fooled its not what u think! seat yourself ask for  a menu! wait wait wait and i wont return!,1
3362,6992,"Had the exact same experience as Damon L. had on the 8th except I spoke with a different attendant. I get that I'm trying to book something last minute however a simple ""I'm sorry, we're fully booked that day"" would do the trick. Instead, she puts the phone down and I can hear her scoffing with someone else regarding my request. Out of the kindness of their little heart they decide to accomodate my group with a regular reservation which I would have appreciated had it not been for the blatantly rude and condecending tone in her voice. I don't have an issue with the fact that they weren't able to accomodate what we needed because I realize that this late in the game its a tough request, but there is absolutely no need to treat a potential customer like they are inconveniencing you with an inquiry. Based on customer service alone, we are taking our business elsewhere.",0
3363,6993,"Great ambiance ! I thought I may bump into Sinatra or Dean Martin. The place was hopping, tables were busy and the bar was crowded . Great piano lounge type of bar crowd . I had a presentation I did for a really nice group. I went with their popular pepper steak. Excellent!!",0
3364,6994,"I don't understand the big deal about this place, looks so old fashion & besides the decor, the food wasn't good at all, neither the food nor the bread nor the cocktails...... actually got sick from their nasty vodka & cranberry and the filet mignon was as hard as a rock.    The lobster thermidor wasn't very good either , terrible! i expected more, but then again its Pico Rivera",1
3365,6995,Generous portion with free vegetable pickles and cheese bread! Their prime rib is excellent the rib eye is okay.,1
3366,6996,Went last Thursday and got to say that yes the menu is not very adventuresome but you can definitely tell that the product was quality. I had the tuna  and my fiance had the pepper steak both were pretty fantastic and will definitely be back,0
3367,6997,"Ok I was excited to try this place Out. Been living here in Pico all my life never been.  So everything was great but the staff was kinda rude! We had a 5pm rsvp for Saturday and that's when they open.  They were still trying to put the place together when they opened the doors.  Our waitress was really frazzled the whole time.  We had a party of 9. It was kinda weird.  But then a door fell on top of the guy sitting in the booth Right next to us.  They escorted him out.  Calmed the scene.  And we waited for awhile maybe 30 min for our appetizers. .. then another 20 for our meal. Honestly maybe cuz I've idolized this place all my life I feel that was their only fault.  Food was awesome! I had rockafeller oysters. Bomb.  And the petite prime rib, awesome.   My bf had the pepper steak.  He loved that it actually came out medium rare.  Brother had fillet minigon.  Loved it.  Everyone's dishes looked awesome.  I want to try the Chilean seabass next time. cousin said it was awesome! Other than the service, everything was great.  Oh yeah one of the workers pulled in the driveway blocked valet cuz she locked her keys in the car cuz she must've been running late. . Lol",0
3368,6998,"Extremely disappointed with the food.  The Caesar salad was small and salty, the romaine pale to yellow, no green, and no freshly ground pepper.  The Morro Bay Abalone was without taste and reminded me of a bland, overcooked omelette with leathery lumps.  My guest's steak , ordered medium, was burnt black on the outside, bloody rare inside.  A wasted dining experience.",0
3369,6999,"Dal Rae is located in Pico Rivera, CA.  Couples, adults, young adults (who can afford it), very expensive, slow meal.  It is a medium-sized, classic, yet very dark and somewhat romantic restaurant that has been around since the 50's.  All tables have cloth, very clean silver wear, and glass trays of fresh vegetables on fresh ice.  That very smooth piano music is playing in the background.  All setting the tone for a very dark and mellow night.The Petite Fillet Pepper Steak- This steak is the best cut of meat in the whole world.  The second the waiter brings the steak to your table, your taste buds will be runnin wild.  When you go to cut into the cut of meat, it's like cutting butter that just came out of the microwave.  Once the meat enters your mouth, it melts like butter.  The meat is cooked perfectly to your choosing.  The intensity of the pepper and seasonings is enough to make you want to shove the rest in your mouth.  As it runs down your throat, you get the same feeling in your mouth as finishing a mouthful of breath mints.  There is nothing else like it.Fried Calamari- The calamari is fresher that fresh.  A perfect crunch of deep-fried batter, with the soft chewy texture of the calamari in your mouth.  The crunch you make when biting into the piece is the way it sounds on a TV commercial, just perfect.  Also the spicy marinara and lemon butter sauce also packs a punch when chewing it up in your mouth.Caesar Salad- One of Dal Rae's most fun table-side dishes to watch being prepared.  The server makes it all in front of you.  Ass they toss in the salad, dressing, croutons and cheese, you get hungrier and hungrier by the second.  As you taste it, you make out the cold texture, with the fresh condiments.  The whole thing together is a fresh, tangy and explosive flavor that makes you want to eat it all over again.Yes!!  This is truly a one of a kind experience.  A classic 50's restaurant that carries on its old tradition throughout the years.  Sometimes the old places are the best.",0
3370,7000,"Superb all around was our experience here last night! My husband and i visited the Dae Rey at the suggestion of my boss, this place is his favorite spot for good quality food, with great service at reasonable prices. We celebrated our 25 th wedding anniversary yesterday and this was the perfect spot. I rank the Dae Rey up there with Mastros- yep it was that good if not better! I took pictures of our entrees with my phone but bcus of lighting the pictures didnt do justice, so i cant post. You have to go and experience for yourself, you will not be disappointed. I can actually eat here every night that just how much we loved it. We were a bit relunctant bcus of the area- a nice fine dining in Pico Rivera? Dont be fooled! I had the chealean sea bass and my husband had 10oz steak. We shared the ceasar salad and devoured the cheese bread- we are not big bread eaters,- cheese bread?!?! Heart attack! But nope not this one... it was great. Dessert was awesome as well.. u cant go wrong with any of the food,sides and dessert! Just go and see for yourself- nuf said!",0
3371,7001,"It sure feels like the 1960s if you are a ""colored"" person. I was surprised I was able to dine with the white-Americans. The waitress assumed my party was here for a celebration such as a birthday. Why else would a group of Latinos dine at a steakhouse that wasn't Sizzler? I noticed that our party wasn't the only one to receive such a comment (the young Latinos at the next table did happen to be there for a birthday) yet the parties with middle-aged white Americans didn't receive the same comment. This place is definitely overrated. Although the crème brulee did take the bitter taste of racism out of my mouth. Some things should have stayed in the 1960s.",0
3372,7002,"it seems they have lost that loving feeling, last week made reservations for two they put me in the patio , they had smokers. we asked the waitress to move she asked the smokers to stop. uhmm they did for a minute. By the time she came back after more than one attempt to get bussers to ask her to come, she showed... we asked for check.....finally we got up went to hostess offered ten bucks for water and relish tray and left. so in few words super busy overbooked lousy service. this was second time we received bad service at those prices we wont be back after many years and hundreds of dollars",1
3373,7003,"Had a great time at Dal Rae . Eva was our waitress and did a super job . Very attentive . The Wilted Spinach salad with warm bacon dressing prepared tableside was insane and can easily be split to cut the calories . Sautade mushrooms very good and are enough for 4 people . Banana flambe prepared tableside is over the top and is quite the show .  Sea bass a la ben and Halibit a la ben both great and I am not even a fan of halibit . Took half home and made fish tacos the next day . Mom loved the Pepper Steak - Pettite Filet ( 10 oz ) . But I thought it was too spicy - so be careful . You might want to split the Pepper steak with a milder dish with your partner . 12 oz .Lobster out of this world with great presentation .  Onion Soup a meal by itself with the complimentary garlic cheese bread . Two beers , Two glasses of wine , One cocktail and two club sodas for our 5 party , Five Coffees and Two Banana Flambes for our 5 party and the bill was about $ 425. So bring your appetite and money . portions are large . Some reviews complained about the service bit Eva was really good and friendly - so I guess its the luck of the draw .",0
3374,7004,"Came here on last day of Dine LA. I have been here before for regular menu and previous Dine LA events. Grew up in Pico and my parents came here for years. Love the food, and the throwback steak house feeling of the place. I made my reservation online for first time partially because I have made phone reservations before and the woman who I've dealt with on the phone tends to be short with you and rude. Made an early reservation knowing that it would be crowded on a weekend especially during Dine LA. So reservation was for 5 and restaurant opened at 5. Got there a little early and surprisingly it was open (other occasions they do not open doors until exactly 5). So I walk in with my fiancé and there are two women at the hostess desk and my fiancé sees the couple we are meeting at the bar and brings it to my attention but I don't want to ignore the hostesses and just walk by them so I tell them ""hi we have a reservation for 4 at 5:00pm, but we are a little early"" (it was about 4:45) and the rude old lady hostess who I know I've talked to on the phone before says in a sarcastic tone, ""well yeah they're right over there!!"" Motioning towards the bar! Rude, rude, rude! Needs to retire or find a new job! Server was sweet, and great as was everyone else in the restaurant. My steak was awesome and my fiancé loved the lamb. Just stay away from that old lady hostess!!",1
3375,7005,"Dal Rae is just an average steak house but with a real old school look and feel.   I decided to check this place out after seeing all the great reviews on Yelp.   There's nothing really special about this place.  It was neat watching the waiter make the Ceasar salad table side, but it wasn't that great of a salad.    The salad was way too oily and the dressing as a bit strong on the anchovy paste.  As for the steak (I ordered the filet)...it was avg.  It was cooked to perfection but lacked taste.  The green onion topping was good but there was just too much and at times seemed overpowering.  As for the sides, nothing special at all, you would find the same quality at Black Angus.  Service to me is just as important as the food.  I'd have to rate the service as average.  The waitress was knowledgeable about the menu but it took a while for her to get things to us (food, drinks, bill, etc).  I understand it was bit busy the night we were there but 5 min for our drinks, over 10 min for the bill, and she only came by our table once throughout the whole meal.  For the price I'd rather go to BOA, Houston's or Banderas.  I'd say  give this place a try if you're in the area and looking for a decent steak but I'd advise against driving all the way out there just for this place.",0
3376,7006,"Romantic, intimate, and Mad Men-ish the Dal Rae is a complete dining experience with impeccable service. I have no doubt that everything on the menu is delicious. The scallops were fantastic!",0

3378,7008,"Dal Rae has definitely impressed us tonight! Great food, great service and definitely a fair price. The fried calamari was delicious but needed salt. The spaghetti with meat sauce was good and the veal parmigiana was fantastic. Make sure you save room for their garlic bread with your meal. Sorry no photos, we were too busy eating!",0
3379,7009,The food was delicious and service was excellent. This is definitely one of my favorites in the area! I will be back!,1
3380,7010,"Hmmm...where should I start? Exterior of the restaurant does not look like a fancy restaurant. Interior looked and felt like a family restaurant...it was nice and dim. When we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by an elderly lady. She lead us to our table. FAST FORWARD....our kind server gave us complimentary  vegetables on ice (which was weird  to me because it didn't really go with anything) and bread and chips that were cold (I like my bread warm). They also gave us garlic cheese bread (It was warm!). We ordered escargot and although it tasted pretty good, it was luke warm. So sent it back to the kitchen and had them warm it up. We ordered the famous peppered steak - petite new York prime and bone in ribeye for our entrees. Although tasty, temperature of the steaks were not quite hot, rather luke warm, just like the escargot. Finally the chocolate souffle was just AOK, not impressive. For the price we paid, it needs to be better. Maybe they should invest in a new oven. The only thing that made my dinner enjoyable and delicious was my husband. We were there to celebrate Valentine's Day on Presidents day. Honestly I don't know how to rate it.",0
3381,7011,This place has to be a sin. A fine dining restaurant shouldn't exist in Pico but this place is a hidden diamond. I've come here several time on company outings and just amazing palette pleasing experiences every time. I've tried many of the apps and the pepper steak which is my favorite dish. If you're in the area it is worth it to check this place out.,0

3383,7013,"Where to begin...I actually commented on their FB page first, of course there wasn't a reply.  We came the day after Christmas for a late lunch/early dinner.  This was my first time, so it was on my bucket list.  I had had prime rib for Christmas dinner, so I was more interested in trying the seafood.  First of all, the wait staff not so helpful, had to wait quite a while just to order a drink.  Crab cakes, my favorite appetizer, weren't crispy and were mushy on the inside, the calamari was good, not rubbery and the right amount of crunch.  I tried the Sand Dabs, I'm a fan of capers, seriously, it's like they sprinkled them on top of the fish straight from the jar, hello, capers are to be rinsed well to get rid of the salty, vinegar.  Mashed potatoes, hmmmm, could have been instant.  Chocolate Souffle, wow, the worse ever.  Seriously, the waitress poked a hole in it and poured what looked like warmed up Hershey's syrup, yeah I'm use to poking my own souffle and savoring the chocolate ganache.  Definitely overpriced!  My family and I won't be back...EVER!",1

3385,7015,"My husband and I were very pleased with the food and service here.  It was a company party so we had the room off to the side with plenty of space.  I noticed the main dining areas, around the bar area was jam packed and hard to get to the restrooms!  We had an excellent experience though it took a while before the entree came out.  Our Caesar salad was good but way too much dressing and salty.  My Chilean sea bass was excellent and a huge portion compared to Tap's!  Yummy potatoes and veggies. Creme brulee was the best I've tasted--perfect and not so rich you had to limit yourself from getting sick.  It took the dessert quite some time to come out. We had a party of 25-30 so that is hard to manage.  I can see the complaints of those in the dining area.  It seems to be a place where you have time and can linger over good conversation and good food.  Not good if you want to eat and leave.  I would definitely go back but hope I'm not disappointed.  I heard the prime rib was delicious..the large portions seemed very appealing.  Our waitress was very efficient, attentive and courteous.",0
3386,7016,"I would have given this place 3 stars, but ultimately I have to take another star away for the outrageous prices. $60 for Alaskan King Crab legs when you can get them for $35/$40 a dozen other places? Come on. We had the grilled artichoke, the fried calamari, oysters, white clam chowder, sashimi on toast, and the veal oscar. The people that I brought here from the Midwest complained of having stomach cramps all night after eating here, which definitely should not be the case after dropping a couple hundred dollars for dinner. The oysters were actually very fresh, but pricey. Those were probably the best thing we ate. The grilled artichoke was nothing special, but I liked the dipping sauces they provided. The fried calamari was super meh, not very fresh at all and kind of chewy. The clam chowder was okay taste wise, but had a weird consistency. Kind of watery. The sashimi seemed fresh but didn't personally like the feta and toast with it. Cheesy fish is a weird combo in my opinion. Noted. The veal oscar was probably the least successful dish of the night along with a very blah salad. The taste was off and is what probably contributed to my guest's discomfort that night (I'll save you the gorey details). Valet is $4.50, which I didn't mind so much but the prices overall for the food that did not at all live up to the standards of this LA ""staple"" is what left the worst taste in our mouths. Ya know, besides that veal. Will probably not be returning.",0
3387,7017,I have been going to Dal Rae for number of years now and I've always had a wonderful experience service wise and food wise.  But four of us went yesterday to celebrate our birthdays and i'm so sad to say it was a really bad experience...The corkage fee for my $17 bottle of wine was $20 which I found to be ridiculous.  Our salads were made with the white part of the iceberg lettuce that is the least flavorful and healthy. The service was extremely slow between courses.  I had informed both the front desk gal as well as our waitress that we were celebrating four birthdays -- that we do this once a year at that same restaurant and the waitress even said to us I remember you guys!!! But no birthday desserts came ... we must've sat there for 30 minutes before asking about them and one small piece of chocolate cake was brought finally by a waitress I didn't recognize. I asked where is our waitress? and was told oh! she went home!  our main courses were delicious but I'm not sure it made up for the horrible experience overall. We may be choosing another restaurant next year...,0
3388,7018,it was alright...the food was deliscious but a long wait even with my reservation....and they were degrading to there waiters and they charged me twice which let to me not being able to pay my phone bill for a few days which is the  main problem...bit if ur a rich white person they'll serve u right away so u shouldn't have problem...,1

3390,7020,"What a great experience! We did or company christmas party here, the staff is great! we were seated quickly, and service was great. we ordered some calamari and a couple of shellfish platters. everything was fantastic.

We ordered the coffee ice cream, cheesecake, and creme brulee. there was also a live singer who was fantastic! the atmosphere was great with the christmas decorations artfully placed around the room. the tables were spaced out nicely and we had plenty of room separating us from other parties. Anyone trying to claim minorities are mistreated here must have had a rare experienced, or they were misjudging the situation, 75% of our party was hispanic and most of the staff was as well. we were all treated with the up most respect and our service was fantastic.

3392,7022,"First, let me say that the service was super, and the restaurant, although old, was nicely furnished. However, my Christmas duck was overcooked and the meat was tough. The sauce was an Au Jus Gravy and not very interesting. The small potatoes seemed to be an afterthought. The wedge salad with Blue Cheese Dressing was Okay, but plain. The Fried Calamari was just not good. It was cooked to a brown color instead of a very pale golden. The lemon sauce was Okay but not very interesting. That said, the house wine was nice and they allow you to take your time eating without disturbing you. My company at dinner was wonderful, so I did not get too bothered by the food. The prices are high considering the quality of the fare, and some attention should be paid to getting it down right. My only complaint about the staff was a waitress that bumped my chair every time she took a shortcut to her table in the next section. It happened so many times that it became a joke between me and my guest.",0

3394,7024,"I've dined at the Del Rae on multiple occasions and they deliver every time. This place remains one of my favorite steak houses in the Los Angeles area. The restaurant is located in the middle of Pico Rivera, a misfit among restaurants in this area. You may be pleasantly surprised to find this romantic, local hot spot as you enter the dark dining room. You'll quickly forget you're in Pico Rivera. I always have a challenging time deciding what to order, but nevertheless start off with a great Caesar Salad and sliced anchovies. I love their New York Pepper Steak, which is their signature dish. I also crave their Sea Bass, which is prepared ""a la ben"" in parmesian cheese. They also prepare it with lemon butter, and cajun style. This is a a generous portion of white, flaky fish. If you really want to go all out, you can't go wrong with their Australian Lobster Tail, which is absolutely delicious. Save room for dessert and try the Banana Flambe, which is prepared table side. FINAL VERDICT: Food 4/5...predictable place with quality food. Service 4/5.....very nice and attentive. Ambiance 4/5....dark dining room with an adjacent piano bar filled with multiple tv screens.",1
3395,7025,I adore this place and I visit when I am in the area visiting friends.  The ambience is hard to beat and the throwback food and vibe is nice.,1
3396,7026,"Yummy! I have never had a bad meal here. Everything is always great. Prime rib, fish and steak are all wonderful. The crowd is a little bit older and the booths may age you a bit but it's worth the time warp. I always get the sea bass a la Ben, salad and garlic toast. Yumm!!!",1
3397,7027,"I came here for the first time today. I enjoyed the old school dimly lit interior. Our waitress was ok. Not great and not the worst. Just ok. They offer lots of bread. And then when you've eaten the bread they bring... More bread... Cheese bread, to be exact.  It's easy to get full before the entree comes. I had the Seabass alla ben. The fish itself was nicely prepared. But it had onions on it.  Which sounded good, but in reality don't go so well with fish.  And the sauce on the plate was too heavy and had a cloying quality.  My friend ordered one of the peppered filets they are famous for. Neither he or I liked the preparation. We agreed a good piece of beef does not need to be doctored up to be enjoyable. As soon as the food hit the table the waitress was there pushing the dessert soufflés. I realize they take time to prepare, but pushing dessert on me before I've eaten my entree always turns me off.  My friend agreed to the chocolate soufflé. It was below average. If you're a fan of dimly lit, old school, restaurants that serve martinis and beef at high prices, give it a try.",0

Ordered vin and oil got Italian waitress stated there the same even though listed separately waitress curtly walked  away. Don't  bother with the lobster bisque it is only bisque . Martinis were thankfully  strong altho no olive or onion. When inquired waitress stated you need to ask. All that was forgivable somewhat but what was sad was the lobster tail. Was overcooked and dry.  Very disappointed  times two this last time the worst. Saw owner I think he's on skates flew by so fast. So sad we loved it here but now we are done.",0

I was very disappointed but I didn't realize it until a group sat right next to us who was also celebrating their 49th wedding anniversary.  Our server was nice and professional, but thats something I can get at chili's for 1/3 of the price.  Their server, on the other hand was, ON-IT:  friendly, offered specials, asked if they were celebrating anything, was super sweet and attentive (the type of service WE expected). Our server was nice but I couldn't help but notice that the table next to us (four older Caucasian people, very nice) got WAAAYYY better service and attention than we did (1 Latino couple ).  I am not hyper sensitive to race/culture/language but I cant help but look at it when it stairs me in the face. There were only 3 other tables being used at the restaurant at the time (not busy). Food was good. ambiance was beautiful.",0
3404,7034,Fantastic  food! Try. I dont think you will be disappointed.,1
3405,7035,"Not something you would expect! You wouldn't really expect this restaurant to be the way it is just from looking on the outside (never judge the book by its cover). The food here was pretty good for the price. I've have eaten here for both dinner and lunch. At lunch time it seems like the working people like the directors, managers, management such as the CFOs/CEOs eat here as most people are wearing ties/blazers/dresses and talk about business. At night time it seems more relaxed and laid back as dressy people come out to enjoy a nice dinner. I would not have expected this place to be how it, definitely a hidden gem in the area. I enjoyed the food each time I've been here. When Dine L.A. comes around it is usually on there and is definitely worth the visit.",0

The bar area is a dark, cozy place to start out the evening and their lemon drops and martinis are excellent. The main dining room is large with comfortable, spacious booths. This is one of those places where you get service with flair (dramatic unveiling of dishes, etc.). Everything that I've had here has been delicious.",0
3407,7037,"This place has the best oyster's rockefeller in the world. You will never go wrong with a their famous pepper steak. it's so different from your average pepper steak. If you are going to have dessert, I highly suggest the table side preparation of the bananas flambe.",1
3408,7038,The best thing about my trip to El Monte was a short trip to this Sammy Davis Jr. Hang out. Went with clients and had a great time and great food.,1
3409,7039,Great place! First class all the way and awesome food! You really feel like you were transported back in the 60's when you pull up to this place and expect to see the Rat Pack at the bar with Sammy D telling a joke to all the enamoured customers gathered around. Love this place!!!!,1
3410,7040,"We went  to the restaurant on a personal recommendation for our 25th anniversary and was very disappointed.  The restaurant felt very claustrophobic.  I felt like were right on top of the table next to us.  Also, there was a person in wheel chair leaving and he could barely get through between the tables.  I will not return to this restaurant.",1
3411,7041,took the familia got pepper steak and escargot kids stil talk about it nice setting  great food good service  if you go here get the pepper steak !!!!,1
3412,7042,When we first walked  in the people at the front desk ignored us. Bad first impression. But our waitress was just wonderful. and so was the ambiance and food. Best Caesar salad yet.We ate too much bread before dinner. So ended up taking most of the main meal home.Cant wait to go back. This no bread.,0
3413,7043,"I've been coming here since the mid 70s and it's great to visit a restaurant that's retained its original qualities and charm, although it's lost some of its sharpness with age.Odd retro modernist architecture on the outside.  Clubby 60s cozy on the inside, in the middle of an unlikely industrial area in Pico Rivera.  Their great classic continental menu is mostly unchanged from years past and features old cherished recipes like we used to see, prepared in a manner seldom used today in ""make it quick"" restaurants.  Classics such as Caesar salad, Steak Diane or Bananas Foster (flambé) all prepared tableside, are excellent.  Unfortunately, this style of preparation can mean pretty long waits to get your various courses served on busy evenings.  They still use top quality fresh ingredients with few shortcuts, which means prices are pretty high, but where else can you order things like Lobster Thermador, frog legs sauté, or Morro Bay Abalone.  Some of my favorites are the Oysters Rockefeller, crab stuffed mushrooms, the Dal Rae chopped salad, and their petite filet pepper steak, all fabulous.The bar is separated from the dining room and has its own ambiance, clubby and comfortable, and the barmen pour generous, albeit pricey drinks.  The restaurant seems to draw primarily an older crowd who enjoy the style they experienced in the good old days (like me).One major caution - this is a large restaurant and their procedures for service and food prep can be a challenge for the kitchen and the servers.  When the restaurant is very busy they get overwhelmed and delays and mistakes seem more commonplace than in years past .  For that reason, I would suggest diner reservations on a week night or very early on Fri or Sat nights to improve the odds of a great dining experience.",0

3415,7045,"I have always had fabulous service here, but my last server was the best: she goes by M & M. FABULOUS!!!! She gives so much personal attention.The Dal Rae is my go-to place for pepper steak. No one does pepper steak like them.the Dal Rae is like your old, classic, traditional steak house. cocktails are great. Made to perfection. Relish tray is a great start to a fabulous meal. the cheese bread and baked potaoes with their cheese sauce are scrumptious. the pepper steak comes with a mixture of bacon, pepper, and green onions ... So delicious, so be sure to ask for extra. I usually share the brittle sundae with my friends, but this last time tried the grand marnier souffle. the best ever!!!!Yes, the Dal Rae is expensive, but definitely worth those special occasions. and, the entrees come with a potato and vegetable.It is also nice hearing the music overflow from the bar area. when making reservations, be sure to ask for the main dining room.",0
3416,7046,"One of my all time faves! Love their Lobster - always cooked to perfection. A bit pricey, but worth it! Even the small one is great to share. The Crudite basket is an old time touch that you never see at other upscale steak houses. Garlic bread is a little oily/buttery but decadent. Love the Steak Tid-Bits on appetizer menu as well as their Peppered Steak -SO GOOD! I recommend this place for a nice romantic dinner (ask for a booth) or a celebratory event with a large party and of course, everything in between.",0
3417,7047,Worth every dollar! Great quality food and service. Everytime I go there I tell myself I am going to try something new but end up ordering the Chillean Sea Bass every time! It is absolutely wonderful!  I am going there again tomorrow and am looking forward to it.,0
3418,7048,"After reading some of the reviews, I was compelled to write one. This place is AWESOME if you expect expensive, quality food, and a ""nice"" meal. It's definitely not a hot trendy restaurant with a hopping bar. This is the elegant dinner place where you're going to get what you paid for. My family as well as my husband's family have been coming here since we were kids. We have taken our own children here since they were young (now they are 13-22.) It is not a kid friendly place as it's pricy, dark, and formal, but our kids consistently asked to go back over and over for their special birthday dinners. They learned to eat Escargot and Oyster Rockerfeller here.They do only have valet but for a few dollars, it's worth it. We NEVER had a problem in the approx. 38 years.As for the food, my favorite is the filet peppersteak and it has never failed me. Always cooked to my liking. Only once I had to send it back for a bit more heat. I order it med-rare and it is recommended to order no more than medium. Other favorites are: tableside ceasar salad, hearts of romaine salad, spinach salad, chilean sea bass with lemon butter, garlic spinach, crab stuffed mushrooms, and tableside banana flambe. The family enjoys the oyster rockerfeller, escargot, shrimp cocktail, and the onion crusted chilean sea bass.The service can be slow on a busy night, but this is not the type of meal you should expect to be fast. It's meant to enjoy the company you are with and the food at a slower pace. And, although it might be slow, they will attend to almost anything you ask for. If you don't want an ingredient in a dish, just ask!Over our 26 years of marriage, we still compare the food at other ""nice"" restaurants to the Dal Rae. We do find great places, but we will always return here for our favorite items.",0
3419,7049,"I thought the food was good. The tables in the main dining room are so close together, too close for me.  Our server was arrogant, seemed like she has been there forever and not that sincere.  Overall ok.",1
3420,7050,impressive service and very welcoming. ambiance nice and fancy with touch of hip.delicious foods. we had steak and salmon. love all the free brads and vegetalbe plate.,0
3421,7051,"One of the best restaurants in LA.  The food is much higher quality than the ""fancy"" places on the westside that charge an arm and a leg, and you get large portions.",1
3422,7052,I come here often. Everything is delicious!!! Best peppered steaks. Love the pickled veggies. My all time favorite is the chocolate Martini. They are not stingy with the alcohol.,0
3423,7053,"It was pretty crowded for a Tues night.  Service was very good.  Chilean seabass, bone-in ribeye and bananas flambe were all outstanding.  Fried calamari was good but not outstanding.  We hadn't been there for a while but it's still excellent.",0
3424,7054,"Was there last night 8/24/2012 had the best Chateaubriand, We started with the Wilted Spinach Salad, that was great, & ended with Grand Marnier Souffle. every thing was great. Service was excellent,  maitre'd / owner Kevan Smith plated our diner table side, & talked with us & put on show, did a great job, The waitress "" Dora"" was the finest we have had in long time on over lapping. This place is ""Old Time School"" Dates back to the late 50's the service is from the 60's when ""service was service"" its not cheap but it was well worth the time & money. I will be going back again & again.",0
3425,7055,Having been dining at The Dal Rae for over 20 years and it never fails. If you love Pepper Steak this is the place.,1
3426,7056,"Sorry to say the meat was not great quality, and the sauce was overpowering.  The Caesar salad was great and the drinks were well poured, but the steak wasn't good enough to warrant the drive.  Very good baked potatoes.",0
3427,7057,"i love this place!!!great food--great atmosphere!you have to try the pepper steak, its the best!!!very romantic, great service!!",1
3428,7058,"very delicious steaks, cooked to perfection every time! What i like about this place is that they are always consistent with their service and their food.",0
3429,7059,"We have eaten here many times and it was always wonderful. However, our Mother's Day experience was ruined by the hostess. We arrived on time for our reservation but were told there would be a wait. No problem, we thought, it's Mother's Day. While waiting we could see the hostess's desk.  1, 2, 3, 4 parties came in and were seated. My husband complained and the next thing we know they have a table for us Not in the dining room, but in a side porch next to a party of 17!  We then told the hostess that that seating was not acceptable. She put up her hand as if to say ""talk to the hand"" and walked away.  My son in law spoke to the manager about this treatment and ask what could possibly be  going on?  He apologized and we were seated within 10 minutes in the main dining room.  The meal was excellent, as always. However, the experience was ruined and we're still not sure why. I was personally embarrassed for my family and the two wonderful mothers in our group as well as two precious grandsons who never complained about this totally unacceptable behavior.  We can never go back, no matter how good the food is.  This slight was personal and we will never know why.",0
