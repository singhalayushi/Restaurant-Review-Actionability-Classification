0,"We have been going to Dal Rae for many years. Never disappointed. However this visit was a very different experience.
First of all, the hosts were very accommodating. They sat us within 15 minutes although we arrived 45 minutes before our reservation time.
We were sat at the bar area. From the very beginning we felt like our server was rushing us to order. We ordered two pomegranate margaritas and it didnât taste like what we expected. So we asked to return it and got two glasses of Merlot instead. We can tell our server was not happy about it from her facial expression. We finished our food and we need some to go boxes. The bus person came and took our plates away in very rush manner and didnât even ask us where the untouched baked potato goes. He rushed the food to the packing area, packed and brought them back. We felt like we were rushing to leave the restaurant but it was only 9PM.
During our dinner, we had this couple sitting next to us. Apparently they were either old staffs or long time customers. Almost everyone in the restaurant came greet them. They were so loud that at one point we have to talk louder than them so they realized they were loud.
We clearly didnât enjoy our evening.",0,0,0,0,0
1,"Very mediocre at best. Many other restaurants I can spend $350.00 and get much better all around. Better food, better service, better ambiance. Very disappointing, save your money and go elsewhere.",1,1,1,1,1
2,"Have been dining here at least once or twice a year for about 30 years.
Decided to go in for lunch to get the traditional Shrimp Louie I had been craving.
Was so disappointed to see it was now made with shredded lettuce and small rock shrimp. Not at all what it used to be!
My niece got the Medallions of Filet it should have been described as a medallion of fillet.   
Maybe it was just going in for lunch service, even the wait staff was not up to usual standards.
Sorry to say not sure if Iâll ever go back.
Wish they would just raise the prices and keep the quality of both the food and staff.",0,0,0,0,0
3,"This was Valentine's Day, and we were looking forward to our dinner. It was a big disappointment ,the service was slow, food didn't come out in a timely manner, and we were rushed, we will never return for one of these prefix menus again. We really like this place it has always been top service and great food. Hopefully, this was just a bad day.",0,0,0,0,0
4,"Iâve been coming to Dal Rae for years. I wanted to have Galentines dinner with my close girlfriends, so I booked the place. We sat at the bar while we waited for our party to arrive. The bartender was excellent and Efficient. We sat at our table, and the service went downhill from there. The server took forever to greet us and get our drinks. He offered to tell my friends the main dishes because it was their first time there. He forgot half the speech. We never got our drinks, we had to ask for service multiple times. Other parties were fed and waited on and left before we got our food. We were seated under an AC vent, and asked to have it lowered because it made our food cold. We had to wear our jackets for the same reason. We ordered a bottle and it took an hour to get to us. Our reservation was for 8:30 and we didnât leave till 11:45 because of the poor service. By the time we got to dessert everything was gone. Such a huge disappointment because Dal Rae is known for quality service and food.",0,0,0,0,0
5,"WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PLACE NOW? SERVICE WAS BAD(HOSTESS GAVE US TWO HOURS TO EAT SHE SAID SO!
FOOD ORDER WAS WRONG. RECEIVED BOOLD RARE STEAK. ORDER IT MED. WELL DONE!
HOSTESS TOOK IT BACK BECAUSE THE SERVER WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!
CHEF DELIVERED SECOND STEAK WITH NO FORK TO EAT WITH. I HAD TO SCREAM FOR A FORK? WHAT???
MANAGER APOLOGIZED, BUT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME.
I DROPPED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF COIN IN THIS PLACE OVER THE LAST 35+ YEARS, WHEN THE MANAGEMENT WAS DIFFERENT AND BETTER. NEW PEOPLE ARE $$$ HUNGRY AND THE RESTAURANT IS SUFFERING. NO RELISH TRAY ANYMORE, GIANT PLATE WITH LITTLE BITTY AMOUNTS OF FOOD THAT COST AN ARE AND A LEG.
LASTLY THE VALET TOOK HIS TIME RETRIEVING OUR VEHICLE, IN THE COLD, WE WAITED AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES, SHIVERING THE WHOLE TIME!!!
ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO TEN, I GIVE YOU A FOUR(4).
USED TO RATE THIS PLACE A TEN(10). NOT WITH NEW OWNERS THOUGH.
MANAGER SHOULD HAVE COMPT MY DINNER AT LEAST, NO, ONLY TWO DRINKS COMPT, BIG DEAL.
THIS WAS MY WOMENS 67th BIRTHDAY!
SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HER TO Lawrys. BETTER SERVICE AND FOOD.
I WILL NOT BE BACK TO THIS RIP=OFF HUT AGAIN!!!

9,"I went to this location expecting something comparable to water grill since the pricing was relatively the same and let me tell you that it was a miserable disappointment! Sat at the bar and got drinks to start the night and my old fashion was made incorrectly and my girlfriendâs margarita was grapefruit water. Moved over to be seated and they were nice to replace the table cloth since it was dirty. And then we split a salad and ordered the angel hair pasta with a custom request of having it with shrimp. The salad was good, pretty basic but did the job. The pasta was overtly buttered and there was 5 shrimp per pasta dish. To my amazement, each pasta dish went from $20 ea. to $43 because of 5 shrimp LOL what a scam! We could have gotten chilean sea bass for $10 more. Never going to this location again and even the valet didnât give me the correct amount of cash back. Do better!!",0,0,0,0,0
10,"Wait staff was very helpful and kind. Unfortunately the food was generic and not prepared well enough. There was nothing special or memorable about neither the food nor the drinks. It's hard to say all this about a place where the staff was SO friendly, but the food and drinks were LESS desirable than a typical restaurant. The best food was the two sides ordered. I expected much more originality. Especially from the cocktail menu (even Chili's has their own signature cocktails, why not Dal Rae?). $200 for 2 is better spent elsewhere, like The Cellar in Fullerton.

Food ordered:
Cesar salad for 2
Filet Mignon w/ rice pilaf
Pork Chop w/ mashed potatoes
Drinks ordered:
Dark 'n' Stormy (hard to mess up this classic drink but somehow it was not good)
Cucumber lime Martini",0,0,0,0,0

15,LOBSTER THERMIDOR SINCE THEY LOST THEIR KEY CHEF IS HORRIBLE THE LAST TWO TIMES I HAVE GONE!!!! Have gone all my life over 50 years. Will not be returning as it was that bad and soup was cold! Unfortunate as management does t really care either,1,1,1,1,1
16,"Made the mistake dining close to closing time - baked potatoes were old, error on order.  Ordered filet mignon, server brought out filet mignon with pepper sauce.  They took back the plate, removed the sauce, placed on the grill and sent back.  It was full of pepper......  Sent back to the kitchen.

(1) Should never have ""cleaned up' the filet mignon.  Should not have been done in the first place.  
(2) Should not serve old food that is reheated, especially a baked potato.

Disappointing.... which begs the question.... did they think our party didn't know any better????????????",0,0,0,0,0
17,"I've eaten at Dal  Rae before and enjoyed it.  This visit was a huge disappointment.  I was with a party of seven friends celebrating our yearly  gift exchange.  It's always a fun time.  However, this dinner was so miserable everyone couldn't wait to leave.  They placed our table near an open side door.  As we were sitting down, we all immediately complained that it was very cold.  The hostess explained that they had to leave the door open because they were serving on the patio.  She went on to explain that the heater placed was placed near the door to keep us warm.   As the restaurant was full, we accepted it.  The heater did nothing to warm the interior of the restaurant near our table.  We got colder.  By the end of the night, we were all popsicles.  Half of our food was cold the other half lukewarm.  We waited 1 1/2 hours for our food to arrive.  We were so cold and fed up that most of the food was packed to go. Our repeated complaints went ignored until it was time to go.  The manager offered to take care of it on our bill.  His idea of taking care of it was reducing our bill by about 30%.   This is an event that my friends and I look forward to every year for the past 10 years especially since we were unable to get together in person last year.  We were so disappointed...  We will definitely not take our event to Dal Rae again. The reduction in the bill, in no way made up for the numb feet and hands while sitting at a dinner table zipped up to our necks in coats. Or how our waiter and hostess tried to pretend we weren't freezing. That they were so busy that they did not offer another table or that our food, when it finally came was cold.",0,0,0,0,0
20,The service was good but we had to send back our drinks because they were so bad. All of our meals with steak were cooked incorrectly and unevenly so we ended up having to trade amongst ourselves at the table. Overall disappointing as the food here used to be consistently good.,0,0,0,0,0

22,"I've eaten at this restaurant on many occasions, but this past time I was not impressed with the food and service, our food was wrong and it was cold, from the time we sat down to the time we finished our dinner it was 3 frustrating hours, I understand we're going through some rough times with Covid-19, but if we're trying to help our local restaurants I feel that they should be putting a little more effort to please the customers.   
Would I come back? Probably.
Will I recommend this place to a friend? Yes, with a warning.",0,0,0,0,0

It ruined our evening, my mom even came home sick. Iâm not used to this and I will be contacting the manager tomorrow. Everyone was busy and overwhelmed last night. I couldnât here myself talk over the music so I figured I would reach out to management on a different day. Super disappointed",0,0,0,0,0
27,"First time there, heard so much about this place. The place looks run down, the sign said proper attire but you had people dressing like they are going to Walmart; jeans, flannels, soccer jerseys, so donât expect the people to respect the rules nor is it enforced. The bar was packed, so we waited outside and thereâs just no ambiance. Got seated, and the relish plate to cleanse your palette is disgusting, the bread served with it was cold. Our server was polite and delightful but she didnât tell us about any specials, she delivered us a cheese bread ( probably because she forgot to give us proper introductions). The place is SO LOUD and not romantic, too many tables jammed in that the waiters can pass by with plates or proper tableside. Our food was okay, the petit filet should have been ordered with the pepper sauce, it overpowered the taste of the steak; which was cooked perfect. Husbands dish was also very good, wine pairings were available to match the sauces. I wonât be back, it was just too overpriced for a good steak that I can elsewhere and with better ambiance and dinner selections.",0,0,0,0,0

29,"What a costly disappointment.  First comes the traditional relish tray with mostly ice and a few sparse not-so-fresh items.  Then the cheese bread tasting oily.  ""There are three different guys in the kitchen making it and they all think they have the best wayt!""  - our waitress.   Stick to your old formula!  Then the Caesar was NOT made tableside (SO disappointing).  The lobster tail was so average ($82.00).  The big prime rib ($60.00) ordered ""medium"" had no pink and was NOT tender.  What has happened?  So expensive and everything was not up to their standard.  Not sure if I will take the chance again.  It is a shame that they would allow this.  They seem to overbook and it steals from the ambiance.  We spent a fortune for a meal and it was a huge disappointment.  Also, we got there early...there was a sign for the valet price...when we left to get our car the price had gone up!!  And this is the second time we have been in the lounge and the Latina bartender could not smile and be cordial.  An attitude like you were interrupting her-the big boss-couldn't be bothered.  Just rude.",0,0,0,0,0
30,"Service was horrible, food took 1.5 hours to be served with a reservation. Was celebrating a 50th birthday and not once did the waitress acknowledge this.

No courtesy when they spoke to us, and never checked in on us even when the place was only half full.  We had to ask twice for more drink.  We had to look around for 10 minutes asking for a to-go box and the check.  When we left, no one even bothered to say thank you or goodbye.  I felt like I owe them a million bucks.  It's beyond me.  Never again!",0,0,0,0,0
33,My experience was very poor my girlfriend and I went to have dinner she did not like the sauce on her veal. We asked our waitress to take it back when they returned a new plate without the sauce it was the same veal beyhadh you scrape the sauce off of it we asked the waitress if it was the same one she said no she recanted and said it was the manager then came and stated that they had scraped off the sauce but it was the same veal. A $40 dish and the only complimented us dessert. The that type of Steakhouse that is supposed to be they do not have scraped off the sauce. It was a a very bad experience,0,0,0,0,0
34,"Weâve been coming here since I was in high school, and this by far was the WORST experience ever! Yes, I understand it was New Years Eve, BUT our server was honestly awful. Our table next to us who was sat after us, received their bread, drinks and salads before we even got our first drinks and water, and then when our salads finally came our server had our order wrong. We were sat next to the thermostat and another server squeezed her way in between our table to change the temperature and her butt was literally on our table for what seemed forever and not one excuse me or pardon me like are you kidding me !!??! Thatâs soo awful! Our server never checked in on us, our plates were piling on our table never cleared. That table next to us even had desert before our entrees came out.

35,"When we made the reservation on open table, we indicated that it was for our anniversary.  In the past, we were seated in the better lit section of the restaurant and a complimentary dessert was given to us.  This time, we were seated in the ""holiday"" section where it was difficult getting in and out of booth.  There wasn't anything festive about the atmosphere.  The waitstaff did not engage us.  Never did they ask if we were celebrating a special occasion.  We were actually celebrating, not only our 29th anniversary, but our son's first job.
It took a long time to bring the food.  The salad was good, but the entrees did not come out at room temperature...as if it had been sitting awhile.

We've always loved celebrating at Dal Rae's in the past, but this experience will send us looking elsewhere next year",0,0,0,0,0
36,"We have come here many times over the years. This was our first time back in about two years. The food was average however the service and noise level was absolutely unacceptable. I understand that everyone can have a bad night however this was much more than that. The only good thing that occurred was we ran into a server from another one of our favorite restaurants.

39,"We have been coming to the Dal Rae for twenty years. We went 6/25/18 for our wedding anniversary with a party of 5 at 6:30pm. Our server Monica was very flustered and difficult to understand. When our salads came out to be prepped at the same time as the table next to us, she actually asked if she could give us their salad dressing because she accidentally put egg in it-instead if making us a fresh salad. Then she proceeded to give us the incorrect salad order for myself and my husband. The garlic cheese bread that we usually love was hard and chewy and cold. Monica was very confused by our entree orders and had to come back twice to verify specifics. When the entrees arrived, my motherâs salmon was over cooked and cold. My fatherâs ribeye, which he orders every time we come, was unseasoned and disappointing. My husbandâs prime rib was so undercooked and rare (he ordered medium-well, he could not eat it and had to send it back. It took 15 minutes for Monica to bring it back. My crab legs were fine, but the side of creamed corn I ordered came out significantly later than my crab. We were so excited to spend our anniversary at the Dal Rae. We left feeling like everything was an issue and that we were not important guests. There was a table next to us that a Congressman who was sitting at it and it seemed as if they were getting extra special attention and we were ignored. Sadly, we will not be going back to the Dal. It was a very expensive dinner that was average at best.",0,0,0,0,0

From there on everything went sour.  First they didn't ask if we had any preference where we would like to sit (we would of stood at the bar to wait to be seated  at our preference) they took us straight to the outside where there was no music, then it started to get worse, it took 1/2hr. (Literally) to get any drinks. Plus to make things worse we didn't get our food till 9:40p.m. if I knew the food was going to take this long, my wife and I would have not ordered The Ribeye and Lobster.

42,"I have heard so much about this place but have never been.  So I made early dinner reservations on Valentineâs Day.  My personal opinion is that it is way overrated.  My wife and I have been to many nice restaurants, but this isnât one of them.  Place is rather worn down but has a rather snobby attitude about it.  Waitress had no knowledge of the wines they offered.  I ordered the filet mignon peppersteak which they are supposed to be famous for, medium rare.  My wife ordered the ribeye cooked medium.  My filet came out medium well and hers came out medium rare.  We informed the waitress, and all she said was âdid you like it?  Iâll make sure and tell the kitchenâ.  That was it, no attempt to make it right in any way.  Iâm not one to make a scene or ask for management to come talk to me, so we just left, $320+ dinner for 2 disappointment .  Never will return.

As I mentioned I am a Regular at Dal Rae and I'm sure ill be back but I can honestly say This visit was the Worst Experience was THE WORST. I've had better at Denny's.

46,"I had planned for a dinner at Dal Rae with my spouse with a reservations for 5:00 pm. I arrived on time expecting to be seated shortly as the hostess indicated that it would be a few minutes to be seated. As I stepped away from the podium another customer approached the hostess and was clearly upset that they had arrived 15 minutes early for their 5:00 pm reservations and had to wait an additional 15 minutes for a table. The hostess replied that the restaurant had seated 150 people at 4:00pm and there would be a wait and she could not provide an estimated time when she could seat them. As time elapsed approximately 40 minutes after we arrived, we inquired about the status of our reservation and were told that our table was still not ready and there were still another 3 couples ahead of us. This was too much for me and we left the restaurant. I do not understand the point of making the reservation at this restaurant if they do not intended on honoring the reservation. When I make a reservation and arrive on time for it, I expected not to wait an unreasonable period of time as this restaurant did. I am positive that if I had been late equal to the amount of time we waited, the restaurant would not have kept our reservation open. There is no excuse for the restaurantâs management to make a customer wait for their reservation due to the restaurants lack of forethought for seating 150 guests at one time and how it would affect the customers later in the evening. There are plenty of good restaurants in the area that will keep their reservations. To add insult to injury the restaurant reported to Open table that we were a no show. The restaurant lost a valuable customer over this issue.",0,0,0,0,0

We had an 8:00 reservation, but wasn't seated until 8:30. That is ok, availability is dependent upon patrons generally- but after we were seated and it took 10 minutes to see our waiter, we suspected something was up. The waiter came and took our drink order, and we also ordered the artichoke crab appetizer. 10 minutes later, the waiter returns with our drinks (he didn't know what a dark and stormy was, I had to explain it, and what he brought had light rum not spiced dark rum and was $14),  and told us the specials and asked if we wanted to order an appetizer. Another red flag. We reminded him we ordered the appetizer when we ordered drinks. He hadn't put it in. He apologized and went and put it in. We didn't see our waiter again for 15 minutes (dinner order not yet taken) and he asks what we want for our main dish. We order, including a side. 10 more minutes pass and the appetizer arrives (finally) and the dish is mediocre and not overly hot given it must have sat a while. 25 more minutes pass, and our meals arrive - minus the side we ordered. After putting our dishes down he asks if he can do anything else. I ask about the side, which he obviously forgot, and he says it was up and he would go get it (note a small side of mushrooms and his tray was 45% empty). Out of frustration at the poor service my wife cancelled the side, the waiter was confused and kept pushing that he will bring it, and she insisted that he cancel it. He goes away, comes back with the mushrooms muttering (I'm not kidding) that he doesn't want them to go to waste and he will take it off the bill. All of that for mushrooms that were unremarkable at best. We never saw the waiter again - another waiter in the area was available for getting us boxes and eventually the bill.

I was sorry for asking for the pager she had just asked me to come back for since there was none available when I checked in... it just seemed like they way over booked.

I also got the chateubriand for two. So would I come back...nope. I feel cheated.

The service was horrible, was not given a wine list, so I asked our server for a glass of pinot noir, she dropped it off never explaining anything about the vintage or brand, still don't know what I drank, later was served prime rib with no Au Jus sauce, the food was mediocre, and it just seemed liked nobody cared, complete waste of $200, will not go back",0,0,0,0,0

First we got there few minutes before our reservation and we were sitting down on the outside waiting area and one of the guys from the restaurant came and took our chairs because he said they  needed them.

After, we got  seated way after our reservation time (25 mins or so) We had to ask the waiter for the food menus as she had forgotten to bring them to us. We ordered our food and boy that took a long time, if you are hungry this isn't the place to visit. It took them over an hour after we order our meals before they can serve us. By this time we were frustrated and ready to go, can't say I'll recommend or ever be going back. For the price of the meals  you are better off treating your self to a nice dinner in an elegant place in Beverly Hills. This place was not organized when it came to attending people from the minute you arrive to the minute you are served. I don't paying high prices for my meals, but one thing i can't stand is poor service. Seems like they have frequent visitors that get better service, as long as they are not new faces.

82,"We came to Dal Rae for my fatherâs birthday celebration. We brought him here last year and had a great time. This time we invited other family members and made a reservation several weeks in advance, but it was disappointing. We were seated at a round table in the main dining room rather than a booth we had requested. My brotherâs seat was wet - they wiped it down but we realized after there was a leak from the vent above dripping down on his arm. The owner wouldnât move us to a corner booth because someone more important had requested it and instead he had the table scooted over a few feet so I was then smashed up to the people at the next table. They were unhappy about it as well.

The waitress was nice, but clueless. We had to keep asking for her to take our drink order and then it still took forever for them to come. We ordered a Caesar salad, which a man came and made - it tasted good until I found several slimy blobs and I immediately stopped eating it. After that we waited about 45 mins for our food and wine. We wanted to enjoy our time and not rush, but it got awkward after awhile. The waitress said she called for our food to be picked up, which arrived and then sat on the serving trays next to us waiting for her to come pass it out. A few items were wrong and my husbandâs steak was cold, but whatever. We let it go because they were busy.

After the meal, they brought my dad dessert and we sang happy birthday. The check came, we paid over $600 and as we were finishing up our conversation, a man in a checkered coat came and told us they needed the table and we had to leave. Seriously? We were patient the whole time with the table issues, the inept waitress, the super slow service and they had the nerve to be so rude? Wow. On the way out we told the hostess about it who said it wasnât her fault. We told her to let the owner know and that we wonât be back.

Last night, was so disappointing.  My best friend and I came here for my birthday (which was stated on our reservation), We were seated, ""no HBD"" acknowledgement.  The waitress had no enthusiasm and acted like she just wanted the day to be over.  My usual order consists of the crab cakes, a ceasar salad and if I'm really hungry the sea bass.  Last night the crab cakes were mushy and the ceasar salad dressing wasn't creamy like it had been in the past.  This time it was very soggy and salty - I didn't even eat half of it.  The waitress vanished so we were not able to tell her about the salad.  My friend had the french onion soup to start and was disappointed that they skimped on the cheese on top of the bowl. The cheese didn't even touch the sides of the bowl.  For dessert we ordered the mini pumpkin pie with the description as ""creamy pumpkin and a shortbread crust.""  The pie we got was a slice of pie which tasted supermarket bought.  It did not have a shortbread crust!!!  The only time the waitress was fast was when she brought us the check and processed the credit card.

Even though the waitress tried, but she was handling too many tables, busperson the same, owner should hire more workers.

We were seated at 9:00 p.m. but our prime rib dinners (3) did not get to our table until 10:00 p.m.  We were told that they stagger the food orders to it all does not come at once, thus, the delay.  The problem is that our other food never arrived so there was nothing to stagger.  The table of 4 to our left had their entire meals for free because they were louder than we were about complaints to the manager.

I wonder if we were to be placed in the regular dining space if we would have had a chance at making our own choice if we wanted a salad or dessert and if they would have served duck.

Drinks were fine. Bread basket ok. A random iced dish with veggies (why?). Hot Parmesan bread was good. Appetizers were small and not worth the price, though the taste was ok.

We all shared the Hearts of Romaine and Grilled Artichoke. I expected more out of the Hearts of Romaine salad to be more than just a wedge of Romaine Lettuce with a dash of Caesar Dressing. It was too plain. The Grilled Artichoke was just ok. It came with 2 sauces. I got to try the Dae Rae 14oz Filet Mignon at Medium Rare, which was actually more rare than I liked. I will say though, that the peppered crust was really good. That...I was impressed with. As for dessert, we got the New York Cheesecake with Raspberry Syrup. It was a good cheesecake but not the best. The crust was rock solid and hard to eat.

Overall, I think for the price, I'll go somewhere else for steak like Clearman's Steak n' Stein. The ambiance was romantic and the lighting was dim. It is definitely a place for the older crowd. My friends and I were the youngest ones there.",1,1,1,1,1

Great start...The tables were on top of each other. My husband felt like if he scratched his back he'd hit the guy behind him. The food was okay, but nothing special. Hubby had an average steak. The Lobster Thermidor tasted kind of off, hard to describe, just off. My son said the Penne Arrabiata lacked any heat. It wasn't actually bad, just borning. They didn't even wish me a happy birthday.

The filet mignon was flavorless and took more time to cut then I expected. I was hoping for it to melt in my mouth.  The mashers were extra buttery which I enjoyed.  The food took a long time.  Our server was nice but seemed aloof.  When we asked about the pre-fix menu she didn't bother checking to see if they offered it she said that it was over on Easter but on the bill we received it said the exact dates.

211,"I remember when the Dal Rae was a quiet and intimate Steakhouse.

Now it's just as noisy as a contemporary Steakhouse, whilst retaining food quality that has kept this place relevant.

Fried zucchini for a starter, while slow to come out was _very_ tasty and a delight to eat.

Table-side Caesar salad was tasty, but me missus could eat much of hers...way too much Parmesan cheese. 

Steaks were coked perfectly and the grilled asparagus was also perfect. I don't know how the Dal Rae still calls the 'Famous'  pepper steak a pepper steak. What I got was a green, semi-leafy, pesto-like spread which, after one bite I pushed to the side of my plate.

PRO: Excellent service, wonderful food prepared and plated with care.
CON: Just another noisy (albeit tasty) Steakhouse.",0,0,0,0,0

Food was brought out and it was not cooked per our request. Has to ask the hostess to help because our waitress kept disappearing.

238,"Dal Rae is okay but not great as I expected it it to be. I spent over $200 for a dinner of three and felt the food was just okay. Also, I could only order fries for my little 2 year old because they had no kids friendly menu or kid entrees.

As for the service, the time we waited for our food was also okay. Not too long and just fine. This said, our server Miguel was very well mannered and polite. Love how he presented the food and took care of making it a special experience as best he could. He was excellent.

Something about this place and their food reminds me of when you go to a wedding event and the quality level of their entrÃ©es. So expect it to be similar but not different or special. Just good.

As for the ambience, it was really dated and certainly needs updating with at least some livelier new paint colors. A bit somber, especially the carpet and ceiling panels which need to be replaced.  

A pet peeve of mine was how the dress code was not enforced as business casual and saw many many people in their very casual clothes and some even in house shorts. Reminds me of when people go to form a line at a buffet in Las Vegas. Definitely not the upscale restaurant I was told it was and think I can get better for my money, elsewhere. Plus, they had no live music as I read a review or website somewhere mentioned. 

I took my wife and kids for motherâs day for the first time at Dal Rae and will not come again unless the owners show pride of ownership and bring up their brand with a fresh interior that we can say wow, this place is great! I think the owners have given up on making their restaurant modern for new foodies compared to say the look of a Cheesecake Factory or any newer restaurant. My assumption is they have an older loyal base of patrons who donât know the difference. If you are looking for a lunch meeting, this crowd might show this feeling I have from my past visit 4 years ago. Too pricey for what you get here if you ask me.

Gabriella was the server and she was not interested in serving. Her attentiveness was comparable to what you experience at Chiliâs. It was so far below what we have come to expect at the Dal Rae over the years weâve been patronizing it. I asked the assistant manager about the drop in level of service. He said it was due to Covid. I told him the baked potatoes used to be prepared by the server. He mumbled about Covid. I pointed out that the other tables around us received that. Our table didnât. But our table had Gabriella as the server. He said he would talk to her. I asked him to do that after we left. I couldnât take a chance on her service deteriorating further. The filet pepper steaks were so-so. My wifeâs was done to perfection and was definitely a prime cut. It was a melt in your mouth cut. Mine was chewy and way overdone. I asked Gabriella twice for a small dish of Bernaise sauce to make it palatable. She finally brought it after a lengthy wait. She acted annoyed by us. She dropped by just a few times during our meal. I waited patiently since my steak was not edible as presented from the kitchen. This was not an experience to remember.

I am glad to offer my comments as a positive critique from a fan of your fine restaurant.

Honestly I have to say I was very disappointed with the food quality this time. I ordered the Dal Rae Club, but it was dry and was in no way exceptional- having your good name attached to it.  My two other guests ordered the prime rib lunch special, and they both thought that was unremarkable too.

When we ordered a soufflÃ© for dessert I was told that the 35 minute wait would upset the hostess because they wanted our table. She said tbe hostess would kick her butt for not telling us they had soufflÃ© earlier. Who says that?  I ordered something else instead. We spent $200 for dinner snd would have liked to have been treated with a little more respect.

308,"We have been coming here for years, and always love the food and the ambiance.  Our waitress was great and the food was wonderful (pepper filet, chilean sea bass, prime rib).  The only disappointment was the blonde hostess who was rude.  We were a party of six, and arrived in two separate cars about ten minutes from one another.  The other party were our guests and when they arrived, the hostess attempted to seat them in the patio room not the main dining room.  They went out to look at it, and besides being the only people in the room, the room was very cold (temperature wise).  They explained to the hostess that we wanted to sit in the main dining room which is much nicer and which is what really makes the restaurant so special.  The hostess then had them sit at the bar while they waited for us.  When we arrived, we checked in and told them we would wait at the bar with our guests until our table was ready.  After hearing nothing from the hostess for about half an hour, I went up to the hostess station to check on our table, and she asked if our guests had showed us the table in the patio room and if that would be ok for us.  I said that it would not be, and reminded her that it was cold in the patio room and that we wanted to be seated in the main dining room.  The hostess then barked at me stating that it would be at least another hour before we would be seated!  I was a bit taken aback, given that our reservation was for 6:00pm, and that at 6:30pm when I checked I was told it would be at least another hour before we would be seated.  I commented that an hour an a half wait did not speak very well for OpenTable reservations!  I went back to the bar and sat with our guests, and about twenty minutes later the hostess came up to me and said they had found another party of 6 that agreed to be seated in the patio room and that she could now seat us in the dining room.  I was pleased, and thanked her.  I must say that I found her attitude to be very rude.",0,0,0,0,0

We are really easy people to please as most of us have worked in the hospitality industry and we know how busy it can get during the holidays.  Not sure what happened on this day.  We had an early reservation for a party of 6 on Christmas Eve and we seemed to off to a good start until our server began telling us how many reservations were no shows and they should take a credit card for parties of 6 & above.   During our meal the restaurant never did get very busy and our server continued to give us a count of the no shows.  We ordered our wine and when that was delivered we ordered our meal and I had ordered the spinach salad as a first course and requested extra bacon and dressing.  We all decided it must have been a joke of some sort because when it was delivered there was at least a 12-16 oz of bacon on the salad and it was floating in dressing.  I am not exaggerating at all, there was more bacon than spinach and it was so drenched in dressing that it pooled to the edge of the plate.  I should have take a picture of it.  When my onion soup was delivered, the server said we did to offend our server, we were pretty low key, certainly not demanding in any way.  I will say that everyone else's meals were excellent (including their onion soup).  Then we ordered coffee which was delivered stone cold.  Not warm but stone cold.  It was a very disappointing evening in all.",0,0,0,0,0

That said, the ambiance once inside is that of an up scaled establishment though seriously dated but very well maintained. The staff is well trained and officious.

The Reuben was a mistake but it came with an extra large plate of thin cut fries. I had the stroganoff made with penne pasta. The sauce was lacking some key ingredients like worcestershire, catsup, sour cream. There was no sauce per se; only a coating on the pasta. The plate was large and full of meat. I was just disappointed with the flavors. We also shared some deep fried zuccini slices which were nice and crispy.

I had the Chinese Chicken salad, for a lunch with friends. Their salads, with lots of greens and turkey, were fine. Mine was OK, but the horseradish in the dressing, dominated flavors in my salad. I like horseradish, just not so much. It was an unwelcome surprise. As such, this was the first time I've ever been dissatisfied  with a dish here.

She brought a slice of lemon cake and didnât even sing Happy Bday. We then saw that the table next door had 3 waitresses sing Happy Bday! We felt that they didnât pay too much attention to us either, perhaps because we ordered from the Dine LA menu instead of the regular one? We did notice others celebrating bdays and even Anniversary and they got full attention! I went to the bathroom and looked at the table and saw what they had ordered  Oyster Rockefeller and the salad that is prepared table side as well as food not in the Dine LA menu. So my feeling was confirmed that they treat customers better and get more attention when itâs feomtje regular menu. Not a pleasant feeling! Will not be recommending this place!

I don't like that they don't write down our orders. I asked for very little dressing on my salad and it came drenched in dressing. My friend asked for mustard and dressing from the sandwich on the side and they added it to her sandwich. They took our drink order wrong.

335,"This was our 4th visit to Dal Rae and compared to the previous three times, the dining experience was a disappointment. First off, we've never reserved a table through open table which is perhaps why despite making reservations three weeks in advance, we were not seated in the main dining area, but rather the newly enclosed patio. While it was conducive to conversation (quieter especially since my father is acutely deaf), it was cold and nowhere near as ambiant. It was my parents first time there, so we were super excited to treat them to a fun night. Being seated out there was hugely disappointing. Then on top of it, the service was just so, so - not superior as it had been in the past. Our waitress seemed stressed from the moment she took our drink order. We had another waitress, who delivered out drinks take our appetizer order. It was just not an in sync tag team if our ask me. Anyway, the food was delicious, we had escargot, firecracker rock shrimp, the Caesar salad and all of us had the pepper steak. No complaints where the food is concerned. We made the most of our experience, but if we're going to go out and spend $500 we want it to be memorable in every way. Though we've have great experiences before, it is doubtful we'll be back. Thank you for allowing us to review our experience. Hopefully it will be helpful to others. And I strongly recommend calling the restaurant direct to request a table in the main dining area, especially during the holidays!

I think my chair must have been bumped at least 3 times by waitstaff rushing by to serve other tables. Other parties came and left as we waited and waited for our waitress. She was hard of hearing, and mis-heared a couple of items that I ordered, also didn't understand simple questions such as ""what are the sides that come with that entree?"" due to a hearing problem. She was not trained well enough to politely ask me to repeat what I'd said. The upshot of being ignored is to not feel like a valued customer.

It was our anniversary and my sister-in-laws birthday, so I made reservations for 4 people and a booth.  On the way to the restaurant, I was told there would be someone else joining us.  Because we ended up with 5 at dinner, and it was prime dinner time on a Saturday night, we were seated in a back room with a large birthday party.  The party was so loud (and obnoxious at times), that we couldn't enjoy our conversation.  We were also set right next to the bussing station, so wait staff was in and out, clanking dishes right next to us all night.  Twice, the extra guest at the end of the table was hit in the head with the waiters tray as he was clearing other tables, and continually bumped by wait staff as they passed by.  Unfortunately, it was not the special experience we hoping for or use to for our special occasion.  That said, the food was amazing as usual.  The tableside preparation of the Caesar salad, the Steak Diane, and the tableside flambÃ© dessert, are in a league of their own!  I had been craving the Caesar Salad since the last time we had dined at Dal Rae.  The filet mignons, no matter which one you get, are melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The price you pay for this fine dining experience is usually well worth it because you not only get fabulous, well prepared food, but you get a show with the old-school tableside preparations, and the wait staff is seasoned, professional, yet very friendly and accommodating.  Oh, and we love stopping at the piano bar and listening/dancing to oldies after dinner.  Even after this unfortunate experience, I can't wait to go back.

I get itâs Valentineâs Day, but I still expect some kind of service when the menu is only $80 per person plus drinks and appetizers if you choose. She took my drink order and then when my wife asked, âWhat kind of Moscatos go you haveâ the waitress replied with mojito flavors like mango and spearmint classic. We asked again if those were the types of moscatos and she replied, â yes sweetie, thatâs why it told you the first timeâ We agreed that Mango option would be a good try at something sweet so she picked it. After getting my drink which tasted like rubbing alcohol and my wifeâs drink was just as bad with a hint of mango, we asked our server about our drinks. I said I would get a coke and she commented, â too strong for you honey?â And when my wife mentioned the moscato, she said, â honey, you said mojito, not moscatoâ and began arguing with her about what she said. After that we went for food and asked her to recommend the best steak. She did and proceeded to take my wifeâs order. She came back about 15 minutes later to tell me that my choice( her recommend) was no longer available. So then I asked for another recommend and I ordered the Steak Diane. This reminds me. The time from sit to drinks was an hour and fifteen minutes. Food took an hour and fourth five minutes. 3 hours just on waiting time. It was ridiculous. Again, I get Valentineâs Day, but no one else got it as bad as us. Well, after the amazing, delicious food, we got the check and left. This is the recap from the first time.

And when we left she didn't even acknowledge us. She was busy talking to another employee. Normally we are greeted with a smile and we love Dal Rae it's  old school old money that makes this place.

369,"Went here for dineLA but was kind of disappointed with the lunch selections. If memory serves me correctly, the price was also a bit higher than what was listed. I had the poor man's pepper steak as the entree and was a bit disappointed with it. The ground beef was kind of mushy tasting which was probably better than being dry. But the sauce didn't have the punch I was expecting from the peppercorns. The spear of romaine/Caesar salad was good but  the dessert was the thing that saved the meal. I had the gold brick sundae which had a lace cookie like basket and it was delicious! Even though we were full, we ate almost the whole thing. My husband ordered the shrimp scampi as the other entree but found it to be only mediocre. We had wanted the prime rib lunch which we had once before but found out that they only served it on Thursdays and Fridays. Oh well, we'll just have to go back on one of those days.

She treated us like we were customers in a diner. Perfunctory and rude speech, calling us ""hon"" and ""sweetie"", mija and mijo, throwing the plates down in front of us, etc. She got my son's steak order wrong, and  then blamed us for the error.

373,"My fourth visit to Dal Rae. The ""Pepper Steak"",  a filet mignon covered with pepper and cooked in a special sauce, was wonderfully tender and tasty. The baked potato was perfect. Vegetable appetizers were fresh and appealing. The calamari was overcooked and only mildly warm. Bread was soft but not warm. Butter was cold and hard. House cabernet was pleasantly mild and well blended. Desert pecan pie was unheated, and ice cream topping was extra. After dinner cappuccino was bland. Table was extremely small, making it difficult for the three of us to eat comfortably. Service was extraordinarily good; we arrived at opening, when  there were few other customers. Still, service was attentive throughout the meal. Noise level was moderate; close-by  revelers occasionally made talking difficult to hear. Menu was limited to a Holiday special, one page menu. Prices were outrageous, even for a special holiday menu; since our last visit, several years ago, prices for this holiday menu have risen about 250%. Absolutely a rip-off and indefensible. Overall, the prices caused the value of the experience to be only fair, greatly offsetting the otherwise excellent food and outstanding service. Dal Rae needs to get its prices in line with reality, enlarge its tables for customer comfort, and take other small changes such as warming toast and offering soft, spreadable butter. Keep the great filet mignon, however. Finally, parking is by valet only.",0,0,0,0,0

Her other tables were somewhat neglected by her but at least her assistant helped on occasion. Just not with our table. Overall, the tables are far too close for quiet dinners and conversation.

Carole ordered the same option as I did, the chopped salad ,and found it to contain more blue-cheese that she was accustomed too. I had forgotten about the dressing.

That was disappointing.   I was surprised how expensive the dishes were even with the mediocre sides included.  Rice Pilaf?  Really.  

The reason to go to Dal Rey is for the meat though.  My filet which was over 3 inches high and wide could be cut with that butter knife.  My husband had the lamb chops which were amazing.  

Beware that the peppercorn rub is not that at all.  It is a stack of green onions, bacon and some peppercorns.  My son scraped it off, as he does not like onions.  They should actually re-name the rub as the Dal Rey signature rub which would be more truth in advertising.

We arrived 10 minutes early and we're dressed in lovely clothing. They took us to our table....in a stuff corner at the opening to the booming bar, facing the bus boy station. The hotess disappeared before we could speak. We went back to the hotess stand and I expressed my total disapproval of the table and reiterated the requests that I made when I made the reservation. They seated us at the next  table, 6 feet from the first, still with the bar but out of the line of site of the bus station.

Food was delicious and the service was acceptable. The prices are high but the food is scrumptious. I will never come here for a quiet, celebratory dining experience because it does not offer that anymore.

I have found better renditions at the Food Court at the mall. The Veal Piccata was decent yet very small portions in comparison to other dishes.

Not sure if I will ever order any of the beef entrees ever again.  A lot of their menu will sound too similar so emphasize what you order.

Food: We had the Ribeye Cap, Bone-In Ribeye & Mac n Cheese. Now, compared to Mastros, Flemings, Mortons, Del Friscos and Ruth Chris this place is well below my standard and ranks last. But still on the scale. For the pricing they have id chose mastros or mortons as they are fairly similar.

Wait time: Too long for even the Caesar salad to come.

Ambiance: Old school, vintage decor & booths. The tables are so close to each other that people coming & going kept turning sideways, not to mention the servers bumping Into the table. The place exemplifies maximizing space. I saw the busser go around two times around the tables to try and bring my ice tea. The music from the bar was too loud for the primary dining room, but if I was in the bar, it would be a vibe.

And, the menu was not as extensive. Example - the small portion of pepper steak had been eliminated along with some other items. I do understand that some food items are difficult to get right now, or maybe this was due to the holiday period.

The time in between her checkups were about 25-30 minutes in between. If we didnât have the amazing piano bar to keep us occupied, i'm certain we wouldâve grown frustrated and walked out. NOT ONLY THAT, but upon knowing that her service was sub par, some would say bottom of the barrel, we still tipped her 50 dollars. She had the nerve and the AUDACITY to bring the receipt back and tell us that we were supposed to tip 70 dollars or more because of the 15% gratuity. We calculated it out and it was only supposed to be 59, EVEN THEN, she was lucky to even get the 50 after we had to serve ourselves our own drinks and constantly call her over to have someone get the dishes off the table as well as deal with long waits. I found it extremely disrespectful to rub the gratuity in our faces like that. We told a host what happened and they were extremely supportive, I didnât catch their names but they were lovely gals.

559,"-Ambiance: Lovely, feels high-end.
-Service: Outstanding and attentive, with two minor exceptions: I put down in the reservation that it was our anniversary, but there was no acknowledgement of that at all, except from a gentleman host who was going from table to table asking if it was a special occasion for anyone. I didn't expect a party, but the waiter didn't seem to know it was our anniversary. Also, the waiter tended to take appetizers away before we were quite done, without asking (took our bread basket when there was still one slice left, and later we stopped them when they tried to take the remains of the melted cheese from the stuffed mushrooms). But I would still rate the service as outstanding.
-Appetizers: Good, but we didn't ""love"" them. The stuffed mushrooms were really tasty, but there was too much cheese sauce. And the wedge salad was drowning in oil-and-vinegar dressing -- it was actually dripping from each bite, so you had to lean over your plate to avoid it dripping onto your clothes. And the escargots had so much garlic in them that they just weren't good. The escargot was the only item we just didn't like.
-Entrees: Steaks were cooked to PERFECTION. The filet mignon was so tender you could almost cut it with a fork. It was on the rarer side of medium rare, but that is just fine with me! Only thing: we felt they were under-seasoned. We both added salt to our steaks. The pepper sauce was good, but the meat itself seemed like it had no seasoning on it at all.  But still delicious.
-Dessert - I thought the creme brulee was excellent. The caramelized sugar was on the thick side, just like I like it. 
-Wines - GREAT wine list, and most of them very reasonably priced.

So, the short version: Ambience and service were outstanding. Terrific wine list. Appetizers tended to be over-sauced or over-seasoned; meat was perfectly cooked but under-seasoned. But we both said we would definitely come here again.",0,0,0,0,0

574,"Dal Rae was just superb.  The escargot was delicious, the drinks were on point and the service was great overall.  My only gripe was the fact that my steak came out medium when I had asked for medium-rare.  I asked the server and he said, ""yes, that is medium-rare."" I've worked in a steak house and this was not medium-rare. The texture and the taste were not there either.  I asked them if they could please prepare a medium-rare steak and he obliged, but it was a little off-putting when he said that this was their medium-rare.  I also asked for two portions of asparagus since I did not want a starch and I was provided with 3 asparagus spears!  If I had two portions of asparagus on my plate, I'd hate to see the single portion which would have been 1.5 spears of asparagus!  Again, he said that this was their double portion. Fast forward, my steak came out shortly and it was fantastic. It was a totally different steak with a fantastic flavor and the texture of the protein was just what I was expecting.  Great job, Kitchen!  I also had about 12 spears of asparagus on my plate when it came out. I believe the manager came out to deliver the plate, so that was excellent in terms of the manager that is present that night being attentive to the patrons and knowing that a good manager visits with their patrons.

595,"Normally, I give the Dal Rae 5 stars. There were 9 of us, and things got a bit crazy, as people arrived at different times. The server was not on ""top"" of things as usual, and we had to track the server down to get orders taken. One person ordered the steamed clams, and nearly half of them didn't open. The dish had to be remade--sort of surprising for the Dal! I ordered the Petrale Sole, and normally the server asks how it should be prepared. That step was forgotten, and I had forgotten, and wound up with sauteed fish vs. the lemon butter sauce with capers that I normally enjoy. Hence, lots of food, but not my favorite preparation of such a delicate fish. There was no refill on the bread, asked for more butter, no butter. It was just sort of chaotic. On the GREAT side, is Dianne Gire, who is the keyboard artist/singer (we were in the lounge). She is so fabulous. Our friend, Patti, sang with her, a regualar, Gale, joined in at times.

609,"Let me start off by saying I have been to this restaurant an estimated 50 times throughout my adult life. Growing up in Whittier the Dal Rae was always the first choice for special occasions with friends and endless family celebrations. From the way you are first greeted by the well-mannered hostess, too the bartenders who how and what to pour, I guarantee you will start you evening off with polished intentions. The high walled leatherette booths and crisp white linens takes you back to a bygone era of elbows off the table. 
But perhaps the grand dame of steakhouses has fallen a bit behind on itâs kitchen excellence. My meal of appetizer scallops, wedge salad and beef medallions we all good, but not great. The scallops were butter tender but the cheese sauce was a bit congealed, almost velveeta-segue. The iceberg wedge was as expected but itâs plate warm to the touch and the blue cheese dressing a bit runny. The filet medallions were a little over cooked for medium rare, and the smaller than expected baked potato hand a hard callus like skin texture. Donât  think by this Luke-warm description I was unhappy with my meal, I was not. Ive just been more impressed in the past. I just have to come to a realization that times have changed and, the clientele is different. Alas perhaps the combination of Covid and the underdressed Gen-Z clientele, has allowed this once five star establishment to slip a bit.

We ordered martinis and a margarita which were so strong we each only had one. My cucumber martini was very smooth, chilled, with only a hint of sweetness which was lovely. My husbandâs dirty martini was initially delivered âcleanâ but was followed up by a generous snifter of olive juice that he then added himself.

The food was plentiful and very, very rich. Lots of bread, and tons of butter! Their Cesar dressing has some type of sweetening agent which I thought was odd, and the dressing was a little heavy handed, but the house made croutons were delicious. My sea bass was flaky and flavorful. The sauce and the accompanying scalloped potatoes were again, loaded with butter. Asparagus was cooked al dente. My husband ordered the signature peppered filet which was cooked to perfection medium rare, but surprisingly not very peppery! My mother-in-law had the regular filet which she said was overcooked. The kids had generous servings of chicken fingers that they swore were the best theyâd ever had at a restaurant. Very crispy, including sides of steak fries and a baked potato. The desserts (bowls of ice cream and a slice of chocolate torte drizzled in caramel sauce) were a little uninspiring.

We were greeted by a friendly and professional team and perhaps by the Manager.  The food overall was good.  However, the pepper steak provided in the Dine LA menu was not a real steak but it was an overly seasoned ground beef topped with a ton of toppings to add more flavor to the already salty patty.   The service was good too and found that our waitress may be overwhelmed as the restaurant became crowded half-way through our lunch.  In any case, she was very attentive and provided good services.   She was, however, impatient when one of us asked what is included in the pork-chop.  She couldn't explain and stated that it is ""basically a pork chop"".  So it ended there.  But overall she gave her best to serve us.  We dine here every year and feel that the food has not been the same standard.  Perhaps the DINE LA menu is very much different than the one they have on the regular menu.  I hope that they look into providing the same quality of food provided for DINE LA.

842,"My wife and enjoyed the Dal Rae in the past, and after a very busy Christmas week, she wanted a break from cooking. We had a reservation on Friday 12/29 at 6:30PM just prior to the restaurant getting very busy.

We were greeted and taken to our table. At the time the restaurant was about 50% full. The Christmas dÃ©cor was nice. 

The table spacing in the main room was too tight for the type of service that is expected for a ""premium"" restaurant. 

As the restaurant became full, the food service was somewhat hampered by the amount of  isle area to both allow guest and waiters to pass from table to table. This could be solve by removing one table and making the pathway more accessible.

We prompt had our drink order taken, and shortly after were serviced an excellent assortment of bread and a fresh vegetable platter.

Our server was somewhat disorganized as the room filled up, and we found a somewhat diminished level of service to our table. We had to ask for menu's after 5-10 minutes.

The food was very good. My wife had the sea bass, which was very good. My NY pepper steak ( was good, but I liked the prime rib I had previously better. side dishes were fine.

Once dinner was finished, it took us about 10 minutes to receive back our bill for payment once we tended our credit card.

Why?  I couldn't see to cut around the fat.  And I will add that my vodka tonic was flat.

891,"We had a delicious dinner at the Dal Rae. Our food was cooked perfectly, properly seasoned, and presented with care. Our steak and lobster was perfect, and I think I had the best baked potato I've ever had--mostly because of the care our server took in preparing it tableside. 

Some unfortunate early issues made me concerned how wise it was to come here for my birthday. 

We waited over forty minutes for our seven o'clock reservation. When I asked about our table at 7:20, I was told diners were done but not leaving the tables. I understand, but I wondered if any effort was made to gently encourage them to go.

When we were seated at 7:45,  there was some wet food on the seat, and I waited for someone to bring me a napkin so I could wipe it off. Then when I got to my place setting, my fork was clearly caked with dried food. 

I don't like to cause a scene or make a fuss, so things like this make me uncomfortable.

Initially, our server seemed inexperienced. We weren't told about any specials or asked if we had any questions. 

Somehow, I felt like we were at the afterthought table--the one that didn't get much attention. 

Our server was very nice, as was the terrific man who packed my leftovers, but I was expecting impeccable service, and we didn't receive that until late in our meal. 

Also, I wrote a note on our reservation that we were excited for our first visit and we were celebrating my birthday, but no one seemed aware of either. 

The food was really superb, and every employee was so nice. But the restaurant is so crowded and chaotic, I would really need superior service to enjoy another visit.",0,0,0,0,0

However, by the time I got to desert, the waitress told me that they could no longer offer it because the menus had switched from Lunch to Dinner.

918,"I've been coming to the Dal Rae for 15+ years, but usually for business lunches.  On a recent Saturday evening (11/12/16), I was disappointed in the handling of the reservation.  We had a 7:30pm reservation, and arrived at 7:15 and checked in.  We got the ""buzzer"" and headed to the bar, which was jammed, for a drink and to wait.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait.  At 7:45pm, I went to ask how the wait was and when we could expect to be seated and was told - very soon, there are people who are done but aren't leaving.  OK ... I get ""lingering"" but at a high end place with lots of people waiting, hosts should be ready to help gently move people along.  At 8:05 I asked again and now was told that the host was indeed talking to the tables where they had been long done.  We were finally seated at around 8:15 or 8:20.   That frankly didn't get the evening off to a joyous start.  We went from anticipating the meal to being starved, to just being ready to get in and eat and out.

The food itself was Dal Rae standard.  Meats prepared to order.  Tableside Caesar features the old fashioned preparation, including a real egg lightly coddled and added in along with anchovies and so on.  Chilled salad forks and plates make sure greens stay fresh. Prices are high, but you get high-quality beef or seafood.  Dinner for 2 with 1 cocktail, 1 glass of wine, 1 dessert, tableside Caesar, and two entrees was about $180.00.  

I think they should scrap the side of sliced tomatoes if they're not going to serve flavorful heirlooms ... 20-40 years ago people accepted the flavorless icebox beefsteak tomatoes, but today those seem very dated and not at all tasty. Those were a complete miss.

Flourless chocolate cake was good but I didn't find the accompanying coffee ice cream to add much - a good vanilla bean would be a better complement, or else amp up the flavor of the coffee ice cream.

Service was good though busy and rather harried in the early (sort of) part of the dinner.",0,0,0,0,0

the way she welcome people, is rude, careless and unkind, ""Hi"" of course I made sure that she can see my disappointment  telling her ""what wrong with Good Evening"" this is a complain that  I report before, nothing has been  change, but is the first and last impression you have, it is a shame that after I report, talk to the owner, nothing has been done.

This attitude would not stop me to visit Dal Rae, however, in some instances I will visit other restaurants for this attitude, is annoying that after you talk to the owner, send an email, this continue, my wife birthday is July 10, 2016 however, Richard Barrantes that he is a frequent customers in there, asked my wife her preference, she decided to visit another restaurant in Pasadena, you food is great, you service is great, the owner and Sommelier  are great, but the hostesses' welcome is not acceptable.

I am sure that the owner remember me, I was in the first table with two beautiful woman, he said hello in this date (Wednesday)

948,"Dal Rae has the feeling of a mature restaurant.  I've heard of it from locals for years.  We gave it a try for our friend's 60th birthday.  From the entrance we were greeted in a friendly and welcoming manner.  We had a reservation, were able to be seated quickly.  The noise level was quite good for us.  The dining room was not noiseless, but we were able to have a relaxing conversation at our table.  Service was timely, friendly, and not pushy.  We had time to ask questions about menu items and to think about what to order.  The menu looks kind of old school, but our choices were well prepared and delicious.  They prepared the duck with an orange sauce at table side and my friend enjoyed it.  We also saw other tables having other items being prepared table side like Caesar salad and something that looked like Bananas Foster, and they all looked well done.  
Prices are not cheap, but with the quality of the food and service, along with the somewhat formal ambiance, I'm going to go again and try other items on their menu.
Good experience for us.",0,0,0,0,0

Server was both friendly and attentive.  We particularly liked the table side salad preparation and noted that several patrons were there celebrating birthdays.

964,"We love going to Dal Rae for special occasions, and were really looking forward to the Chilean sea bass.  It was very good, but not quite up to the usual standard we have come to expect.  We went on a Tuesday and did not recognize any of the wait staff, so are unsure as to whether there has been a large turnover in staff or that this was a day off for the regular staff (many have been there for years).  So perhaps the chef was a backup and not the regular chef.  Again the sea bass was very good, but it wasn't exceptional.

We will definitely return again, not on a Tuesday, to see if we just caught them on a slightly off night.",1,1,1,1,1

If Dal Rae's packed, you can bet the noise level's high and wait time for food can be trying. If you enjoy cocktails, you won't have difficulty passing time. And no short pours.
You can count on each course being exceptional.

We convinced the family to go on Friday night but little did we know that on holidays it is a special menu. Since it was Mother's Day weekend, the Caesar salad was a pre mixed bottle dressing that was not good. We did not know there is holiday menu on special days so check before you go..

I had the filet mignon pepper steak and it was cooked just the way I like it - medium rare.  We had the baked scallops cava de oro to start which we have been getting for 20 years.  The only thing was the scallops this time were not  the large tender ones we were used to getting.  Ours were small and a bit tough.  That is the only thing that was off.

However, there were, as I said, 4 adults and we were squeezed into a booth that would comfortably only hold 3 adults normally. That is my only complaint. We have been there many times for lunch and have always enjoyed the wide array of choices and the dinner menu was equally varied. I had a spinach salad and pasta, which was very good. My friend had Chilean Sea Bass, which she said was delicious. And the 2 men had the filet pepper steak, which is the specialty, and both enjoyed it thoroughly...",0,0,0,0,0

There was a musical act that was performing 80's jams for an older crowd, and the noise could be heard all over the dining room.  A bunch of rowdy, drunken people getting excited about Cameo's ""Word Up"" is not my idea of a romantic dinner.  I wish Lorin Smith would do a better job of finding musical acts that fit the Dal Rae ambience.  If there could be a way to have performers like Marty and Elayne (from the Dresden), Dal Rae would be the best.",0,0,0,0,0

We were never ask after that if there would be any other drinks. No tea,soda,etc. Afterthe desert was over then she ask if we would like coffee. We  ask for cheese bread and she said it would take a few extra mins. It never came. So over all it was ok .Just not what we normally have. Last year was so so good on all areas that maybe we are spoiled .",0,0,0,0,0
